"The custom voice commands I use for Siri to track my work hours (using the app ""Toggl Track"")  just suddenly stopped working - anyone else experience somthing similar?     I  use the shortcuts every day to start and stop a timer, but when I tried  ""start work"" this morning, Siri just responded ""I can't see an app for  that. You need to download one"". Also, I was asked to unlock the phone first, which the two shortcuts has never necessitated.     I already have an app for that. It's the same app as it was yesterday?      I  tried deleting the shortcuts and setting them up again, same phrases,  but I still getting the same error message. It seems my other shortcuts  can still be voice controlled.   The shortcuts still work manually, but it was just very easy with voice.  Any suggestions of what might be the issue?"
I created this which is actually a mix of shortcuts that gives you a productive experience with Siri.   [English Version](https://gumroad.com/l/NsJyz)  [French Version](https://gumroad.com/l/JjWAz)  [Emoji Version](https://gumroad.com/l/wCohf)
"Is it an issue on my device or (hope not) a feature.  * When I shazam song using Shazam App, the song is added to My Music inside of Shazam App * But when I use siri, the is not added to Shazam App  Note that I don't have Apple Music subscribtion"
"Hey! I‚Äôm using Siri for my videos. (German language) But out of nowhere, Siri sounds like a broken Roboter. Yesterday her voice sounded pretty natural and all that. (Apple translator). But now you can barely understand her. Restarted my phone, reinstall translator app, updated the phone. What else can I do?"
"They already have English, Irish, and Australian. How did Scottish not make the most recent cut?"
"This was definitely one of the things Siri could do early on, I made reservations using only Siri several times, but now when I try to do it all I get are generic Maps results.  Anyone know what the magic incantation is these days to book a table at a restaurant?  I'm assuming it requires a third party app like OpenTable or Yelp but I have OT installed and still can't get it to work."
Siri only indicates ‚Äúadded to shopping list‚Äù.  Is there anyway to have the item repeated for confirmation?  I know Alexa does this.
Are we all using the beta version of iOS or what? Why does Siri suck (more) all the sudden?
Hi I have LGb9 tv and would like to be able to turn off the screen with siri. (Only screen not tv for listening to Spotify)Is it possible?  I can turn off Tv because i am using Broadlink remote however broadlink standard remote do not have this button. Also to do it with standard lg remote we have to press multiple buttons. We can say ‚Äúturn off the screen‚Äù but it works with the remote‚Äùs microphone i i would like to use Siri to turn it off
"After EVERY update on my iPhone, Apple BEGS me to turn on the always listening Siri thing. I have the option to either ""turn on now"" or ""setup later in settings"", in a very [DarkPattern](https://www.darkpatterns.org/)-like way of making the ""setup later in settings"" text smaller, but also not giving me a ""setup never ever ever ever ever ever"" option.  Once I swipe it away, I'm greeted with a red 1 on Settings, and I have to repeat the steps above.  THEN I also have to reenable dictation on my keyboard.  I get that this isn't the worst thing in the world, far from it. But this seems like it must be deliberate on Apple's part. Does anyone else have this issue? Why would ""No, I don't want Siri listening all the time"" turn off dictation if it wasn't intentional?  /Rant"
"Siri's response to ""What is 0√∑0?"" recently changed.  Old response:    ‚ÄúImagine that you have zero cookies and you split them evenly among zero friends. How many cookies does each person get?

And Cookie Monster is sad that there are no cookies, and you are sad that you have no friends.‚Äù  New Response:  ""Imagine that you have zero cookies and you split them evenly among zero friends. How many cookies does each person get? See? It doesn‚Äôt make sense. And Cookie Monster is sad that there are no cookies, **and your friends are sad because they don't exist. Oh wow this escalated quickly**"""

"Satechi has recently released a pair of new Bluetooth Siri-enabled remotes to control presentations as well as media playback on both Mac and iPad: [Satechi releases pair of Bluetooth remotes for Mac &amp; iPad](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/18/satechi-releases-pair-of-bluetooth-remotes-for-mac-ipad)  &amp;#x200B;  [R1 &amp; R2 Remotes](https://preview.redd.it/ymjohm2l0mm61.jpg?width=1320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f05ba124760464d155ca7ca77a2e112543d5487a)  The R1 offers forward and back control buttons, a quick-access keyboard button, and a black-out screen feature. It also has an integrated laser pointing for highlighting on-screen components. It is geared toward adjusting music playback, calling upon Siri, and other media-related tasks.  The R2 remote has additional controls such as multimedia mode to control volume, skip/previous, play/pause, home/Siri, mute, and keyboard. In presentation mode, you have four-way arrows, left/right mouse buttons, and an on-screen laser pointer for use with Keynote and PowerPoint.

hi guys so when i tell siri ‚Äúgo back‚Äù or ‚Äúrestart‚Äù or something she always hears ‚Äúcall _____‚Äù then she starts to call people and it‚Äôs so annoying because i can‚Äôt stop it before she calls. so my question is is there a way for siri to ask you ‚Äúare you sure you want to call ____‚Äù then i could say no instead of her going ahead and doing it. i‚Äôve looked in settings and there‚Äôs no setting for it
Example:  I give Siri the command and she gives me one of her having trouble responses.  I immediately open Homekit and see that the command was executed or ... that I can easily execute it with a press.  Isn't Siri executing the command thru Homekit?
No Siri I mean mom. She only started doing that recently. And helpful advice?
"Hi friends!  Years ago (in 2016 maybe?) I would wish Siri a good night before going to bed. Quite often, she would read me the Goodnight Moon poem (inspired by the book) that includes the following phrases: ‚Äúgoodnight moon‚Äù, ‚Äúgoodnight balloon‚Äù, ‚Äúgoodnight room‚Äù, etc. I haven‚Äôt been able to get her to do it in a long time but I remember it making me really happy and would love to hear it again :( I remember it happening every once in a while, as her answers are randomised, so I‚Äôd have to ask a few times.  I can‚Äôt find a video of it online but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve seen one at some point.  Thanks in advance :)  Edit: I found a [screenshot](https://aminoapps.com/c/virtual-space/page/blog/goodnight-siri/w7Io_uWEz52Jkbx1jZVl37bNejg3q6 ) online, so that‚Äôs proof I didn‚Äôt make it all up."
"My dads trying to use siri on his iPhone XR but the search results don‚Äôt appear even though Siri still says ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what I found.‚Äù I have the same iPhone as him and compared the settings because mine works, but nothings different. Any reason for this happening?"
"Hello,  I've been waiting for a while now to get my hands on a HomePod mini (they're not sold in Norway and thus hard to get). I want to get one solely for the purpose of using Hey Siri to control my home. However, I recently remembered that most iPads and iPhones support Hey Siri while plugged into power. I tried it on an old iPad 4 I had lying around and it worked! Only problem being that it is incredibly slow, to the point where I find it to be unreliable.   So, rather than paying a ridiculous premium to get my hands on a HomePod mini right now (they sell for around $230 used in Norway) I'm considering just getting a used iPad or iPhone and hide it in a bookshelf. However, does anyone have experience with what device is the cheapest one I can get my hands on that has a reliable and responsive Hey Siri? And how the ability to pick up the voice is compared to a HomePod? I've heard that the original HomePod has a very impressive range, something that is absolutely not the case for my iPad 4.  Also, I know that while the HomePod mini supports multiple voices an iPad or iPhone only supports one. So, if I were to hide two devices in my bookshelf (each configured for mine and my wife's voice), has anyone tested if that works or do they just confuse one another?"
"Idk if this is a new function but when I call Siri, I don‚Äôt receive back the ‚Äúhmm hmm‚Äù or ‚Äúah ah‚Äù   I need to turn off the iPhone to make it possible again.   You‚Äôre wondering ‚Äúwhy you need that?‚Äù Only cause when Siri confirms with a sound then I know I can talk even if I‚Äôm in the shower üöø   Anyway, there‚Äôs a solution?  Hey Siri and all other things are already enabled"
"I have someone in my contacts who‚Äôs name is pronounced Becca but spelt Beka, because of this I can‚Äôt use Siri to text or call them. Can I fix this?"
"I wrote the following in the linked thread back on Nov 10, 2020. The struck out part has been restored to normal as of a couple of days ago, but the second problem persists. Come on, Apple.  ~~Used to be, if it was 2 PM, I could  say, ""Wake me up at 3,"" and Siri would set it for 3 PM. Now, Siri sets  it for 3 AM the next day.~~  Now,  when I ask Siri, ""What time is my alarm,"" she replies, ""You alarm is set  for tomorrow at midnight,"" but I have no active alarm at that time.

"Hi folks,  I have some shortcuts setup for AirBnb guests. They have multiple ways they can control them (Remote for Philips Hue, for example). I also have a robot vacuum, thermostat and smart lock. The easiest way for guests to control everything is through Siri on the iPad.  The obvious problem here is that Siri doesn't recognize new voices so it doesn't always work smoothly for the guests. I've tried the Toggle On, Toggle Off but then it always sends me back through setup.     Wondering if there's some sort of workaround for this so that Siri on this specific iPad can recognize all voices?"
"I am using iPhone 11 iOS 14.4 and after updating my system, Siri started to act weird. While I was listening music I called her with ""Hey Siri"" she responded ""MPR=72?"" just like that and then I continued for example ""Call my Mom"" she made me wait for 20 seconds tried over and over again then said "" There's no one registered name Mom "" tried several time with different person names but it just doesn't work. Asked her the weather like very simple commands she is trying to process then fails immediately. Found some weird reports recently about this situation I guess I am not the only one who having problems with Siri nowadays, I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this situation?"
"I have a tech question in regards to Siri no longer making a sound when activated.  Starting the past few days Siri no longer makes a sound when it activates, which makes it awkward to use if I‚Äôm not looking directly at my screen to see if the icon pops up.  When I hold down the button at the top of my iPad the icon pops up but there‚Äôs no activation chime sound. When I use ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù either with or without my Bluetooth headphones there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù or ‚ÄúUh huh?‚Äù indicating it‚Äôs active and listening. This really makes it awkward to use since I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs activated or not without looking at the screen and I‚Äôm wondering is this a glitch or is there some setting somewhere that might be causing this or is this typically what is supposed to happen after using Hey Siri for a few weeks? It‚Äôs seems to have started after I used Hey Siri while listening to music with Bluetooth headphones. Thank you."
"First is how do I make Siri read the weather forecast, everything I can find only brings my phone to the weather app instead of having Siri read it so how can I do that?  My second question, is there a way to make it so my music doesn‚Äôt pause when Siri is talking? I have a song playing in the background and the way it is now is fine but I would like it more if the music only turned down a bit or just continued playing"
"iOS Siri, HomePod Siri, CarPlay Siri, macOS Siri all sound slightly different all have different capabilities some are dumber than others although, all are dumb as a bag of rocks. WTF, Apple?"
3 questions  1) How can I change the Balance (L/R audio balance under accessability settings) using Siri  2) How do I stop siri showing me web search results for questions  3) How do I get siri to goto a website or webpage in my browser
"*^(hey Siri, turn on the flashlight)*  # IT'S ON!"
"Hi guys! I used to enjoy the ‚ÄúHey Siri, do I have any nee notifications?‚Äù And have Siri read them all to me through the airpod. Now, whenever I ask Siri to do so he says (it‚Äôs a He for me üòÑ) : ‚Äúyou need to unlock your iPhone first‚Äù. Well if I want to go unlock my iphone I won‚Äôt need Siri to read them to me anymore! üòÑ Any idea how i can fix this? Thanks üíï"
"This has me a little freaked out, I won't lie. For the first time just ten minutes ago, I was watching a YouTube video and someone said something that sounded similar to ""Siri"", and it activated Siri on my MacBook. The thing is, this has never happened before: I didn't think internal computer audio could trigger Siri, much less when it's going through AirPods. What is going on here? Am I wrong that this is abnormal? I replayed that part of the video several times and I can confirm that it's the video activating Siri."
"My girlfriends alarm was going off on her iPhone (we aren‚Äôt connected with accounts in any way) and I said ‚ÄúHey Siri, Turn off alarm‚Äù as a joke and my phone‚Äôs Siri responded that is turned off a nearby devices alarm. I can‚Äôt find anything online about this feature, but that doesn‚Äôt seem right."
"I've been playing around with Siri, and I actually don't know a lot of the features with the latest iOS release so I just wanted to ask what are some of your favorite Siri features and what are some things you would like to see Apple tackle in the next iOS release?"
So I‚Äôm trying to show my neighbor how to use hands free in his car to make a call. He has a Sony aftermarket radio and when you press the microphone to say who you want to call and it will say ‚Äúcalling‚Äù but looking at the phone it pops up their number at the bottom and you have to press it on the phone before it actually calls which defeats the whole purpose of hands free. Is there anyway to make it automatically call without having to press it on the phone as well?
"I‚Äôm currently using iPhone and iPad, most irritating problem I encounter is that when I call Siri, it‚Äôs always wrong device responding. I keep my phone away from my study table.  Only if they add such feature to rename assistant on different devices, it would help correct device to respond.  Do tell if there is a already existing solution to this problem."
"Can anyone please provide me with some information about using the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù feature? I realize Apple uses some pretty impressive technology when it comes to keeping your privacy, like how Touch ID works. But I can‚Äôt seem to find much about how ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù works. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
"Hey folks.  In previous versions of iOS, you could add a custom phrase to a shortcut by tapping ‚ÄúAdd to Siri‚Äù, from the details menu if I remember correctly. I can‚Äôt seem to find the option now on iOS 14. I know that you can say ‚ÄúHey Siri, [shortcut name]‚Äù, but I think it would be better with a custom phrase.  Thanks in advance."
"""Hey Siri, play the song 'Summer Girl'""  This is a song that's  in my library. It's been played by me many times. So why did Siri give me a different song called ""Summer Girl"" by a band that I've never ever listened to?  ""Hey Siri, play 'Rikki Don't Lose That Number'""  This is a Steely Dan song that's in my library. I've listened to it a lot. I have a ton of Steely Dan in my library. So why did Siri give me a COVER VERSION of the song by a band that I've never listened to? Putting aside that it's a song that's in my library, I'm assuming that the original version is way more popular than some obscure cover - why would the latter be the first choice for Siri to cue up?  Anyone else find that Siri isn't so swift when it comes to giving you the most logical result?"
"Below are a few use cases where Siri is in my opinion - just stupid. What is worse, the assistant seems not to be able to do things it used to do before just fine. Besides having a laugh, any input is welcome (for example if I missed something that needs to be allowed in the settings, or if another command works for you)  Battery status: in the past I was able to ask Siri about battery status on different devices I own, the command ‚Äúhow‚Äôs the battery on the/my watch/AirPods/phone‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the status of the battery on the/my watch/AirPods/phone‚Äù worked just fine. Every now and then I even got a funny answer like ‚Äúit‚Äôs at 100%. Overachiever.‚Äù (this one I really find funny). Now, Siri points me to apple.com for info about battery stats for different products, that is for both iterations of the question, even if I‚Äôm careful to say ‚Äúmy‚Äù instead of ‚Äúthe‚Äù.  Calling people: my wife is ethnically Chinese and has a Chinese name - and since long time ago this is how I have her listed in my contacts. But because if Siri, I set her ‚Äúphonetic first name‚Äù to what she has on her passport (corresponds to the two characters of her given name), ‚Äúlearned‚Äù how to pronounce this ‚Äúas if‚Äù in English and used to call her via Siri (again!) just fine - until recently when Siri decided to stop comprehending that name (every time says things like ‚Äúcould you say that again‚Äù ‚Äúwhom should I call‚Äù ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get that‚Äù, or the like). The dumbest thing is that when I tell Siri to redial my last call, she does that and says her name in exactly the same way I tried few seconds before but to no avail - how on earth is it not working when I say that? +btw I‚Äôve seen people on YouTube videos say ‚ÄúHey Siri, pick up/hang up‚Äù, this never worked for me, no idea why.  Forwarding: Siri apparently can‚Äôt forward a command back to phone, even if explicitly told to do so. HomePod overtakes any command when it can hear me (and gosh it can hear me even when whispering! talking about the mini) but if it‚Äôs something that can be done only on phone (e.g. turning off the flashlight), Siri will just say ‚Äúsorry can‚Äôt do it here‚Äù. But even if I try and ask to turn off the flashlight ‚Äúon the phone‚Äù, the assistant refuses. I guess this is deemed to be a security thing but common - can‚Äôt even turn off the flashlight? (If you wonder about the use case: since covid, when I come back home I try not to touch stuff including light switches before washing my hands, don‚Äôt own any smart home appliances, but since I have rash/allergies I try limiting using hot water/soap, so before I wash hands I try to take out and sort all things that need to be sanitized with wipes - usually put them on the floor, put away ‚Äúdirty‚Äù shoes and coat, and during this time the flashlight is on so that I can see things, the ‚Äúdirty‚Äù phone rests against the wall, and after I wash my hands, if I‚Äôm not yet ready to wipe the phone and want to do other things first, I‚Äôd like to turn the flashlight off without touching it just yet...well turns out I can‚Äôt)  Currency conversion on HomePod: this is resolved already but for some time conversion (data from yahoo.com) worked only on the phone but Siri refused to do this on the HomePod - no idea why, luckily it works now  Can‚Äôt do AND logic: this is my longstanding complaint, if two commands are not contradictory and indeed can be carried out one by one in the order that the user said them (connected with AND), the assistant should be able to carry these out in sequence. (the use case: I like to take long walks, even in winter with a cap over my head and thick gloves on my hands. But before I leave home, I‚Äôd like to say ‚Äúbye‚Äù on transparency, and after closing the door I‚Äôd like to say ‚Äúturn on noise cancellation AND continue playback/playing podcasts/music‚Äù, well, I have to call ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù twice in a row, which makes me feel like an idiot)"
how do we pump siri??

"Hi guys,  Been having this issue a while now. Whenever I ask Siri to call a contact called Ashlee, it always says ‚Äúdid you mean Ashlee?‚Äù. Every time!   It used to be fine but it changed a few weeks back and I can‚Äôt understand why. I‚Äôm saying the name as clearly as I can.   Have anyone else had this issue?  All help appreciated!"
"It used work if I remember correctly.  The issue is when I ask ""Hey, Siri, call my wife"" Siri says who is your wife. so I name ABC, then Siri says ok, I will remember ABC as your wife. Then I ask ""hey, Siri, call my wife"" right after, sometimes it will call her. but later, or next day, when I ask same phrase, it's back to one. asking me who is my wife.  I put my wife info as my spouse in my contact and I even see her name registered as wife as well.  Has there been a change?"
"Hi All,    I have multiple versions of the same song downloaded to my iPhone.  Some of these alternate versions are acoustic, some live, etc.  I have the songs differentiated by the title, e.g., Ants Marching vs Ants Marching (acoustic).  Previously, I was able to say, ""Hey Siri, play Ant's Marching Acoustic"" and it would play the correct one.  Now despite the fact that Siri is hearing and correctly interpreting ""acoustic"", it plays the non-acoustic one.  This has only been happening in the last few weeks and I haven't changed anything in my library.  Any thoughts or workarounds for this so I can get it to play the right version (without naming the songs in my library and realizing a lot of these acoustic or live versions don't have album information associated with them.)  Thanks!"
"After 2 days of my new iPhone I now saw, that Siri uses Google as her Search Engine for Results.   Am I able to change that? I don't want her to use Google. Why can't she use DuckDuckGo etc. instead?   Afai looked I didn't found a solution in Settings."
Can i add custom commands to siri? Ex: hey siri undo  (Undo last action)
"Hi I was wondering if there was a way to say ""hey siri, play music"" and then have siri execute this command: ""shuffle my liked songs playlist on spotify"". Its such a pain to say that every time I wanna shuffle my music and would be nice if I can alias that command. I know Alexa has this feature does Siri?"
"I have an an automation set to turn off the light and turn on the fan if I say ‚ÄúHey Siri good night‚Äù she used to never give voice feedback when given this command, but has recently started replying with ‚ÄúThe scene is set. Good night.‚Äù Is there any way to turn this response off? It‚Äôs really annoying to have her respond, especially if the volume of HomePod was left on a loud setting."

"Sorry if this question has been posed before. I see others posting screenshots where Siri is compact and just a circle at the bottom. When I activate Siri using Hey Siri or the side button on my phone, it‚Äôs the older style where it takes up my entire screen. What am I doing wrong? A setting I have messed up?  In USA here. Using iPhone 12 Pro Max on iOS 14.3."
"Hey everyone, newbie here. I am native French speaker &amp; I would like to know how to activate Siri in your languages/Country ?   In French, we say ¬´¬†Dis Siri¬†...¬ª which can be translate by ¬´¬†Tell me Siri ...¬†¬ª  Have a good day"
"I've tried searching for this but haven't had much luck.  When I try to use the share button in an app (safari, photos, reddit), Siri is recommending my contacts to send a message using the message app.  For some of the contacts, when I click the siri suggestion to send a message to them user, it is defaulting to sending a message as an SMS message (dreaded green text).  I have to delete their name from the address bar and retype their name and only then does it come up as an iMessage user.  These users are using iPhones and I have been sending messages using iMessage forever.  Does anyone know how to fix this bug?"
"Is there any way to ask my phone how much time is left on the timer I set on my homepod in the kitchen?  Everything I tried so far (""How much time is left on the kitchen timer"", ""how much time is left on my homepod timer"", ""do I have any timers running"", etc) hadn't worked."
Does anyone else have a problem using ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù? I feel like it only recognizes my voice like 50% of the time. I use an iPhone 11
"When you ask Siri for your update, is there a way to modify the information??"
"Maybe I‚Äôm running, maybe I‚Äôm washing dishes: but the goes off with a persistent chime in my ear. I want to make it stop using Siri, but can‚Äôt.  I‚Äôve tried saying things like ‚Äúhey Siri shut up‚Äù ‚Äúhey Siri I got it‚Äù but after a vapid dialogue with Siri, the alarm continues. I think this is a new bug since the iOS 14 update.   If you have a simple way to tell Siri to make the timer stop ringing, you can make my every say .05% better."
If I say ‚Äúhello all caps my name is John all caps off‚Äù.    The sentence reads hello MY NAME IS JOHN OFF
"Siri will puse after receiving a command. I will say ‚ÄúHey Siri, play previous track.‚Äù And Siri says ‚ÄúOkay, going back.‚Äù and then doesn‚Äôt actually go back.. it gets stuck on this part. The little Siri color thing just keeps spinning, but it doesn‚Äôt do the actual command. Siri will hear and respond to my commands, but then gets stuck ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù it??"
"In my HomeKit home, I‚Äôve invited people (my spouse) and when they use Siri to control my home, she tells them ‚Äúsetting the scene.‚Äù If the same command is given to Siri three or more times, she might execute some or all of the automation(s).

How can I increase stability for users?"
"My Siri devices no longer react correctly to ""Change the Bedroom (or any room) to red/white/whatever color"" and instead gives me a response of ""Sorry I couldn't find anything like that for your Bedroom"" or something like that.  This is basically a regression of something Siri has been doing in my home for ages, so does anyone know why this might have changed or have dealt with this themselves?   Thanks in advance."
"I activated Siri to use it when I drive my car. But before I can interact, for example ‚Äúsend a message to X via Y‚Äù the phone needs to be unlocked. To unlock it I have to take it in my hand which is forbidden where I live.   So far, I have not found a solution.

"For a while now, Siri responds way too slow or just fails to respond at all while connected to Wi-Fi. However, I can turn it off and she's lightening fast. It's definitely not my wifi too because I can't replicate the issue anywhere else and I've tested my speed every single time and its over 200 mb. Has anyone else encountered this issue?"
"There is a distinct difference between apologising and saying/being sorry.  Siri is a artificial intelligence, should Siri feel, the it can be sorry, but if it can‚Äôt, it inevitably is manipulating societies into Apple‚Äôs standards of social etiquette."
i keep on aaying hey siri to siri but it keeps on saying that ‚Äú siri didnt quite get that by the way ive got an iphone 12 if you was wondering please let me know beacuse ive been up from 7am trying to get thus to work and im about to give up so please.
"Hi, sorry if this has already been posted a million times but idk what to search. I‚Äôm doing a shortcut to make mono audio turn on (so I don‚Äôt lose sound when I‚Äôm listening with one headphone).

"Without fail, Siri will stop responding to ""Hey, Siri"" after my shower, and I cannot imagine why.  I have tested this by asking Siri for the time hands-free before getting into the shower, which works, and then doing so afterwards, which doesn't (or for that matter, any request).   Once I manually trigger Siri by holding the side button, it will respond to ""Hey, Siri"" again, but hey, I'm dripping wet wrapped up in a towel, I don't want to touch my phone just yet, this is when hands-free should work!  Is it a temperature thing? Humidity? Did all the water/fan sounds put it into some mode I don't know about? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  iPhone 12 Pro, iOS 14.3"
"hello!  i am new to the iphone (from android) and loving it. a weird thing i noticed though is that when i asked siri to call a restaurant (which it does recognize the name of), it said it‚Äôs not in my contacts. so i added it to my contacts and then of course it worked... but is it not possible to just have siri call a business that is not in your contacts? google assistant can do it."
It‚Äôs extremely annoying when your just trying to get directions to a place of business from Siri really quickly and your having to wait forever while she goes on a whole spiel about the store! If I wanted to know that information I‚Äôd look it up my damn self. I don‚Äôt need her dictating out a bunch of info I don‚Äôt need or want when I‚Äôm just trying to get directions real quick!
"I‚Äôve had a look around the settings, however is there any-other way to get Siri attention, instead of saying ‚Äò‚Äôhey‚Äô‚Äô beforehand?"
"So I was just sitting here watching an MKBHD video about the new HomePod Mini on my iPhone, and at one point he said ‚ÄúHey, Siri‚Äù, to which my iPad responded with the little Siri icon.   However, the icon went away immediately, even though it heard the magic phrase, so I thought that maybe Siri has gotten an update to block out unknown voices in iOS/iPadOS?  Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but it literally went away as fast as it appeared. No ‚Äúhmm?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan you say that again?‚Äù type of thing from Siri or anything."
I was speaking to my mates about how stupid it is that the iPhone 12 doesn‚Äôt come with a plug and I said other stuff about the aux port and that its sh*t that they are taking stuff away and charging the same.And out of no where Siri says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not nice‚Äù I didn‚Äôt activate it and it was atleast 2 foot away from me .....: Explanation????
"I wish it could make communicating with people easier, how about you?"
"Sadly I don‚Äôt have video evidence of this and it‚Äôs the first time i‚Äôve ever seen it happen. Hopefully I‚Äôm not losing it in the head.  I asked my HomePod for the hours of a business here in Austin. I said: ‚ÄúHey Siri, when does East Austin Succulents close?‚Äù When i said that i did get a little held up on the word ‚ÄúAustin‚Äù because it‚Äôs been a crazy day and i‚Äôm tired. She responded: ‚ÄúEast Austs... Sorry. I‚Äôll try again. East Austin Succulents closes at...‚Äù  Either it‚Äôs completely random to make her sound more human, or Apple has taught her to stutter when she hears a user stutter. I am not sure though as it just happened for the first time.  For reference the stuttering Siri is on a HomePod MQHV2LL/A with OS version 14.3.  I‚Äôm posting here to share my odd experience.

"Hi there,  Is anyone of you aware of how to do the following with Siri?  * Ask the title of the active tab in Safari * Ask the name of the active application * Have Siri say ‚Äòdone‚Äô when it completes a command successfully  When I am not looking at the screen for some reason, I would know those things.  Thanks."
"Is there any way to adjust the way that Siri pronounces playlist names? I have a playlist called ‚ÄòGenerica‚Äô and when I ask Siri to play it, she know which one I mean but she always replied ‚ÄòPlaying ‚ÄòJen-reeka‚Äô. It‚Äôs definitely not a serious issue but this sort of stuff does grind my gears. Is there any way to adjust her pronounciation?"
"In the podcasts app I have 3 personal stations set up. ""Daily Podcasts"", ""Unlistened Podcasts"" and ""Sport Podcasts"". when I ask siri to play Daily Podcasts or Station Daily Podcasts, it loads some podcast called ""Daily"" or something it calls ""the daily podcasts"" both of which have absolutely nothing to do with any of my podcast subscriptions, or it insists on playing a match from music.   Is there a way I can use Siri to call up the stations I set up in the podcast app, or do I forever have to do that manually?   It's OK when I can interact with my iPhone or iPad, but I want to be able to play these from a homepod with my phone/tablet in another room, or in my car while driving."
"I have only one shortcut set up on my phone. It's an extremely simple shortcut. All it does is launch Pocket Casts and tells it to resume playback. That's it.  Prior to the latest version of iOS, it worked every single time and I was quite happy, because I was tired of iOS always shutting down every app after like 5 minutes, and when I hit play it would start something I was listening to on Apple Music three weeks ago.  ANYways... now, almost every single time I tell Siri my ""play podcast"" shortcut, it comes back and asks me to confirm it. It does this on the phone and watch. It's really annoying and really makes it NOT a shortcut anymore.  Is there a way to stop this?"
"I'm having a weird problem that seems to be new in the latest version of iOS.  Here's a scenario I find myself in often. I want to set an alarm for later that day to remind me to do something (because I don't find actual reminders to be alerting enough). So lets say it's 10am. I say ""Siri, set an alarm for 2 to call Sam."" Siri would then set my alarm for 2PM that day. Cool.  But now, the exact same scenario will set an alarm for 2am.  Why? I recognize that I can say ""2pm,"" but sometimes I forget. It seems to me that if they're trying to add more artificial intelligence into Siri, making it assume that I want an alarm to go off at 2am isn't very intelligent.  So what's the deal? Is this new?"
Tuesday morning I asked Siri to set a 10:30pm alarm for Thursday. She claimed she can‚Äôt make an alarm for more than a day ahead.   But..... Asking Siri to set an alarm for 10:30pm every Thursday works?  What the heck? Guess I‚Äôll just have to remember to go in and turn it off or delete it after the alarm goes off.
"I am having an issue with the announce messages feature. I have an iPhone SE 2020 running 14.2, an Apple Watch running watchOS 7, and gen 2 AirPods.

"Hey,  I‚Äôve been having this issue lately and can‚Äôt figure out how to solve it.   Since the ios14 update, when I ask Siri on my AirPods to switch songs, pause, tell me the time, weather, etc etc it will stay open on my lock screen. Then it starts to drain my battery.

"So I'm trying to get Siri to pronounce a contact's name right when reading off texts.  Siri: ""From ""contact name"" \*reads message\*""  While teaching it, it took a couple tries to get the right option, but eventually got it and it told me it learned how to pronounce the name. It still can't get it right though when reading messages to me (uses original, wrong, pronunciation). I added the phonetic spelling in the contacts too but nothing.   Any suggestions?   Thanks"
"Ive been dealing with this for a long time and cant fix it. Voice memos hears me perfectly, but siri can't.

Also, when I hold down the power button to activate siri, it can hear me like 1/20 times. Its extremely frustrating. Any ideas?"

I know I can say ‚ÄúSet an alarm for 2pm‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äúpm‚Äù every day. Is there a way to change Siri to set my alarms at the correct time?"
"For example ask her to read the phrases ‚Äúhis intimacy‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to fulfill‚Äù. Even though Siri certainly know how to pronounce words ‚Äúintimacy‚Äù and ‚Äúfulfill‚Äù correctly on their own, it consistently mispronounces them in context. And this is not just about these two words ‚Äî if you use the iOS text-to-speech functions regularly, you know that these errors happen all the time (maybe once a minute).

It's happening with HomePod, apple watches, and iPhones.  It's also happening to everyone in the house.  Lights are often unreachable or not responding in the home app.  Sometimes, it will work the first time but Siri will apologize that she couldn't reach the device."

"I use Siri in French and this problem doesn't seem to happen in English. But my main (only...) use of Siri is to set alarms. I always used to say (in French) ""*Alarm at 10:30*"" and the alarm was set.  Now whenever I say this, Siri answers ""*There is no alarm at 10:30*"" or, if I had set an old alarm at this time, it just gives me a status on it ""*This alarm is currently deactivated*"".  To set an alarm I now have to say ""*Set alarm at 10:30*"" which doesn't seem like a big deal but is getting extremely bugging on a daily basis, as I use a lot of alarms every day for my work.

"Hello all,  I just wanted to know if Apple have stopped investing in Siri? I'm in the process of transitioning my home to a ""smart home"". I had hoped to use Siri and  Homekit as the central hub for this as I am otherwise plugged into the Apple ecosystem anyway.  However, unless I'm doing something wrong, it really can't compete with Google Home or Alexa. I refer specifically to Siri and NLP capabilities. It mostly isn't able to action more than basic commands such as telling me what the weather is or converting measurements, etc. Followup questions don't seem to work, i.e. you have to say Hey Siri again. For a lot of basic and more complex tasks, it simply asks you to unlock your iphone or it points you to a website which isn't helpful for a handsfree experience. It doesn't seem to be able to control my Sonos system, there's no comparable product to the Google Next hubs or the Echos.  Given how far advanced the others are, and how much time Apple have had to improve, I'm reluctant to invest in an Apple setup if they've simply stopped supporting / investing in it.  Any ideas?  Deepesh  &amp;#x200B;  PS On a positive side, the Home app is pretty good actually. It's more robust than the others."
"So I found something very interesting today. I was checking how much a subscription would cost me per year if I choose the monthly option, and I asked Siri how much that would be. To my absolute surprise, apparently Siri (or Wolfram Alpha) does not understand what euros are, or well non-dollar currencies actually. Every time you ask for a calculation with some currency, it opts for ""Okay, here's what I found on the web"". But if you decide to make it dollars, then all of a sudden the Wolfram Alpha plugin (software? idk) comes up and gives you a calculation. Has anyone else had this issue? Tbh its kinda astounding to me that Siri can't handle other currencies apparently. Has anyone found a way (barring ofc just to say numbers without currencies, i just said the currency without really thinking about it the first time around) to counteract this?"

"Hello  I asked Siri the definition of Nile so I can get the length of th eNile River, but it keeps giving me the etymology of the Catalan name Niall, which isn't even pronounced like Nile is.  I know this because my next door neighbour is form catalonia and the all in Niall is pronounced like the word all.  I don't have Niall in my contacts under the name Niall as I call him by a nickname that sounds nothing like Niall.  So why does Siri keep switching ""Nile"" to ""Niall"" when I say ""definition of Nile?""  I know that there's a famous singer name dNiall (odd that an Irish guy has a Catalan first name but anyway) again, Nile and Niall are not pronounced the same way.  How do I get Siri to not hear ""definition of Nile"" as ""Definition of Niall?""  I don't want Niall, I know it's a Catalan name, I want it to talk about the Nile River.  I use Siri when my hands are wet or busy doing things like cooking, so I can't just waltz over to my phone and use my hands to type.  I also do not have a U.S. or standard UK accent as i am Singaporean, though I do live in the UK.  I'm careful to say ""nile"" not ""Niall"" but I guess Siri has a thing for Catalan men?"

Sometimes sporadically throughout the day my Hey Siri won‚Äôt activate and it seems to be at the times when I really need to use it.

Not sure if this is a common issue but I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing this and/or knew of a way to fix this. I‚Äôve tried restarting my phone and redoing the Hey Siri setup prompts.

"Hello,  Is there any way to use Siri to read the website content without activating the accessibility feature? Currently I am getting only ""there is nothing to read"" if I ask Siri to read me the website. What can be the reason? The answer is somewhat unclear."
What are your thoughts on the answer?
"I don't need Siri to tell me ""OK, DAN, THE LIGHT ARE OFF"" when I am standing under them. I know if I use Siri without ""Hey Siri,"" such as on my iPhone, there is no verbal confirmation  (I have found this option in the settings), but when will saying ""Hey Siri"" not invoke a confirming response? Ideally Siri would know where I am in the home and confirm if the command is in another location, but that's a pipe dream.  I bring it up because the other day after I updated to 14.2 I had asked for lights to turn off and Siri did it without telling me anything, and I immediately noticed and thought it was a new feature. But here I am today and I told her ""turn on the downstairs lights"" and she said literally: ""ok the light are on."" I don't have the British Siri so I was shocked to hear her use this grammar.   I wish we just had the option to not have Siri yell back at me when I tell her to do something. The completed action is suffice."

Also if I'm mainly connected to my phone, I won't hear the AW Siri replies in my airpods,which could've been handy...  Another thing that keeps bothering me is when I use the AW to control the volume from my phone to my airpods, it takes a while of scrolling with the crown for it to actually connect and change volume."

"Recently, that is since updating to iOS 14 on my iPhone 11 Pro, Siri has been behaving inconsistently and unreliably, and I'm wondering if this has been an experience among others.  I basically only do two things on Siri: start timers, and control HomeKit items. For context on the HomeKit items, they never show any latency in responding to control actions when I control them in the Home app, so HomeKit is not imparting any latency. When Siri works properly, both of these types of requests seem to resolve almost immediately.  These are the two types of issues I've frequently encountered:  * **Going AWOL**: When I invoke Siri on my iPhone by holding the Side Button, and say ""set a timer for five minutes,"" the Siri icon will simply disappear from the screen, without response, and a timer will not be set. This is particularly troublesome because I have no indication it failed until I find no timer was set. * **Hanging, absent connection issues**: When I invoke Siri in the same way and either set a timer or say, e.g., ""turn on the chandelier,"" Siri will hang for a while, displaying generic waiting messages like ""Hold on..."" or ""On it..."" or ""Just a second..."" and then, after a long wait, fail with a generic error message.  I have witnessed this for at least the past couple weeks, while at home, standing directly under a high power AP in my kitchen, with what I believe to be a high-speed, low-latency, stable connection to the internet. I know there were purported issues with Ubiquiti APs very recently patched, but I've seen the issue after that patch, so I see no correlation.  For one, has anyone else had these Siri inconsistency issues, and second, is there any fix or mitigation to these issues? For some odd reason, starting and then stopping Airplane Mode seems to reliably fix the random latency issue, but that's not a long-term solution."

A while back, I changed from Samsung to Apple so I could access iTunes on my phone and listen to my music while I was out driving. However, if I say ""Hey Siri, take a picture."" it just opens the camera app and does nothing else.  Is there any way to actually make Siri... well... actually *take a picture*?"

"I don't know if this is across all devices as I own an android phone, and have an iPad.   Siri keeps responding to me trying to talk to Google Assistant. Seems kind of funny, but is there any way to turn it off?"
"Do somebody know if this feature works with third-party apps like WhatsApp or Telegram? If so, how can I turn it on?"
What is the reasoning behind preventing this?  Surely it‚Äôs easy enough to enable.
"Me and my gf tried it on our macs and phones, Siri will process the word ""clam"" as ""klamm"" every single time. Kinda weird, not like clam is an uncommon word."
"When I use Siri to call someone, it mentions the device my contact is associated with.   For example, I go ""Siri, call X"" and it goes""Calling X. Mobile"" can I stop her saying Mobile everytime?"
"With ''hey siri function''     with the new Home mini Arriving next month. Is it possible to send every text spoken to siri with the homepod ip/name/or wtv , as a string and a variable respectively ( i am think about using shorcut with ssh wich is pretty easy to send an ip as a variable ...but not sure aboout the text spoken using siri.         that would allow room awareness .      I am already doing it with iobroker with echo dots. Would be nice to change to homepods"
"They actually managed to make Siri even worse.  There are many times i ask stuff now and nothing happens now. No ‚Äúsorry i didnt catch that‚Äù,  - nothing.   They removed the live speech to text, so i dont know if it understood any part of what i said.   The animation doesnt react according to my voice like before  I long press the button on the side, and the siri icon appears - in the bottom. if it appeared next to the button i just pushed would be more intuitive."
"Apple claims I should be able to tell siri on my phone ""watch \[show\] on appleTV"" and have the TV start playing, but I can't figure this out.  Anybody use this successfully?  [https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT209464](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT209464)  &amp;#x200B;  I recently got an AppleTV 4k after using a FireTV for years.  One if the features I used the most on the FireTV was being able to tell my Echo ""watch \[show\]"" and it would power on my AV system and start playing.  If Siri had this capability, I would probably switch to a homepod, but I can't figure it out.  All that happens when I ask Siri to play a show on ""Living room TV,"" is the TV app opens on the device I am using.  Sometimes I also get ""I can't do that here"" (great error message, team!)  I noticed that the docs say ""connected to wifi,"" does that literally mean wifi or just connected to the same network?  I have ethernet run to my AV stack, I'm not going to downgrade to wifi.  Does this feature just use airplay?  I despise airplay for this use case b/c it consumes battery/resources on my phone, interrupts the stream if I try to watch a short vid on phone, and not every app(youtube) cooperates with the screen locking.  It's also ridiculous to have my iPhoneSE do trasncoding to the more powerful AppleTV."
"Whenever I ask siri to play anything from spotify (I tried both ""play 21 pilots on spotify"" and ""play good songs (a playlist of mine) on spotify"") it just returns saying ""I couldn't find \[insert name\] on spotify"". How do I fix this?"
"I found an old iPhone 4S in a thrift store, but when I turned Siri on It doesn't have a voice. I tried everything to get Siri to have a voice, but I couldn't. Any suggestions?"
"In my country, Apple News is blocked. Now when trying out the new ""What's my update?"" with Siri, it starts to talk about the weather and my next appointment and then it says ""Oh, you need an app for that."" ... but it doesn't say which app or gives a list of compatible apps or anything.  Are there any compatible apps yet?"
"Recently my Siri has been acting slow. I usually use Siri to quickly check on scores and schedules of sports teams I follow. Last week Siri was able to tell me the score of the Dallas Cowboys game against the Cleveland Browns normally, then I asked for the Dodgers schedule and again it worked. That was about four days ago. Now recently I asked for updates on the NBA finals and Siri was slow and didn‚Äôt even say the score it just pulled up Wolfram Alpha data.  I asked for the schedule for the Dodgers again and Siri couldn‚Äôt bring up the same results as before just a wiki article on the team or ESPN articles. I asked for the Dallas Cowboys score for today and Siri took long just to tell me an error occurred. What‚Äôs strange is Siri can still do normal things like check the weather or make calls but with these questions it won‚Äôt work. I did everything I thought I can do to fix it. Reset my wifi connection, rebooted my phone, turned Siri on and off and even deleted the Siri dictation history. Still no luck. The only thing I haven‚Äôt tried is updating from iOS 14 to 14.0.1 because I heard that it‚Äôs super buggy with the widgets. Anybody else deal with this or something similar? TL;DR Siri results don‚Äôt show up like they used to a week ago how do I fix this?"
"Whenever I use Siri on my Mac or HomePod, its a lil bothersome I need to remember to say to shuffle the playlist, otherwise its the same songs in order. Is there any work around to allow me to say ‚ÄúHey Siri, Play [Playlist]‚Äù and she will shuffle automatically?"
I usually use Siri to ask about game scores and times. Today she won‚Äôt return anything more than web search results.   Are sports request still working for anyone else?
"I wanted to make a shortcut that when you double tap on the back that would lock the screen, but I noticed that if you ask Siri to lock the screen she replies that she can‚Äôt  do it. Why so? Is there a way to make this shortcut?"
"Do you want to have an universal remote control that can control all of your appliances from one place a remote that can be integrated with Amazon Echo Device, Google Home, Siri, Node-RED and Home Assistant? I have good news for you there is such device called Broadlink RM4 Pro and I'm about to show it to you in details.   Broadlink RM4 Pro is an amazing device that supports IR and RF and it even can show you the Temperature &amp; Humidity if you buy it with this additional USB cable with these sensors. I will try to integrate Broadlink RM4 Pro with Amazon Echo Device (Alexa), Siri, Node-RED and Home Assistant   And because I'm always try to listen your voice and vote I will make this video in two parts. The first part that means this video will contain the unboxing and pairing process of Broadlink RM4 PRO, adding appliances and integration with Alexa and Siri.   The second part will be entirely about integration with Node-RED and Home Assistant and it will be available next week or right now depending of when exactly you are watching this.   What problem an universal remote like RM4 Pro can solve? Currently to turn on my TV I have to use three remotes. One to just switch on my TV, Second to turn on my Audio Video Receiver, and to select the right HDMI input, and Third to control the channels from my Dreambox STB.

"Announce messages with Siri completely disappeared from my phone. I think it happened when I updated to 14.1  It worked perfectly before, and I had a shortcut in my control center too, but now it has disappeared.  What‚Äôs going on? Did they remove it or what?  For information I have an iPhone 11 and AirPods Pro, so the devices shouldn‚Äôt be an issue."
Say happy birthday to Siri!
"I asked Siri to scare me, and she did. I need to find put if anyone else has experienced this.  I was in bed with my girlfriend last night and like iPhones some times do, her phone must have heard ‚ÄòHey Siri‚Äô from somewhere in our conversation, prompting the Siri jingle to play aloud. This unwarranted response majorly creeped my girlfriend out to my amusement, so I decided to ask Siri to scare me. Her response was something like this:  ‚ÄúWait for it...          wait for it.........           ‚Äú Then she said something that I couldn‚Äôt really understand? (I recently switched to the Indian accent to change things up which might be why) phonetically it sounded like CAH-JU-DATING. Obviously this was just another lacklustre siri joke that barely warranted a chuckle from me. Our conversation then dwindled on for a good while before, seemingly out of the blue, Siri spoke that same word again; ‚ÄúCAH-JU-DATING‚Äù. causing my girlfriend to scream and honestly it caught me off-guard too. I was made to turn off my phone last night and while trying to recreate what happened last night I can‚Äôt? I ask Siri to scare me and the only response I get is ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù Any one else experienced this?"
I want to record my request to Siri and the response in audio and screen. If I use screen recorder with Siri I get the answer recorded (audio adn screen) but not my audio request. If I just just use screen recorder and speak I can play back my audio and the screen.   I cannot find a way to record both my audio request and Siri's response with the screen as well.  Suggestions welcome...
"Anybody get a problem with their battery after updating iOS 14? I noticed that my battery doesn‚Äôt last longer than iOS 13. And last week, the battery percentage of my iPhone 11 dropped to 96% and when I cheched again this morning, it was only 95%. Anybody got the same problem?"
"I noticed Siri is incredibly slow to both receive and respond to my commands since the new update. I now have to wait several seconds before I see any actions, and usually it‚Äôs just easier to do the function by going to whatever app I want to use. Is this a common issue? And if so, are there any fixes?"
I‚Äôm curious: does anyone actually use the Siri suggestions feature?
Now that in iOS14 you can have a type-in Siri wouldn‚Äôt it be useful to have Apple integrating this feature on the Search Widget?
"Siri‚Äôs response volume with hey siri is so low, I almost can‚Äôt hear it when I have my phone right next to me. Any solutions? DND is off and the phone is not on vibrate mode."

But opening an app especially is really slow.   I‚Äôm on iPhone X and it‚Äôs quite sad to know Siri got downgraded.   Also i hate how Siri doesn‚Äôt show me what i just said. I‚Äôm not sure if Siri dictated what i just said correctly when i mutter. Nor can i edit what i just said so that Siri can understand it better. Not gonna lie, the ux has gone worse."

"Hi, random questioner here. My mom says she got a Siri suggestion on her lock screen that simply said ""f\*ck"". She immediately deleted it.  I'm thinking porn site ad? Any other ideas?"
"I‚Äôve enabled Siri, but when I press the home button and Siri pops up, my voice is not listen.   When I try to setup the hey Siri, I can‚Äôt go past the first step, because it does not detect any voice.   I have no problems with audio and other apps. When I call someone they have no issues listen to me.   It only happens with Siri.   Any ideas what might be causing this?"
"I don‚Äôt know if it is just because of iOS 14 now or it was before too but it now helps me with my pre calculus homework too. I just say Hey Siri 7x^2 + 9x - 3 and it actually graphs the question and shows it without taking me to safari and blah blah. So far I haven‚Äôt even used my calculator, I just throw the questions at her and it works 100% of the time."
"If I say ""how many days since 10th feb 2017"" it will instead tell me how many days since 10th feb 2020, despite it correctly understanding the date INCLUDING the year.  What's going wrong here? Is it only me that's having this issue?  iOS 13.5"
"Sorry if this is a dumb question or has already been answered, but whenever I go to use ""Hey Siri"", literally every device tries to respond and the winning device is never the one that I'm trying to use and it drives me absolutely crazy. For example, when I'm on my MacBook, I'd prefer Siri to repsond on the Mac. Is there a way to inhibit my phone/watch/tablet from trying to take the response at certain times and go back to normal after that time?"
"I‚Äôve a problem with siri: Siri can‚Äôt listen me, It listen only with headphones... Anyone have this problem?"

In a perfect world would be nice to have Siri to auto detect the language on the text and read it in the right language. I know that would be hard, specially when the language in text messages are a bit ""broken"", but at least it would be nice to be able to say ""read the last message in Portuguese"", which is not a bad alternative or not that hard to do... specially on the new iOS 14 that already has a translate app that can detect languages..."
"I've set a relationship on contacts.    As I ask siri  ""who it my manager?"", it shows my manager's contacts.  But as I ask siri to call my manager, it ask back to me ""what is your manager's first and last name?"".   How can I call manager using siri? Help me plz"
"Title. When I ask Siri to like a song or add to favourites, there's a response that Spotify doesn't support this action yet. When I ask Siri to name the song, it says the artist-name, but I failed to pick a command to make a note with this info, except for repeating the same things out loud, which isn't ideal. Any way to save cool songs from Spotify for posterity that I don't know of?"

Currently I keep Siri in my native language but this way I can‚Äôt use it in the car for driving directions or to respond or listen to any text messages in English.

Siri was never activated btw."
"This could work in one of two ways, and maybe even a little of both.   1.	Voice recognition. Siri would be able to recognize your personal voice like Face ID or Touch ID and give you information without needing to unlock your phone.  2.	Using a code word to unlock your phone or vocalize the 4-6+ digit numerical passcode to unlock your device when prompted by Siri.   What do you think? How should a feature like that be implemented in order to ensure privacy and security while using Siri, but also making Siri more confident to use hands free?"

I‚Äôm not sure if anyone here can help or not but worth a shot since I asked on r/Spotify as well but it seems as if that‚Äôs a sub mainly for playlists.  I set my iPhone up to be able to use ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù and have her play specific songs on Spotify for me. But once I‚Äôm done listening to a specific song and want to go back to my liked songs (for anyone unfamiliar with Spotify it‚Äôs basically just one big main playlist of songs  that you‚Äôve clicked a heart icon on while listening to it). But when I tell Siri to play my liked songs on Spotify she always plays some playlist that‚Äôs called ‚Äúliked from radio‚Äù which apparently I have and there‚Äôs only one song on it. I‚Äôve tried deleting the ‚Äúliked from radio‚Äù playlist but it doesn‚Äôt work.  Any suggestions?
 why siri doesn t respond when the music is playing??
"A good example of this is Fantastic! You'd think it'd just say fantastic right? No, it says Fantastic! Like it's happy.  It even does some funny stuff based on phrases/context like ""no"" you'd expect ""no"" to always be no? Not quite. If for example you put three in a row like ""no no no"" it will speak it as no no no like it's getting scared.  It's interesting hearing the little bits of emotion they've thrown in here and there and AFAICT this is only a feature of the main siri voices, the normal voices don't do this."

"I think the key reasons why voice will win out are accessibility, versatility, and user empowerment.   **Accessibility**: Voice levels the tech-playing field, especially for older generations that aren‚Äôt well equipped to run their lives on tiny screens and complicated app interfaces.  **Versatility**: As we continue building use cases around voice platforms, we enable a single point of interaction that can handle hundreds of problems for us.  **Empowering:** Voice assistants enable the Bruce Almighty experience - feeling back in control of technology instead of the other way around.

How or where do I create a Siri command to ask to clear all notifications when iPhone is locked?  I‚Äôm lazy and don‚Äôt want to manually clear notifications rather I‚Äôd just say ‚ÄúHey Siri clear all my notifications‚Äù when phone is on lock.  Google is not my bff today.
Found that a bit creepy/a subtle dig cause Google is always listening to us
"So the problem I have is this.. i connect my Bluetooth headphones, start spotify, play music, adjust the volume to where want it (loud, usually) and begin my exercise. If I say ""hey siri, play the next song"" siri responds but when the music comes back on it's at low volume.   I've searched this sub and also did my requisite google searches for this problem but only found issues related to siri's volume itself. I tried changing siri's volume as well but it still does this. Even if siri's volume is set loud, it defaults me back to low on the music. Very annoying.  Any ideas?"
"Hello all, I just wanted to ask early iOS14 adopters if Shazam Integration has improved using Siri.  One big flaw I find extremely annoying in IOS13 is that if I use Siri to ID a song playing (‚Äúhey Siri, what‚Äôs playing?/what‚Äôs this song?‚Äù et al) it will Shazam it in the bg while responding something like ‚Äúlet me have a listen‚Äù and will eventually find it and display it as a Siri response, BUT it will not be saved in the shazams list, which means that if I don‚Äôt interact with the result and, say, the screen turns off, the ID is gone (forever...)  Can somebody tell me if this is somehow ‚Äúfixed‚Äù in iOS14?  Thanks in advance üòä"
"I asked Siri ‚Äúif it was 7 o‚Äôclock what time would it be if 8 hours had passed‚Äù and it just kept tell me the current time.   Am I just wording it weird because I‚Äôve tried at least 10 different ways of asking including saying I don‚Äôt want the current time and it‚Äôs always the same thing   The amount of time I‚Äôve spent on this I would have been better off just not being lazy and doing the math myself but I‚Äôm over that now, I wanna know why Siri can‚Äôt add hours"
"Siri likes pulling up web pages for simple things like math equations and stuff that I‚Äôve seen Siri just say rather than giving me web options   HOW DO I STOP SIRI FROM SHOWING ME WEB RESULTS  I never use Siri to look something up the only time I need it is to check something in an Apple app like weather or again the calculator.   Is there a way to completely stop Siri from using safari or chrome and having it only give me straight forward answers. I do not mind hearing. ‚ÄúSorry I don‚Äôt know that one‚Äù because at least the ai is admitting it can‚Äôt do something rather than giving me something completely unrelated   Also on a side note why can‚Äôt Siri calculate time, I asked for what time It‚Äôd be 8 hours past 7 and it just told me the current time"

"Just got a max recently and you can have it announce the time on the hour, it can do it in all of Siri‚Äôs stock voices and some extra one like Scottish English. Is there anyway to enable these voices for Siri as I can‚Äôt seem to find a way."
"Trying to use Hey Siri with maps. I‚Äôve got my favourites set up in maps. But when I use Hey Siri, the feedback shows it has understood what I‚Äôve said and everything is spelt properly but it won‚Äôt navigate to a favourite. It goes off and finds something irrelevant. Is this what happens to other people or is it just me? Is there anything I can do to improve it?"
"I have multiple languages (for keyboards) but English is the first choice. However, when I click on a Siri suggested wiki page, it defaults to the second language.  Yet I know the content exists in English - and even the summary in the results is in English.   I should not have to remove the keyboard to fix this. Any ideas?"
"Every time I would ask siri to add something to a list, she would say ""Ok, added"" but she would say it with a cadence as if my name was ""added."" Imagine saying ""ok, John"" vs ""ok, added"" - in the second instance you would have a significant pause after the word ""ok"" and this bug has been driving me nuts for months and they finally fixed it!  I filed an official bug with apple months ago and I have been waiting for this day. HALLELUJAH."
"I have a question and if this is the wrong subreddit to ask this please point me in the right direction. Why does Siri suggested websites give me irrelevant results to what I‚Äôm searching. I tried to look up the song Superman by Goldfinger from the tony hawk game for the ps2  this morning but I had forgotten the name of the band, so I wanted to type ‚ÄúSuperman skate song‚Äù into spotlight. I got as far as ‚ÄúSuperman skate s‚Äù before a bunch of weird suggested websites popped up. Some had to do with orthopedics and spirituality and something with the word wheely and a really weird one that had to do with male ability. I haven‚Äôt looked up anything on safari or any of my apps for Siri to suggest this. How do I get rid of it and stop it from showing up? Looking up ‚ÄúSuperman skate‚Äù brings up  normal results like YouTube videos on skate tricks or skate shops but however typing that extra s brings up those weird results. Any help would be appreciated. TL;DR  My spotlight searches bring up weird irrelevant results to what I typed. How do stop it from doing that?"
Scenario: my colleague and I seem to have the same voice frequency so that when I would try to activate my Siri it also triggers his.  Then what happens next is weird: one of the two Siri stops immediately to let the other answer even without one of the two Siri making any audible feedback to its activation... Sometimes his Siri would stop to let mine speaking and sometimes the opposite ü§î   So my question is how does Siri could know that another Siri has been triggered at the same time while not hearing it ? Does it mean iPhone devices communicate  ?
I just realised that the British Siri voice sounds like Paddington from the films and now I can‚Äôt stop hearing it.
"This has never happened before but Siri read out my text messages via my AirPods, I immediately googled it but it seems it‚Äôs not technically supported on 1st gen AirPods.   Hasn‚Äôt happened since, very strange. I was also able to reply via my AirPods."
"Pre-iOS 13, Siri would create reminders lighting fast. The instant I was done speaking, the reminder would be ready to go. However, ever since Apple redesigned the Reminders app in iOS 13, Siri takes about 3-6 seconds to create a reminder. Not a huge deal, I know, but it is noticeably slower compared to other Siri tasks. And it‚Äôs particularly annoying when I‚Äôm listing to a podcast or music and I have to wait for Siri to finish.   Two questions: Does anyone notice the slowdown in iOS 13, or is it just me? And did iOS 14 improve the speed?"
"OK I would like Siri to just record items on a list.  I want to put stuff on a list without a reminder (Reminders) or a to do list(Any.do) or having to add invites (Bring!) I just want to create a list as if I had a pencil and paper...But I want to be able to dictate &amp; I want to be able to do it hands free.  I remember things all day long but then when I need to know, I can‚Äôt remember them.   Is there any way to accomplish this goal?"
I just bought a new iPhone 11 and I signed up to what'sapp and on my friends phone who did not have my new number Siri wrote under my old one the new number of mine how can I turn it off.
"I keep my inbox clean. Right now there are two messages in it, total. But for some reason, whenever I ask Siri to read me my e-mail, it always says I have over 25 messages and lists ALL of my most recent e-mail.  Seems pretty basic Siri. Come on."
Getting really tired of every request I make ‚Äî typically through a HomePod ‚Äî to have a wait time of 30 seconds or so. Preceded by ‚Äòjust a second‚Äô ... ‚Äòworking on that‚Äô ... ‚Äòone more moment‚Äô or one of the many other variations! It‚Äôs so frustrating. You really need time to plan a simple album? üôÑüò≥  Is anybody else experiencing this? Will a router reset or something help speed things up? It‚Äôs become so noticeable lately.
Currently web answers only work in a couple English speaking countries. Even when using US English for Siri and US English as phone language I don‚Äôt get web answers. Has anyone found a way to get these outside the US?
"I often schedule reminders with Siri. However, if I get the notification for the reminder, and cannot complete the task right now, can I re-schedule the reminder using Siri?  Thanks."
"I have spent the last 3 weeks having to ask Siri TWICE for almost every command. Example ""Hey Siri, put this song in my rap playlist"", hmm I cant find a playlist with that name? ""Hey Siri, put this song in my rap playlist"", Sure, Ive added xxx to your rap playlist.    I live between two houses, so Ive tried Siri on two different wifi networks, but still the same problem.    I think even Siri can hear the change of my tone when I have to repeat commands, grr!  Oh and to add, I have every device updated, but I still have no Handsoff (iPhone 6S+) and even with bluetooth off and the iPhone facedown, they both battle out for who's gonna play the music I asked for (usually iPhone wins, NOT what I intended).    First world problems..."

"Hey All,   I‚Äôve been having an issue with Siri lately. When I have my AirPods in, I get a notification sound that I received a text, but Siri will not read it out loud to me anymore.

"It seems recently that when I ask something to Siri that it will say ""I found something on web about &lt;whatever I asked&gt;, check it out"" but the screen is blank (with just the siri light blob thing at the bottom)."
"Hey!  I bought an iphone SE (original version) a few months ago, and until recently it was working just fine, but a few weeks ago I noticed that it‚Äôs not picking up my voice very well. After some looking around I found out that Siri started to use the backpanel microphone (camera microphone) to listen to my voice.  I don‚Äôt know why this happened  because my normal microphone is working perfectly.   I was hoping that some one could help me with this problem.  Thanks in advance!  Greg"
Currently I‚Äôm only able to do School and Work locations.
X was my girlfriend 3 months ago. Today i asked siri to call my girlfriend and she called X. how can i change my girlfriend on siri.
"Hi  Would someone know how to go about creating a shortcut for UNLOVE song in apple music (unpressing love/back to neutral)?  Siri is not responding to UNLOVE, it only understands LOVE (suggest more like this) and DISLIKE (suggest less like this).   I‚Äôve set up smart playlists that add loved songs from a specific genre to a playlist, and removing love status removes them from that playlist.   I need a quick way to UNLOVE because I‚Äôm using music in the car with bluetooth.   If anyone has any suggestions on how to do this with either SIRI or SHORTCUTS, I would be very grateful.   Thank you all"
"I set Siri to speak English but my music library contains titles in different languages (Russian, Italian, French,...) so if I say ‚ÄúSiri play *english title*‚Äù it obviously plays it no problem but if I say ‚ÄúSiri play *italian title*‚Äù she doesn‚Äôt understand; is there a way around it?"
"Hi, after a search I saw this talked about in ways a few years ago and I'm curious if there are any updates.  Is it possible to trigger a Homekit scene with an alarm or a timer?  * Time scheduled scenes work, but as someone that sleeps inconsistent hours,  it would be great to be able to trigger a HomeKit scene just by my setting an alarm.  Has any discovered any alternative useful phrases for Siri + Homekit?  * EG. I used to say ""Hey Siri set the scene to Night"" but after a few years realized I could just say ""Hey Siri Goodnight"" to trigger the same scene. Has anyone discovered any other useful ""simple"" phrases?   Thanks!"
"I'm a fan of the idea what you can do with Siri, however, I don't seem to be using it for more than cooking timers. Everything else I tend to continue doing via the regular way.  Therefore, I'm wondering what you might be using Siri for? What do you do daily with Siri?"
"I don't know what's happened, but for whatever reason as of late, I cannot open Spotify through Siri.  What'll happen is that I'll say ""Hey Siri, open Spotify"" and then she'll respond back with ""Which text?""   Anyone else come across this annoying problem?"
"Hi,
 
 I have a problem with Siri. She doesn‚Äôt hear me that well. I have to speak very loudly and have the iPhone real close to me. Also, the hey Siri function is no longer functioning.

Also, all calls are great. Does anyone know how can I fix this issue?
 
 Thanks for all responses"
Is there a way to prevent the iPhone screen from turning on when using ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù when using AirPods? It will constantly turn on in my pocket now.
I‚Äôve added my family as sister/mother etc. in my contact card. When using Siri by saying e.g. ‚ÄúCall my sister‚Äù I end up calling myself. Is this a bug or have I done something wrong?  Thanks in advance!
"Hi there.    When using the phrase ‚Äúremind me about this‚Äù in any native application like mail , safari , phonebook etc , Siri will make a reminder with a link to that application and the specific email/page/phone number etc.  This was working for me in the photos as well , but it suddenly stopped.  Also at my wife‚Äôs phone it never worked for photos.  Any ideas?"
"Howdy  I'm pretty new in the Apple thing, I only have an iPad Yeah that's really nothing But I watch videos from iJustine and I recently discovered the HomePod And it seems to be a really great speaker... that is connected. And even if I don't use a lot Siri on my iPad, she seems to be smart (in the light and basic side)  But something has bothered me : Siri (and so the HomePod) seems to ""know"" iJustine music preference a lot through Apple Music. And that triggers me. How does Siri know the music preference of the user ? Beyond just ""like/dislike"" music, there must be something more deep than that.  And I have another question, it concerns privacy. Does Siri always listen to you ? I know that Apple is really putting in front of their pages that they want to make our data as much as private as possible and the minimum of our data is transmitted to their servers, but imagine if the HomePod (or any iDevice that has Siri enabled) is neir of you speaking of something, does Siri (and so Apple) know it ?  Ho and, I have the French version of Siri (because I'm in Belgium and my native language is French) but the English Siri (on the HomePod) of iJustine seems to be more personal... Like... She kinda respond to iJustine when she said ""my God"" when Siri announced a lot of lists she had  I hope that done of you could give me some lights on Siri (and by the way I want a Siri update in iOS 14 it would be so great)"
"Ok, so I use both iPhone and android phones. I love my iPhone and the whole ecosystem, but there‚Äôs one thing that has always made me return to android... Siri!! I drive a lot and use CarPlay or android auto all the time. I‚Äôm also bilingual. So when using android auto if I were to get a message in Spanish, google assistant will read it in Spanish for me and I would be able to reply back to it in Spanish as well. Same thing with English, if I get a English message the assistant would read it in English and I would be able to reply in English. Also when asking random questions she would be able to answer them reading directly from the source. Another thing she can do is receive two commands in a single sentence which is great. For example I can say ‚Äúturn the fan on and set temperature to 70‚Äù, the assistant would turn my fan on and set the A/C to 70 in my house.   Siri on the other hand when receiving a message other than English will read out gibberish and if I were to reply in another language other than English, she would write English words that are similar to what I said. When asking questions, most of the time all she finds are articles where we have to read it in order to find our answer. Lastly, Siri can only do one command at a time and is it wouldn‚Äôt be that distracting if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that you have to say the trigger frase every single time.   I know some is all about privacy and stuff, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing some of my info if it was to make Siri more useful. I‚Äôd love to get that multilingual support."
Mysterious answers if you don't know who/what they are.
Allow me to pick certain songs that won‚Äôt let Siri react while they‚Äôre playing. Sick of trying to sing along to Private Eyes by Hall &amp; Oates and Siri turning on every damn time I get to the chorus! None of the lines even **sound** like I‚Äôm saying ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù
"So I was watching a Mr. Nighmare video (He's a YouTuber who reads scary stories submitted by fans.) and he was reading a story about a guy who was woken up by Siri saying ""It was July 4th, 1776,"" the answer was a response to the question ""What that found for us?"" Now I know it's about the foundation of the US, but since I have Siri, I decided to ask this question, when I did, Siri just closed, I said ""Hello"" to test it, and it was normal, but for someone reason, when I ask ""What that found for us?"" Siri just closes. I found nothing relating to Siri when I looked it up, only stuff relating to the Revolutionary War. I would appreciate all the help I can get, thanks.  TLDR; Siri closes when I say ""What that found for us?"" curious as to why it does that."
"   Hey guys,  As we are approaching the 1Home Bridge launch, now it‚Äôs the perfect timing to ask yourself, why even integrate Apple HomeKit?   More in the article below: [www.1home.io/blog/apple-homekit-knx-loxone/](http://www.1home.io/blog/apple-homekit-knx-loxone/)"
"When in a car, Siri now displays an automobile image in the background when triggered.  She will navigate using Apple Maps, but refuses to open Spotify. I‚Äôve looked through settings, but haven‚Äôt found anything relevant.   Anyone have any pointers?"
"I've had a couple issues with my AirPods Pro that have mostly been resolved (fingers crossed). I've had to reset and re-pair several replacement pairs. But this evening I noticed that Siri turned itself on once on my iPhone 11, just caught it with the corner of my eye. Odd, I thought. I listen to a lot of music, and sometimes I ask Siri to turn the volume up or down. Tonight, she is 1) sometimes giving me voice feedback and sometimes not and 2) being inconsistent with how long she sticks around. Sometimes she completes the command and goes away; other times she sticks around and the volume is reduced until I say, ""Hey Siri, goodbye"" which is really annoying if I just want the volume turned up or down. This wasn't an issue until today... Unsure if other ppl. have this issue."
"I don‚Äôt remember this ever happening, and I hope I‚Äôm not missing something obvious, but for the last few days, Siri will only answer certain inquiries if I say ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù first. This is true on iPad 7, iPhone XR, Apple Watch 4 and HomePod. I used to be able to hold the sleep/wake button and just ask something like ‚ÄúWho is The Rock?‚Äù and Siri would give an answer. Now, all I get is ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong, try again‚Äù. However, if I say ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù first, then ask, I get the correct response, like a short bio and Wikipedia link.  This happened seemingly random out of nowhere. I updated iOS and HomePod to the 13.5 and 13.4.5 software, same thing. Asking Siri to do stuff on-device like setting alarms works as usual, and I can even get cloud music to play via Apple Music. It‚Äôs definitely not an internet issue, as everything else works fine on WiFi and LTE.  Any suggestions?"
"I say, ""Siri, text xyz what's up?""   Siri says, ""Messages doesn't support the group xyz, what group would you like to send it to?""   I say, ""xyz""   Siri says:  ""Ok, ready to send it?""   It used to happen a little bit, but now it's happening every time.  Any ideas?"
"Is anyone else having trouble with this?   I'll say ""Hey Siri, call \*name of person in my contacts\*"" and she'll respond with ""I'm sorry, I don't see \*name of person\* in your contacts."" Same goes for if I say ""Hey Siri, text \*person\*.""  But then if I say ""Hey Siri, show me contact information for \*same person in my contacts\*"" she'll pull up their contact card no problem. This only happens on my iPhone. My iPad doesn't have any issues finding the contacts to call or text them. What gives?!  Anyone else having this issue? I feel like I've done all of the obvious stuff to troubleshoot it.. I've hard restarted the device. I've tried turning Siri and Hey Siri off. I've tried turning my contacts off, deleting them from my device entirely and then turning contacts back on. I've even tried making new contact cards for the people I call and text most frequently. Nothing has worked.  Any advice? I'm this close to completely resetting my phone and setting it up as a new device."
"just curious, what accent and language do you use for siri? i wonder if majority of people use the american accent more compared to british or others"
"Something really bizarre happened with Siri today, and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like it. My baby was holding my phone, and she must have turned on Siri. I said ""(Daughter's Name), put down the phone."" Siri misheard it as ""GO DEEP DOWN THE PHONE."" This led to a choose-your-own-adventure style story about Goldilocks &amp; the three bears. It first asked you whether you were playing as Papa, Mama, or Baby Bear. When you answered, it asked you whether you wanted to go to the living room, bedroom, or wake up Goldilocks, and it told you a story about what happens with Goldilocks. We repeated this several times to see all the different endings. One ended with Goldi throwing herself out the window, and Baby Bear commenting that she was ""just a kid, like me."" Another ended with Goldi's mom picking her up, and Baby and Goldi staring at each other with regret. It was a bit unsettling, and seemed really strange because A) Who would ever randomly say ""Go deep down the phone"" on purpose; and B) What does that have to do with Goldilocks?  Then, it got really freaky. I texted a few friends to try it. They all got the same thing - the Goldilocks story. I Googled ""SIRI GO DEEP DOWN THE PHONE"" to see if anyone else had discovered this. I got no results, so I posted it on my Facebook page, excited to have discovered a new Easter Egg. A few minutes later, one of my friends who had gotten the Goldilocks story earlier texted me, freaking out because she went to show her husband, and it no longer worked. Siri just said ""I didn't get that."" I tried it again - same thing! ""I didn't get that."" All my friends are now getting the same response.  So my question is...what on Earth happened!?!? Has anyone ever heard of an Easter Egg suddenly disappearing? One of my friends suggested it was maybe written into the code to disable as soon as the phrase was detected online, but to what end? Just to gaslight someone? Interested in hearing your thoughts."

"I haven't used Siri a alot although I have has an iPhone since 5. However, now I set up an old one as a ""Kitchen Aid"" thingy. However, I can't really figure out how to dismiss alarms and such.  If I set up a cooking alarm, say ""Hi Siri, set a timer for 15 minutes."", after 15mins it'll ring, but how do I dismiss the notification? How do I \*stop\* it from ringing after I have already noticed the alarm? I can of course go and touch the phone, but that's really awkward and frankly a stupid solution for a problem like this."

"So this morning I woke up and went to ask Siri what time it was, I had only gotten ‚Äòhey Siri‚Äô out before she responded. Her response was a bit startling and I haven‚Äôt been able to get her to say it again.

"Hey guys so I have a question. Usually when I have my iPhone and my iPad next to me and call ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù both devices open Siri but then the command only follows trough on my iPhone, or on iPad if it is a bit closer to me than the iPhone is. Is it possible to call for Siri on both devices simultaneously? Or for example if Siri opens on the iPhone is it possible to command her to open the app on the iPad? Cause even tho we have ‚Äúhandsoff‚Äù for apps I find that Siri is really restricted to each device and would be very cool if it crossed them.  Also sorry for any mistake, english is not my main language."

(I don‚Äôt know why, but seems like my sneeze sounds a lot like ‚ÄúHey, Siri!‚Äù)  So, I fooled around, just because.. and ask Siri in English (my phone is set up in English) ‚ÄúWhat are you doing, Siri?‚Äù  And Siri answered...  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at nutrition facts of almond bla bla bla‚Äù    I mean, it could just be a coincidence, but still..."
"    Hello! I‚Äôm a researcher from the University of Liverpool, UK. We are currently researching virtual assistants like Siri and how they relate to employment and Accent.  We are investigating this to analyse how useful and beneficial virtual assistants like Siri are at work, and also to analyse the commonly reported problem of people with certain accents finding it harder for virtual assistants to interpret their commands.  Once we have collected enough data it will be forwarded to the R&amp;D divisions of all the relevant companies, like Apple. So if you help us out you may actually have an impact on how virtual assistants are designed!  If you would like to complete the short survey, it will take around 10 minutes and is available at the link below.

"I'm a graduate student from the University of Washington in Seattle, WA studying human-centered design. I'm conducting interviews as part of my final research study to understand the experiences of diverse users with digital assistants like Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and Google.  Do you use one of these services? Then you are in an ideal position to help me with valuable information from your own perspective.  The interview takes around 30 minutes and is very informal. I am simply trying to capture your thoughts and perspectives on using voice assistants. Your responses will be kept confidential.   If you're willing to participate, please use this [link](https://calendly.com/cbpechousuw) to suggest a day and time that suits you.   All participants will be entered into a raffle to win a Visa gift card."
Confused to what is causing siri to give time lengths or dates to the situation. One belief is that it has to do with 0-2400 hour times ? But other people get actual date answers ? Someone check according to asking it when does 2021 end and so forth please.
"So I have a room with two devices. A lamp and a light.  I named the devices Family Room Light and Family Room Lamp  I say to Siri, turn on the family room light and both turn on. This changed a few days ago (or even just a day ago). I was able to say turn on the family room light and ONLY the light turned on.   Ok ok. I know, both devices are set as lights in HomeKit so why shouldn‚Äôt they go on, right?  Well that‚Äôs not how it was working just last week.    What do you all say (or use) for the names of a lamp and a light in the same room?"
When I try to tell her something it won‚Äôt respond like the line at the bottom would just cut off immediately when I touch that button it would hear me but cut off? Help?
I use the bedtime feature on my phone everyday but my sleep schedule keeps on changing. Every night before I go to sleep I have to change my bedtime hours accordingly. All I want to know is that if there is any way by which I can change my bedtime hours through Siri. Any help would be much appreciated.
"I've been using Siri more and more, just about everywhere. She's pretty amazing.  One thing I often do is walk away from my desk (MacBook Pro with external monitor) and want to turn off the screen without waiting for it to sleep.  Do we know if it's at all possible to do this? Maybe a shortcut, app, integration, something?  Thanks!"
"I‚Äôm having issues with pairing my iPhone with my 2016 Ford Fusion. The pairing process seems to go ok, but I can‚Äôt hear Siri talking whenever I activate her.   I noticed on the lower right of the Siri screen, there‚Äôs a Bluetooth icon. I clicked on it, and noticed that there‚Äôs two instances of Sync listed. I‚Äôm unable to select the top listing, but I‚Äôm thinking this  is why I‚Äôm unable to hear Siri. Has anyone else had this happen, and how did you fix it?  Here‚Äôs a screenshot of it.  https://i.imgur.com/T4lWE5A.jpg"

"hi! i am a little confused on siri using apple tv. if i want to turn the tv on or off without using the remote, i tried saying, ""turn off apple tv"" or ""turn tv volume up"", but it doesn't work. it only works if i press the voice button the apple tv remote. is this how it is designed?  &amp;#x200B;  also this is random, but does apple tv not recognize the show tiger king?"
"If you ask Siri ""What's up"" or tell her ""I love you"", she will tell you to wash your hands for 20 seconds and to stay indoors"
"I‚Äôm looking for resources to help a lay person learn how to properly use shortcuts. I just graduated nursing school and I‚Äôm good with computers, but im self taught in technology.   I‚Äôd like to make some shortcuts for work. IE. I want my shortcut to launch a preset reminders list each time I arrive at my workplace.   Any resources out there that I would be able to understand and learn from? I‚Äôd like to get the most out of Siri"
I‚Äôm telling her to ‚ÄúPlay Sober by Tool‚Äù and she plays  Sober by Twinkle Twinkle Little Rockstar.
"I use alarms with vibration only and timer with some soothing sound, but every time I set any of those using Siri it plays the default annoying extra loud sound that scares the shit outta me when I forget to change it manually. Really pisses me off. Checked all the settings, didn‚Äôt  find anything. Am I dumb or do they really not have an option to change it? That would be a shame"
I tried a ton of colors with Siri to see which ones she understands. You can use these with HomeKit to change Light colors. Check them out here. The list is pretty large.   [https://smarthomeexplained.com/siri-light-colors/](https://smarthomeexplained.com/siri-light-colors/)
its fucking stupid when i say it she  tells who she is its like shit
Can you make siri not be able to text a contact?
"When I ask siri to read messages when on silent, it puts a yes/no question on the screen.  This is kinda useless because I usually do it while driving and can't look at the screen.  This used to work but I just switched to a new phone so I'm not sure if that's when the changed or there was a SW release that changed this.  I can't find any settings to override this new behavior.  Anyone know how to get around this?"
I really like this feature   I have it set automatically when I go to sleep every night at certain time.   But I really like when it sees I have a meeting and asks me if I would like to go into DND(do not disturb).   But I find it doesn‚Äôt always come up on my screen. Also I would love this to automatically happen so I didn‚Äôt always have to turn it on?   Can anyone help/advise on this?
But why the heck do I need to unlock my iPhone first before Siri will tell me the weather? Is there a workaround that I‚Äôm missing? It must be something stupid easy that I‚Äôm overlooking.
"I can't really find a solid answer, some say that charging it overnight and keeping it plugged in even at 100% will damage the battery in the long run, some say newer phones (I have the iPhone XR) automatically stop charging at 100% and it won't damage the phone or battery if plugged in past 100%  Anyone here got a solid answer?"
Is it normal that my iPhone 8 I bought a yer ago nowadays has the 93% of battery health?

"Siri battery drain issue. What to do?  Hello.  I had no problem with my IPhone X, but when I recently upgraded to IPhone XR this problem started. I posted the pictures [here](https://imgur.com/a/MXF23l3). I factory reset my phone after 2 days of Siri draining my battery in half a day. It did not resolve the issue. I am desperate. What is there to do, because it frustrates me extremely.A phone is for you to resolve problems, make your life easier, but this is exactly the opposite. What can i do?"
"When I tell Siri ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how you pronounce it‚Äù when pulling up someone‚Äôs contact, it doesn‚Äôt save the new pronunciations. Is this just for me or are others having this issue?"
"I can't  be the only one having this problem. Everyday I use Bluetooth in my car to use Waze for directions to and from work. While the map is up, if I ask Siri to play a playlist or song, or whatever, after she finishes with the command, the screen stays on the Siri response screen instead of going back to Waze. How can I fix this?"
"On my Bf iPhone XR Siri will randomly activate, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs voice command related or a bug of sort. But it does coincidentally activate when he was saying something but nothing close to ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù   This hasn‚Äôt been a one time thing. I have witnessed it at least a handful with him plus more that he has seen too on top   Will toggling the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù feature off and on again, will that correct the issue do you think?   We haven‚Äôt been able to replicate it, and often forget what was said out of surprise"
I was sitting in my bed with my bf while my phone was charging on my desk. All of a sudden the Siri voice suddenly says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pondering eternity and it‚Äôs taking forever‚Äù and my bf and I both froze looking at each other. When we looked at my phone there was no Siri chat history of her saying anything like that and when I looked it up nothing came up. Is it possible my phones been hacked? I honestly can‚Äôt think of any explanation. We weren‚Äôt talking so I can‚Äôt think of anything that would‚Äôve triggered Siri to come on
"I copied her settings of language USA English, with British accent, but I can‚Äôt get my Siri on iPhone XR to say anything more than ¬´¬†I‚Äôm here etc¬†¬ª.   She doesn‚Äôt have AirPods, or any other Apple device.   Anyone know why hers responds like that?"
"Weird thing started happening recently.   I can no longer use Siri to change my Ecobee 3 thermostat settings. HomeKit scenes and manual on-screen adjustment still work just fine, but Siri just responds with, **‚ÄúSorry, I wasn't able to find anything like that in your Home this time.‚Äù**  I've tried ""change the temperature to... "" ""set the thermostat to..."" and ""set the Ecobee to..."" and get the same result.  Anyone else experienced this?"
"For the past week or so, any request to Siri to play a song, artist, album or playlist from my music library, just fails.  She recognises the artist or track name because it gets capitalised but then she says  ""Sorry, I'm having trouble with the connection. Please try again.""  I've tried a settings reset, I even switched to a new phone but this is still failing on iOS 13.3.1  Anyone have a similar experience or any idea how I can fix this?"
"I have Siri read me my texts through my AirPods when my phone is locked. However instead of pausing my audio when she‚Äôs reading, she just makes it quieter. Not only does that make it harder to make out what Siri is saying, but if I‚Äôm listening to a podcast I miss a good 20 seconds of it. Is there an option I can turn on to make her complete pause audio while she‚Äôs active, and resume it when she‚Äôs done?"

"First level Apple support doesn‚Äôt know what to make of this. This has been going on for multiple major releases but I can‚Äôt get it escalated until I upgrade from 13.1 to whatever the current release is, 13.3?  I triggered Siri and said:  Create alarm labeled call for a ride to the store because I‚Äôm too tired to walk  Siri correctly transcribed what I said, properly recognizing the contraction for ‚ÄúI am‚Äù and the adjective ‚Äútoo‚Äù on the screen.  However, when asking for when I wanted the alarm to alert me, look at what happened to the label I had provided:  Set the ‚Äòa ride to the store because I‚Äôm too tired‚Äô alarm for when?  Why? Siri had heard what I said as my request was perfectly presented on the display. When using the  alarm app I‚Äôve never had the label changed on me.  I‚Äôm pretty sure it was changed by Siri because Siri  clearly does some statefull inspection of the text.  For example, Siri has replied to some alarm labels along the lines of ‚Äúcreate alarm labeled leave for dinner at Friday‚Äôs‚Äù by relying with something along the lines of ‚ÄúI cannot set an alarm for a particular day. Would you like for me to set up a reminder instead?‚Äú  The changes do not appear to be related to the length of the label. In addition, telling it quote label name quote Will indeed result in ‚Äúlabel name‚Äù but it may still mince the label.  Try some for yourself and see what happens.  Any thoughts or suggestions?"

"I‚Äôve requested Siri to ‚ÄúNotify [user‚Äôs name] when I arrive at my destination‚Äù while I‚Äôve had Apple Maps directing me to a destination. I have always gotten the response   ‚ÄúHmm... the Find My Service isn‚Äôt responding right now.‚Äù    This implies to me that the request is a valid phrase, however, has been occurring since iOS 12.   Does it actually work for anyone? Is it the phrasing or is there a phrase that does actually work?"
"Does anyone know if there are any updates coming up for Siri?   I have to text a lot for my job and when I use Siri it is so inaccurate I end up spending more time fixing the text than it would have taken to just type it.    I see people using Android and theirs works almost perfectly.   I don‚Äôt want to switch to Android, really this is my only complaint about IOS.     I use a iPhone x on Verizon.

Every night at 9pm I receive a SIRI SUGGESTION on my iPhone. It tells me to open a specific file that I have on my Google Drive.   Has happened every evening for the past several days.   Is this the singularity trying tell me something? How do I make it stop?
Is there any way to make shortcut that I can copy a script on Notes?

Siri answers with ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù as the subtitle and then what seems like a different language but really softly. It doesn‚Äôt appear as a subtitle.
"Hey guys,   I can easily make a reminder that triggers when I arrive home or at work. But let‚Äôs say that I want to make a reminder when I arrive in a particular restaurant or in a friend‚Äôs place (that should b fetched from the contacts app). What should I say? Do I need a shortcut?"
hey I have a MacBook Pro 2017 and hey Siri is only supported on the 2018 versions and newer. does anybody know if I can somehow download a code that gives me hey siri?
"A couple of days ago Siri stopped reading text messages out loud in CarPlay. It will open the message, say ""So-and-so says..."" and then there's silence where the text should be, then it prompts me with ""Would you like to respond?""  I've asked it to do other things like tell me the weather or name the capital of my state, so I know that Siri is mostly working and it's not a volume issue. Anyone else having a similar problem?"
"I often try to watch specific shows on Netflix by asking Siri, but getting no help from it. Is there a shortcut I can make or a way to do more then just open the app?"
"Anyone else experience Siri announcing messages in a very low volume, even when volume on AirPods is up high?"
We have only noticed this when using CarPlay. Normally we don‚Äôt have Siri read our messages. If we get a text ‚ÄúHa Ha Ha‚Äú sometimes when Siri is reading the text it will emphasize the last HA with a higher pitched voice and increase speed like it is laughing. But most of the time it drones the words in a regular voice.  We have tried to duplicate this several times and cannot. Is it just a random event or is there a way we can make Siri laugh?
"This used to work but suddenly stopped and I can‚Äôt find the option to turn it on anywhere in settings, how can I fix this?"
"I just got an iPhone 11, and it‚Äôs great except that when I use Hey Siri in my car, connected to the car Bluetooth (2013 Prius c), I can‚Äôt hear Siri talk. I see that this has a separate volume level, but I now have it all the way up (in fact Siri indicates that her volume is at max if I ask her to talk louder, but only in the text on screen). My old iPhone 7 would switch to the Hands Free Bluetooth when I used Hey Siri (like for calls) and that worked, but with this phone it still seems to be using Bluetooth audio (for music) for Hey Siri and it makes no sound. All I get is the text on screen. I‚Äôve tried unpairing and re-pairing and I‚Äôve also tried turning Siri off and back on. Nothing helps. Is anyone else running into this problem and has anyone found a solution?  It's also worth noting that music plays fine and even Apple Maps Siri voice works fine over the Bluetooth audio, but not Hey Siri. I‚Äôm at my wits ends here."
"Yesterday I started a free trial of Apple Music and I guess I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out how to word my problem, because I‚Äôm not finding much about it while searching the web.   Until today, if I asked Siri (while using CarPlay) to play whatever song or artist, it would play. Today I tried asking for a song or artist and Siri would reply ‚ÄúSorry, you‚Äôre not on Wifi and haven‚Äôt enabled cellular data.‚Äù The songs I want to listen to are all on my phone...I don‚Äôt need Siri to search Apple Music for them. How do I make Siri play music from my library?   I have not yet synced my library with Apple Music because I‚Äôm not sure I want to keep the service and, when I tried to match my songs with Google Play Music a couple years ago, there were a lot of songs that Google just plain got wrong, and it was kind of a pain to fix. It was hard to determine out of thousands of songs, which ones were missing because Google thought they were completely different songs I‚Äôve never even heard of. (And for what it‚Äôs worth, I do use MusicBrainz Picard.)"
"My dad is tetraplegic and cannot move his fingers. I am wondering if there is a way to get Siri to answer incoming phone calls on an iPhone 8? Is there a way to unlock your iPhone using Siri? Also, if there are any other tricks we should know to make it easier for my dad to use his iPhone without the use of his fingers, please do tell. Thank you."
"So this thing have just happened a few weeks ago, whenever I ask Siri to play music or search for one, Siri would tell me to wait, delay for a long period of time and then report that I'm having a network connection problem, despite that I can manually open the song in Apple Music easily. At first I thought that was just an update bug (currently at IOS 13.3), but turns out it's not since my friend's Siri still work fine.   Have a research on the Internet about fixing it but nothing worked for me. Anyone in the same situation?"
"Is Siri supposed to change its voice on all iCloud linked devices if you make a change on one device?   I use the male Siri voice on my iPhone, but on my MBP, I use the female voice. I upgraded my MBP OS and when complete, the voice changed to the male Siri. Not a problem. I changed it back to the female Siri voice.   When I invoked Siri on my iPhone later that day, to my surprise, its voice was now female Siri voice as well?"
"So i asked Siri to search for a song it was playing, and it did so using shazam in the background. I thought it wouldve been saved, so i locked the phone. Now I cannot find where to see my history.. is there a way to go back at it or is that gone forever?"
"I noticed whenever I say ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù, I don‚Äôt hear the beep anymore. I was waiting for a beep but all I get it a ‚Äúhmmm‚Äù."

"As in, setting up a reminder for when I connect to my home wifi, or when the weather is at least 25 degrees C.  I tried hey Siri'ing but she didn't understand the requests.  Reminders based on when I get home ping when I'm in a 100-meter radius, I'd like a smaller radius. Not when I'm still a few minutes away from home."
"Is there a way to get Siri to read incoming text messages without Airpods or CarPlay? I want my phone (8 on iOS 13.3) to read my texts aloud while driving, ideally with a prompt for me to respond with voice, but I do not have CarPlay. Thanks!"
"I don't own an iPhone, but the majority of my family does. When they go to text me, they say ""Hey Siri, text *name* (message)"". Unfortunately I tend to go by the shorter version of my name, one that is also a noun and/or a verb. To combat this, my mother has changed my contact to ""My Son *name*"" and that actually does work, but not consistently. Is there any way to make Siri recognize my name as a name, and not as a verb or noun? Note that this was working completely fine until around March or April this year."
"first i noticed,  ‚Äúhey, siri, call dad, work.‚Äù  *calling dad, mobile.*  ‚Äúhey, siri, facetime audio [brother].‚Äô‚Äô  *who would you like to facetime?*  ‚Äúhey, siri, call billy.‚Äù  *hmm. i don‚Äôt seem to have any information for billy. would you like to call [phone number] for billy?*  same set-up, same airpods as the week prior. totally different (unuseful, especially for hands off) results."
"My mam asked me if I wanted out form the shops, I said just loo roll, she replied anything else? And I was driving so I asked Siri to say back that is all I want Xxx but the dabmed bloke said that all i want sex sex sex, so me mam thinks I am a weirdo now thanks Siri"
Is there any way to trigger Siri remotely? Specifically from a different building?   Thanks guys!

I know you can do this with music right now but can you also ask Siri to turn off your lights 2 hours later for example?

"i use ""hey siri"" a lot to text people, and i have a friend named Kaleigh, and it's pronounced kaylee. every time i try to use siri to text her, it says ""kaylee is not in your contacts,, etc."" How do I make it so that siri recognizes the pronunciation/spelling without having to make it a nickname?"
Would be fab for Siri to have several American accents and a bit of sass.
"Hi  Im using the Iphone XS Max, and I was wondering whether one of these browsers use less battery power.   I have a Mac and Safari on Mac is clearly much more efficient than Chrome is, is this the case for iPhone as well?"
"Siri stopped working on my iPhone X. If I hold down the side button, it acts like it's listening and the waveforms react to sound. On the screen it says ""What can I help you with,"" and then ""Go ahead, I'm listening.""  Even though the waveforms react when the Siri buttons is pressed, I tested the microphone with Voice Memos. It seems to work.  I restored my phone as a new phone, thinking that would fix the issue. It didn't.  When I'm in the car and the phone is connected to CarPlay through lighting, Siri does work when I press the button on the steering wheel to activate voice commands. Siri also works when I connect my BeatsX over Bluetooth.  I noticed at the same time this started that my Battery Health says ""Service"" even though maximum capacity is at 94%.  This is a launch day iPhone X that has never been serviced, submerged in water, or dropped.  I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar issue, and if the battery message may be related to Siri only working with CarPlay and Bluetooth."
I have xs max and its battery health 97% does this affect the performance of it ?
Do this right now:  1) Change your Siri voice to Australian (Female)  2) Send yourself a text message that ends in haha (no spaces)  3) Have Siri read this message to you  4) ...  5) Profit  Why does this happen? You don't know.
Hey guys how do you actually make Siri respond with uh huh when you command it? It works for my iPhone 11 but not for my friends iPhone SE. Is there anything to do with the model or settings?
"I often use Siri to identify songs I hear. Apple uses Shazam to ID songs, and none of my ‚ÄúShazamed‚Äù songs actually show up in my Shazam app. Instead, I have to follow the process detailed below to view my shazamed songs. Does anyone know how to get these songs to show up in my Shazam app rather than go through the process below? **How to Locate Your Siri Shazam History.** Inside of the iTunes Store app, tap on the three-dash menu at the top right, then hit the ""Siri"" tab.

"Hey, we have a doggo named Hoshi, and our devices constantly think when we say ""Hoshi"" that we are saying ""Hey Siri"".  I have my doubts... but if anyone has a trick to teach Siri the difference between Hoshi and Hey Siri i'd love to hear them.  Unfortunately, little miss Hoshi is quite the trouble maker so we are forever calling out her name, usually followed by 'stop chewing that' which confuses the hell out of Siri I have to say."
"I.e. if I ask her at 6:00:31, is the alarm set for 6:10:31 or 6:11:00??  Specifically because i'm cooking and obviously time is important. Would prefer timers over alarms but she can only set one at a time.   Thanks"

"So after I updated my iPhone7 to iOS 13 I found out that sometimes when I call Siri, it would beep then just vanish. I have to give it a second call to make it listen to whatever I say. This happened for so many times that it‚Äôs becoming pretty annoying. Come on, Siri is already dumb so don‚Äôt make it even worse, Apple. Have any of you guys experienced this?"
"I got my new iPhone 11 yesterday, and Siri can‚Äôt be heard over my cars Bluetooth. I can hear her perfectly when I tell her to play a podcast, she says one moment, then podcast plays perfectly. But ask her the weather or to read my latest message and I can‚Äôt hear her. I can see her words on the screen, but can‚Äôt hear. Then she freezes and won‚Äôt turn off and my car radio is also frozen and won‚Äôt work until I turn off my phone manually. Yes her volume is all the way up and switch is on.   My iPhone 7 doesn‚Äôt have this issue, Siri is loud and clear. My sons se doesn‚Äôt have this issue, Siri is loud and clear.   I‚Äôm back to using my 7, and will be returning  my 11 unless there is a magic fix for this."
When I ask Siri to dial a Moble number she no longer puts it on speaker!  When I ask Siri to tell me a story all she does now is tell me I don‚Äôt understand....  Are these issues ever going to be fixed or improved upon?
"I have siri commands setup for our home automation stuff.. I'm using globe suite plugs, which run off a app my my phone, which allows me to sent shortcuts to siri. Is there a way I can use those same commands with my mac, or would I need globe suite app on my computer as well??"
"All I want is for Siri to be able to recognize and respond to my ""thank you""s after she does something for me. I'm so nice to her but she can't even here me."
"Hello, Reddit community! I‚Äôve bought a brand new iPhone X and it has been 3 weeks since then. I recently new about the option being able to see your battery health percentage. Surprisingly, the first time I checked, the battery health percentage was 93%. Eventually, it kept lowering down within a week. It is currently at 91% right now. I‚Äôm starting to get really conscious and irritated about it.  Question: Is there any way to increase the battery health percentage? If not, what are the things I should be doing and NOT be doing to maintain the current status?  Thank you!"
"Every time I ask Siri for ‚ÄúFood near me‚Äù she always gives me restaurants located in China... I called an Apple representative to try and fix this but nothing seems to work. Anyone else having this issue/knows a solution? (I‚Äôm in Ohio, for reference)"
My friend told me he knew how to make Siri say OK boomer so I was asked him how and here‚Äôs what he told me  First you have to say to Siri ‚ÄúKnock Knock‚Äù After that say ‚Äúwho‚Äôs there‚Äù After she tells you the first name just say ‚ÄúWho is Ariadna Grande‚Äù  Then she will say OK Boomer
"I use Siri in my daily life, also at work to assist with some definitions, translations, weather and such.  I'm usually listening to music at work, on low volume (with AirPods in). When I activate Siri, the music volume goes to 100%, deafening me. I understand that Siri needs to have an elevated voice even if the volume is low, but should it also affect music volume?  After use, it goes back to the previous volume. I haven't tested it with the iPhone speakers yet."
"I already changed my nickname and everything, but Siri never even says my name. Every time I say hey Siri it just says what can I help you with? Or things like that but it never says my name. Is there anyway I can make it so it says my name every time I say ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù or is there anything I can say so it‚Äôll respond with my name? Besides ‚Äúwhat is my name‚Äù"
"Hey all, sorry if this doesn't belong here but I just wanted to let everyone know I'm running a 50% off IAP promotion from now through November 30th as a Thanksgiving special. My app [Just Timers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-timers/id1453573845?ls=1&amp;mt=8) lets you create multiple, named timers, perfect for cooking a feast! It's free to download, with an In-App Purchase to unlock unlimited timers. I figured plenty of folks will need to keep track of all of the various foods cooking, and just wanted to help out.   The app has a companion watch app that syncs your timers from your phone and lets you create new ones on the watch. I have some big plans coming down in the future including interval timers and cloud sync, as well as making the app a standalone watch app.   There is also support for Siri Shortcuts, so just ask Siri to ""start turkey"" or ""start potatoes"" to trigger your preset timers, hands-free!  I hope you enjoy, any feedback is appreciated!"
"So I am getting extremely fed up with my phone. Since downloading iOS 13, and all of the subsequent updates (I am on the latest iOS) Siri has not been working. I will say ‚Äúhey siri‚Äù and give my request, and it just spins telling me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on it‚Äù and ‚Äújust one minute‚Äù and then gives me the ‚Äúsomething is wrong, try back later‚Äù warning. My watch is doing the exact same thing. I have googled this and it seems like I am the only person with this problem.   I have tried all the suggested fixes like hard rebooting my phone, turning Siri off and on, resetting network connections and so on. Can anyone recommend a fix. I feel like my phone is almost worthless without the ability to use Siri. Thank you."
Has anyone else had the problem with AirPods Pro where when Siri announces new messages while music is playing the volume of the music increases so you can‚Äôt even hear her?  It only happens with music. Was playing a podcast and the volume of the podcast didn‚Äôt change.   Is there a setting for this or is it a bug?
"When you send a text message to someone using siri, she Say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúSend‚Äù to send the message. Or say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù or ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù to cancel the message. And this happens just by the slightes pause, so im wondering if its a way to contue the Message or if you have to start over again.     This is for my handicapped aunt, thanks"
"I run a small delivery service and one of the really frustrating things that pops up occasionally is I‚Äôll put an address in that exists in the city in which I work. Siri will ignore the fact that I‚Äôm located in one place and give me directions to someplace 500 km away that happens to have the same address. It is so stupid.   It means when I‚Äôm on the road and dictating a destination I occasionally have to pull off the road to manually type the address in because every time I dictate if she wants me to drive 500 km.  I do my best to be hands-free across-the-board but sometimes it‚Äôs impossible because Siri is so poorly written.  I‚Äôm ranting I think, I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs any solution for this. It is almost as frustrating as having to repeatedly retype the same word because Siri has absolutely zero ability to learn."
"I just found this Easter egg today, and I have not found any mention of it on the internet.  If you say go die in a hole, go die, or something else like that three times to Siri, she  give normal responses the first two times but on the third one she says ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù and then Siri closes itself."
Why is it when I have full bars to the cell tower Siri tells me she can‚Äôt connect try later?
"iPhone battery saving tip: check your most used apps in Settings &gt; Battery, then turn off ‚ÄúSiri &amp; Search &gt; Learn from this app‚Äù in those apps."
"When I ask Siri what my name is she says that she dosnt know and I need to update it in contacts, but below that she still displays my contact info. When I go to the settings and set someone else as me then put it back to me it works for a bit, but then after 5 minutes it goes back to not knowing me. Any help?"
"I have multiple garage doors connected to my HomeKit through the Chamberlain MyQ system.  The doors are named as Garage Door 1, Garage Door 2, etc.  When using a Siri command, open Garage Door 1 the reply is ‚Äúyou have more than one garage door in this home, ask me again with a specific room or device name.‚Äù  If I use the Siri command open Garage Door number 1 the reply is ‚Äúsorry I can‚Äôt do that for you.‚Äù    I have tried to rename them with the pound sign and there is no difference.    I have renamed them to Garage Door Left and Garage Door Right which Siri can understand but I have 4 doors total and would prefer them to be numbered.    Any ideas on how to fix or properly give the Siri command?  Thank you!"
"Hi r/Siri,   I am currently working on a project for my UX class where I am tasked with making Siri more accessible and improving the experience when using Siri overall. To do so, I am gathering more information on how people use Siri and how often.   I have created a short and anonymous survey to identify how Siri is being used, so if you would like to contribute, please click the following link: [https://forms.gle/FJQbH8AdJshBuoyD9](https://forms.gle/FJQbH8AdJshBuoyD9)  Additionally, please feel free to comment/PM me if you have any questions or concerns.

"Did everyone know this already? I always end up going to Settings &gt; \*scrolling\* &gt; Passwords and Accounts &gt; Website &amp; App Passwords &gt; \*type website name\* to find a password, this is so much better!"
"In the past, I'd be able to ask Siri ""what's on my calendar?"" and she would tell me, without me having to pick up the phone or enter the pass code. Recently (since an iOS update?), her response is ""You'll have to unlock your iPhone first."" How can I make it work like it used to?"
"So you know that TikTok where Siri calls someone a nick name like    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahhahahahahahaaaaaa  Can someone type that out for me, so I can do that?"
I have my contact information in there and the Siri setting showing that I own this phone. My coworkers all are having the same problem.   I know for a fact I‚Äôve tried this in the past on this phone and it has worked. Software glitch?
"For over a year I‚Äôve used my homepods daily. One thing ƒ∞ do regularly is ask daily about the weather and my calendar to decide what to wear for the day. Lately ƒ∞ find ƒ∞ almost automatically ask for the weather and realise when Siri‚Äôs done with the report that ƒ∞ have no idea what it contained and ƒ∞ have to ask again. It‚Äôs almost like my brain knows this isn‚Äôt a human, it‚Äôs not going to be offended, you can filter it out... even tho it‚Äôs helpful information that I‚Äôm actually asking for."
"My wife and sister in law have the same first and last name (I‚Äôll call them both Kate Middleton here), and a different middle name. When I try to use Siri to call one, I‚Äôll say ‚ÄúHey Siri, call Kate Michelle Middleton‚Äù  and Siri will say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see Kate Michelle Middleton in your contacts, who would you like to call?‚Äù I reply with ‚ÄúKate Middleton‚Äù and Siri will say ‚Äúcalling Kate Michelle Middleton‚Äù.  Is this normal and expected?! Is there any way to fix this? This has been happening to me for years on multiple iOS versions and I‚Äôm kind of sick of it.   Let me know if I should post somewhere else. Thanks!"
"Anyone else bothered when asking Siri the weather and she says ‚Äúsome bad weather coming up‚Äù ... I don‚Äôt like hearing that the weather is ‚Äúbad‚Äù, I live in a cold place and have to hear her say that the weather is ‚Äúbad‚Äù daily. Very bothersome!"
"I remember on a previous ios, when you activated siri there would be a little noise.   I've just upgraded to an iPhone 11, running ios 13.   When I long press the side button to activate siri there is no noise.   Until I look at the phone I don't know if I've activated siri or just locked it.   Any way to have auditory or haptic feedback on when siri is activated?"
" I have a set up which has a Vizio TV with built-in Chromecast and use my iphone to cast youtube on it. Often when I play music this way, ‚Äúhey siri‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work properly. The phone would listen for a few second then stop, instead of listen for the whole phrase. I tried casting music through Airplay, siri is working perfectly fine. Does anyone having the same problem? Thanks"
Earlier I was talking to some people and heard the Siri sound go off and saw that Siri was listening. I know I wasn‚Äôt holding the side button because my phone was silenced so it wouldn‚Äôt have made the noise. The strange thing was that Siri hadn‚Äôt picked up ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù as the start of the command like it would if it had accidentally been triggered. Does anyone know how this happens?
"When I had Amazon Music Unlimited, I could say, ""Alexa, play Marketplace"" and NPR's Kai Ryssdal's baritone voice would play on whatever device I was using at the time -- Echo Dot, iPhone, etc.  But now that I switched to Apple Music, it seems like Siri can't handle requests to play NPR programs. Say it ain't so! Tell me there's a way to access NPR programming on my iPhone using Siri."
"Just ask it- ""Hey Siri, what's the weather in New York, New York?"" Its pronunciation almost makes it sound like ""Newark""."
Is there a fix for Siri reminder call actions? In ios12 when you say ‚Äúremind me to call my wife ‚Äú Siri creates an action with the phone icon that you push and iPhone sets the call. In iOS 13 (for me at least) this helpful feature is gone.  Anybody with the same issue?  Thanks
I have an iPhone 8 version 13.1  Recently in the last few weeks Siri won‚Äôt turn off my alarm. Siri says ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do that right now.‚Äô Or sometimes Siri will say It can‚Äôt do that right now but I will silence alarms.‚Äô  I‚Äôve never had a problem with turning off alarms using Siri before the 13 update. Help?
"Hey everyone,  I'm looking for some help or information on what's the best way to have Siri activate in all my Apple devices, or perhaps just comments on how you use it if you own multiple Apple devices. I own iPhone, Watch and the new Airpods, so I'm not sure if it's worth having Siri on in all of them or if I should stick to iPhone or Watch only.  I guess I'm trying to understand Siri within Apple ecosystem, looking for an efficient way to interact with it but doesn't overlay among devices, or feels redundant.  Thanks for your help."
My nieces name is Nilah (Nye-luh) but Siri pronounces it like Nilla. I‚Äôve done the ‚ÄúSiri you‚Äôre pronouncing Nilah wrong‚Äù twice and corrected him but when I say ‚ÄúCall Nilah‚Äù hell still say ‚ÄúCalling Nilla‚Äù idk what else I can do to try and correct it
"TL;DR Is there a way to change Siri's iOS 13 responses back to or more similar to iOS 12 responses?  It seems they've shortened a lot of Siri's feedback responses with iOS 13. I've noticed it particularly with setting reminders. Siri used to confirm your reminder by repeating it back to you, but no longer does.  iOS 12:  ""Set a reminder at 1730"", ""What would you like me to remind you about?"", ""Pick up dog food"", ""Ok, I've set a reminder 'Pick up dog food' for today at 1730.""   iOS 13:  ""Set a reminder at 1730"", ""What would you like me to remind you about?"", ""Pick up dog food"", ""Ok, I set your reminder for this afternoon.""  I like the fact that Siri would repeat the reminder back to me, because it confirms I spoke properly and Siri understood me. Does anyone have any idea how to turn this feature back on? I've used my Google-foo to no avail, and digging through the *Siri &amp; Search* brings up zilch."
"It‚Äôs incredibly annoying and first started with iOS 13.   I‚Äôd hoped iOS 13.2 would have fixed it, but nope."
"I‚Äôve been using Siri for many years now, dictating voice messages, dictating Reddit posts, dictating emails, asking for directions, you name it. I‚Äôve noticed recently ridiculous errors in dictation, almost like there is no contextual recognition anymore, has anybody else noticed this?   It seems especially bad since I upgraded to an iPhone XR so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs related, I‚Äôve used many different models over the years so I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs some kind of database that needs to be cleared or if they tweak the settings and it just sucks now. Like in this very post, where and I said iPhone XR it wrote iPhone EXR, Shouldn‚Äôt Apple no there isn‚Äôt such a model? I didn‚Äôt even say the letter E! I just said the ladders (letters ffs!!) EXR, but it decides to use Ex as an ex-wife or something."

Is there a counter out there that records how many people have said ‚Äúshut up bitch‚Äù or something similar when Siri activates randomly? Late night thoughts.

"When you go to an app configuration there is this option at the bottom that says ""Use with Ask Siri"". I'm pretty sure that having this on will enable app specific commands with Siri, but there are 3 things that are bothering me:  1) I had to check every app to see if it had this option and manually enable them, why did I never get a popup asking if I wanted to use it with Siri in the first place? It sucks to check every app to see if Siri can work with them;  2) I started to look for this option after I heard that Spotify could be controlled with Siri, but that's one of the few apps that the option was already toggled on. I never accepted a notification to use Siri with Spotify, anyone knows why or how iOS decides which apps should have this option turned on by default?  3) Probably the most important question: Is there a way to know what commands I can say for that specific app?"
Ever since I updated to iOS 13.2 I haven‚Äôt been able to hear Siri when she responds. Anyone now how to fix this?
"For a recent personal project, I needed to invoke Siri from the macOS terminal command line. It's part of a home automation thing, and I wanted my computer to invoke Siri on it's own. Here's how I did it.  Step one: Enable ""Type to Siri"" (System Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Siri). I also changed Siri's keyboard shortcut to ""Press Fn (Function) Space"" (System Preferences &gt; Siri). The other keyboard shortcut options require you to ""Hold"" a key, which can be done, but it makes things a bit trickier.  Step two: install [Cliclick](https://www.bluem.net/en/projects/cliclick/). Cliclick is a great (and free) tool for triggering mouse and keyboard events via the command line.  With that done, I can invoke Siri from the command line with something like this:  `$ cliclick kd:fn kp:space ku:fn w:250 t:""turn on the living room lights"" kp:return`  Going a step further, if you are familiar with [terminal aliases and functions](https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/beginners-guide-to-terminal-aliases-and-functions), you can create a ""siricli"" function:      siricli(){              cliclick kd:fn kp:space ku:fn w:250 t:""$1"" kp:return          }  Open a new terminal window after adding that function, and now you can invoke Siri like this:  `$ siricli ""turn on the living room lights""`"
"Running iOS 13.1.2 and HomePod 12.4, asking Siri to ‚ÄòLove this song‚Äô playing from Apple Music results in an ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand: love this song‚Äù but if I say ‚Äòlike this song‚Äô, she gets it right and marks the song as loved.  Given the wording on AM is ‚Äòloved‚Äô and ‚Äòunlove‚Äô this is pretty confusing.   Happening for anyone else? I have one phone on 13.2 beta."
"I would like to know how you can get Siri to read content and not simply show a list or prompt me to touch the screen. I'm a quadriplegic with [muscular dystrophy](http://muscle.ca/discover-md/what-is-muscular-dystrophy/)  and I find if really difficult to get myself a list of all new streaming media content on services like Netflix or amazon prime, since I last asked Siri?   Currently Siri isn't at all helpful  to me when it displays content on the screen that requires me to touch, tap or otherwise swipe the screen to read the content.   Thoughts?"

Ever since IOS 13 came out I‚Äôve had a huge problem with Siri. I‚Äôll ask her to play a specific song that I don‚Äôt have downloaded on my phone such as ‚Äúthank u next‚Äù by Ariana grande or ‚Äúthere nothing holdin‚Äô me back‚Äù my Shawn mendes and I‚Äôm always met with ‚Äúsure here‚Äôs some *insert artist here* ‚Äúor ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find this song in your music.‚Äù On iOS 12 I did not have this problem. I‚Äôve asked in several different ways like ‚Äúsearch for this song on Apple Music‚Äù and still no help. This is really frustrating especially when I‚Äôm driving and I want to hear a certain song and I‚Äôm met with either music that I don‚Äôt listen to or no music at all.

"So, i have a problem with Siri that i cannot understand. My SO bought an iPhone XR a couple of weeks ago, and i have noticed something peculiar. We both have Hey Siri activated on our own phones, i own an iPhone Xs and they are supposedly trained to respond to our own voices (so i trained mine, she trained hers).   Problem is, when my SO says Hey Siri, she only triggers her phone. But when i say Hey Siri, i trigger both my phone and hers, the Siri screen appears on both of them for a brief second, then after a super short time the chime comes in on one of them that takes my command. It is super annoying because sometimes she is on her phone, browsing the internet, then i come in the room, I say ""Hey Siri"" to my phone so i can control the lights with HomeKit, but instead her phone chimes, and triggers the response. Mine just sits there, and it is annoying because it interrupts her every time. If her phone is not in the room, then my Xs respons just fine, super fast.   So basically, when i ""Hey Siri"", there is a 50/50 chance to trigger both my phone and my SO's phone. We retrained them a couple of times, turned off Hey Siri, even performed a general reset on both phones. Retrained them alone, in different rooms, so no interference there. What is the matter with this? How can we resolve this issue?"
Hi guys! Any chance there's a way to play a new audiobook or continue where you last left off on an audiobook via voice command?
"So on the day of Apple's annual world's biggest announcement, I'm reminded that Siri sux.  Alexa far superior.  Tried to set appointment on MBA three times - response is 'Something's wrong"";  DUH  Try same thing from iPad - Sets up appointment alright - loaded with code like:  Trouble scheduling with {""homophones"";\[{""value"":""John Doe"", confidenceScore"":694.0}  try Alexa set appointment for thursday at six pm with John Doe works fine on exact same calendar.  &amp;#x200B;  Reminds me of how  commoditized Apple products have become.  Used to be one could count on AAPL for reliability and honesty.  Apple replaced my 7s (2-radio phone) with a 7s single radio phone.  I didn't discover it for a year until I went to switch carriers.  Spent 3 visits in apple store with manager, at least 3 cases opened up with Customer relations with no response as promised.  Not even a 'No"".    At one point, the store manager told me that if I had discovered during the warranty period, they would have taken care of it.  SInce when does warranty have to do with a problem with the sale?  This was an accidental switch when the phone was replaced.     This lack of response is not an accident, tho.  So Apple admits there is a problem but refuses to do anything about it.  So now I'm suing them in small claims court.  I hear the Apple legal team needs work.  LOL  I am very happy with AAPL products, but I am not happy with Apple's 'sculdugerous' sales and warranty practices.  I think I'll give the Calif State Attorney General some work by reporting this bait-and-switch  policy.     &amp;#x200B;  So when you're all drooling today over a wide angle lens and better night foto's - jsut remember that when your new phone fails, you will own a lesser device after AAPL does a warranty exchange.  In my experience, this has been the store policy and the (de facto) corporate policy."

"Just needed to vent after reading yet another lousy ""Voice Assistant IQ test"". For the vast majority of my queries, Siri can do the job just as well as Google Assistant, and even sometimes better.  Why? Because I don't care about the King of \[*Country*\] in \[*Obscure Year*\], I care that you can quickly text with good transcription accuracy, manage my reminders + calendar, and manage the few smart gadgets I own.  And this might be anecdotal, but I feel like this is &gt;80% of use cases.  As an example: Google Assistant **still** can't handle the query ""Remind me to do X when I get to work."" Siri handles it just fine - as well as other location reminders. Google Assistant is just confused and keeps asking me ""what time?""  Another example: I trust that when I ask Siri about my schedule, I can get **both** work and personal appointments - not just one. Google Assistant infamously can't handle this - making a Nest Hub schedule view absolutely useless.  Lastly, Siri is also great about recognizing nicknames if you put them in your contacts - Google Assistant picked this up recently, but you have to navigate to a separate menu in the Assistant app, rather than just updating your contacts list.  Kudos to the Siri team for, I think, putting the focus on the right use cases, and not trying to fall for the blogger hype of satisfying every/all queries that a Google could do."
Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. I was having a conversation with my wife this morning about how I need to go get oil to change the motor oil in the car. Five minutes later I get in the car and open Apple maps. The first item on the list was o‚ÄôReilly auto parts. It disturbed me enough to shut as much of Siri as I can. It also got me thinking if anybody puts their phone in a RF protective sleeve. I‚Äôm looking into getting one.
Would anybody have any idea what is causing Siri on my iPhone X on iOS 12.4  volume to be so low but only when invoked with the side button? I‚Äôve checked all of the volumes and they are at 100% and when I use the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù  feature The volume is loud and clear.

"I have ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù , i known how to use it , but i wuold like to have a Siri icon to press ... It is possible ? I don‚Äôt want to use shortcut ... my iPhone is jailbroken and i would prefer a simple link ..."
"I'm setting up my relative's technology, really hoping Siri could help.  He needs to just say ""Hey Siri, Call Bob!"" - and it calls Bob.  He literally can't use his hands so well, I mean the iphone will be by his bedside, plugged into the charger, just waiting for him to speak. He can't press the home button, is what I mean. The phone screen will be black - not even the lock screen.  Any ideas? I bought him an Iphone 6. If that can't do it, can any?  Thanks! It will make a huge difference. Currently he places calls through Alexa with Skype - huge delay, can't really talk to people easily. Hope the Iphone can help."
Guys the 2038problem is wat???im really confused comment to me if you know anything
[Hey Siri](https://youtu.be/mrUX_ZUjrRY)
Out of all the news I read/click on..CNN is probably about 5%   Why on earth would Siri suggest a news source I rarely ever look at?
So I have AirPods and a Bluetooth fan transmitter in my car and when something is playing in my AirPods and get in the car it automatically connects and switches to my car radio. Is there a Siri command to get it to change the audio back to my AirPods?
"ƒ∞ often use ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù at home to turn lights on or off, play music and other such things. My HomePod is in the shop after it got wet, so the only thing in the room is my iPhone.  When it hears the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù it lights up and you can see the Siri wave form on the screen for a second and then it goes away as if another device has taken the request. But there are no other active devices around. My watch is switched off because it was in a startup loop and will cost too much to replace, my MacBook has hey Siri disabled and it‚Äôs lid is closed. There are two other iPhones in the apartment but not even close to within earshot.  ƒ∞ have only noticed this at home. It‚Äôs really bugging me. Anyone have any ideas?"
Barley found out about this little tidbit.  lol
"For capability, and understanding of my questions, Siri is actually so bad.   Apple were first to market, and I was impressed. But now it feels like it‚Äôs been forgotten. Abandoned.   Anyone think it can catch up to or overtake google assistant?"
Siri is worthless for me right now.  I even tried a full phone reset. No help.    It will either do a really good job or it will be a situation where I say a sentence or two and get maybe three words.  üò°
"I have an alexa and I can use my iphone using bluetooth to activate siri shortcuts and have it play music through my iphone but I have to be near my iphone to activate siri. Is there a bluetooth wireless mic I can use with siri that I can place in my living room so I can say ""Hey Siri"" and activate my iphone when it's not with me?"
"Siri always worked great at playing music hands-free in my car. But since I signed up for Apple Music, whenever I ask Siri to play an artist or song, it says ""it looks like you're not connected to cellular data"". I'm not; I don't have unlimited data, and I don't want Siri streaming songs to play. I just want her to play the songs already on my iPhone.  Here's the thing... if I ask her to play a playlist (ie. Hey Siri, play playlist ""Recently Added""), she plays the music.  Help?  Greg"
"I recently learned that if you ask Alexa a question, she can read the answer back to you. When I ask Siri, all she does is say something like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what I found‚Äù and pull up some links. My uncle recently had a stroke, so can‚Äôt really use his phone. However, he can use one hand. If he can somehow have Siri read back to him that would mean the world."
Like the title says Siri‚Äôs voice has changed overnight on my phone 3 times. Have no idea why. From British female to British male. Then when I open the setting to change it back it says its downloading the female voice. Anyone else having this issue?
"Hey everyone  When I play BBC Sounds with Siri on my iPhone SE and ask Siri to pause the radio, it pauses the radio briefly before turning it back on. What do I have to do to make sure the radio stays off using Siri? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Septic"
"‚ÄúHey Siri, I‚Äôm starting CPR‚Äù should at the very least start a beat at the proper CPR compression rate.  As a bonus it could call 911 and use beam forming microphones and/or noise cancelation to allow the user to communicate with dispatch while the beat is still playing."
"Hi, i‚Äôm trying to create short, when I connect to my car Bluetooth in morning it start maps directions to my office. And in the evening when I connect to my car Bluetooth it shows direction to my home."
"I looked up whether Hey Siri works on the iPhone XS online because I was under the impression that it did, although it never works when I try it, not even when the music is very low and gentle. Ours really frustrating but from what I found online it‚Äôs just nota feature on the iPhone X/XS. Very disappointing."
"I LOVE that Siri pulls contact info from the email signatures in my Mail app to guess who is calling/texting, but instead of having to wait for folks to call, one at a time, then saving their contact info, is there a way to just proactively save all that suggested contact info in my Contacts so that I can use it to call/text?"
I need siri shortcut to split video into 30 seconds parts for whatsapp status
I noticed a lot of apps have poor documentation when it comes to what you can say to Siri. Is there a way to find out what commands an app supports
"This really irritates me. Anytime I use Siri (unlocked) it throws the blocking screen back up to confirm what I just told it. A lot of times I‚Äôm using this to add stuff to a list as I look through a page (such as a recipe) so I can keep dictating stuff to Siri.  But nooooo, Siri is going to be ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù by doing a goddamned confirmation screen for every goddamned interaction. I never noticed it before, but the confirm screen is utterly useless when the verbal confirmation is there. Imagine a confirmation screen blocking an order form every time you entered a part of your address.  This should be a configurable option.  Or am I missing something and there‚Äôs a way to stop this?"
I‚Äôm running ios 13 beta 3 and still hasn‚Äôt felt that siri has gotten a better voice. I‚Äôm using the american female voice and when trying to replicate the same question showcased by apple at WWDC i still get the ios 12 voice. Is it working for anyone? Or is it still not activated yet?

"I remember a couple of years ago when Apple announced they were making Siri more proactive, one of the feature was that in a lot of stock apps, you could say ‚ÄúHey Siri remind me of this‚Äù and it would create a reminder based on notes or a Safari page you were looking at. I reminder this feature being broken.   In an effort to save money, I want to move away from Evernote and other productivity apps subscription costs. I just tried using Siri to remind of a note and it didn‚Äôt work ( ‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt remind you about the notes App‚Äù), after I tried it a couple of more times it finally worked.   This is very unreliable, why and is there a fix?"
"I‚Äôve had my iPhone 8 Plus for under a year now (I went with an 8 plus as an upgrade because I wanted a home button, maybe that‚Äôs weird but I needed a home button lol) so as of the past 2 days my battery life has basically just shit out. I‚Äôm watching my battery die as I type this bad. I haven‚Äôt changed anything about how I use my phone and it feels very sudden and strange as I know apple has gotten flack for this before. Could this be an IOS update issue? Is this just apple trying to get me to update? I‚Äôm really not tech savvy but I‚Äôve tried managing the issue in the battery tab but it says everything is working fine. It‚Äôs frustrating to say the least."

Does IOS 13 Siri Neural TTS only available for American accent ? I couldn't notice any difference for British voice.
"Yesterday, I was talking to some friends over dinner about James Spader. One of my friends says, ""The first time I remember seeing James Spader was in an 80s movie called Tuff Turf!"" And then we all laughed, because who the hell ever heard of a James Spader movie called Tuff Turf?  Today, I opened a new Amazon tab and searched for ""cal digit"". I'm considering buying a dock, and I misspelled Caldigit. I got a long list of results including Caldigit products and other USB-C hubs, docks, adapters etc.--all computer gear. Except halfway down the list was a link to rent motherfucking Tuff Turf on Prime Video.  MOTHERFUCKING TUFF TURF! How is that possible unless my phone is listening to me? HOW? By no stretch of the imagination does Tuff Turf have anything to do with ""cal digit"". I have never searched for anything related to Tuff Turf or James Spader. I didn't pull up his IMDB during the conversation or anything remotely like that. Unless somebody can offer a reasonable explanation, I'm turning off Siri and denying microphone access to all apps except the phone and camera.   Oh yeah--I don't have any Amazon apps installed. I don't have Facebook or any other social media apps, no free games, no ad-supported apps whatsoever. All the people at the table had iPhones. We were in a restaurant, so there were no Alexa or Google devices nearby. It makes no sense, and it's too specific to be a coincidence."
"I just upgraded to AirPods 2 and at first I thought summoning Siri via only the AirPods would be a gimmick and not work, but it turns out if I speak louder, in a continuous sentence and without too much external voice she works almost every time.   I also find I‚Äôm using Siri WAY more now. It‚Äôs so convenient asking her to play playlists or respond in various chat apps via dictation. I love leaving the iPhone in the pocket of some bag and not worry about what‚Äôs on the screen as Siri can be commanded to reply and respond to a ton of stuff.   Has that been your experience with AirPods 2 + Siri as well? Please do share! üòä"
"I dare you to! Trust me, you won‚Äôt regret itüòÅ"
"Hi! Just the other day when my mom was setting up a timer on Siri it started saying some pretty weird things. I‚Äôm from Sweden so the translations might be a bit off, but it started saying something by the likes of ‚ÄúShit, I don‚Äôt know how to do that‚Äù she then tried to set the timer again but Siri just returned with the word ‚Äúfuck‚Äù.  If anyone has any ideas on what might have caused it and how to fix it, that would be very appreciated. It came out of nowhere and we both got a bit shaken up."
"So I was messing around with the settings and I don‚Äôt know what I did but now I have to press the ‚Äòsiri‚Äô symbol? every time i want to say something new to siri. Sorry if its already been asked, I tried searching but I couldn‚Äôt find an answer."
"I try to use ‚Äòremind me when I get home‚Äô and the reminder is set, but Siri doesn‚Äôt seem to recognise that I am at my house when I‚Äôm at my address.  I live in a high rise in a busy neighbourhood, in Hong Kong. Maybe it gets confused?! So, as a workaround I‚Äôd want it to remind me when it connects to my home wifi. Would solve the issue. Does anyone know of it is possible?"
"When I say ""Dislike this song"" to Siri, it skips to the next song but doesn't mark the song as Disliked."
Is there a way to stop Siri from muting the volume playing on YouTube in Chrome when I ask Siri a question?
"European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese are not the same and there are a lot of differences speaking wise other than the accent. So why is there not eu Portuguese siri? I try and try and try to speak to her and she doesn't understand me so I just gave up and not I have to use it in English.  And also does anyone know how am I supposed to ask for assistance? Apple's website is sooo confusing, the support part, and even when I try to contact a person it still gives me no option for siri problems... I don't get it"
"Siri has her uses, but this one thing totally sucked:  ""Text David Arriving at nine fifteen AM""  iPhone text feedback shows the entire verbal message is received.  Siri replies, ‚ÄúOK, I‚Äôll send this‚Äù ‚ÄúArriving At‚Äù  It‚Äôs like she literally reads the message, thinks of a creative way to butcher it without looking like it‚Äôs 100% Siri‚Äôs fault, then offers to send garbage to said recipient.   This is not an isolated event. Simple messages turning into eclectic wastes of time occur once per day. In her defense, I send approximately 100 verbal Siri commands per day, she‚Äôs not TERRIBLE, but she has this niche weakness that makes me wish I called the person instead."
"Sorry if this has been answered but i searched and didn't find anything...  I like to use the spotlight (now called siri suggestions) search menu to see the eight suggested apps from siri. I use a relatively small number of apps and the Siri suggestions are useful to me. But when i type in the search field i don't want suggestions for web search, which i find useless yet it appears above the suggested apps.   So when i type ""red"" in the search field i only want to see the icon for my Reddit app but i don't want to see the five suggested web search terms for ""red sox,"" ""red lobster"" etc. above it. But when i turn that off the list of eight commonly used apps disappears too.   Seems like the only option to turn off web search suggestions is to also turn off app suggestions.   Anyone know a way to do this?"
My cousins is a quadriplegic with muscular dystrophy. He has been enjoying controlling his iPhone with Siri but Siri seems to have some difficulty doing certain things.  For example: I was able to sync my audible account to his phone and transfer a bunch of audio books to his phone successfully. But he can't seems to get Siri to open an audiobook consistently. Anyone know how to fix this?

"I often wind up walking around my house while listening to a podcast through my phone's speaker. When I activate siri, it will catch the last couple words of the podcast, which inevitably messes up whatever instruction I give it.  Is there anyway around this other than always pausing my podcast before activating siri? It seems ridiculous that this hasn't been solved by apple."
"I just switched from a note 9 to the XS. Every morning when I leave for work I would say ""Hey Google, Play the news"" and it would cycle through about 10 different news reels each about 3 or 4 minutes long. You could set which ones you wanted in this list. When I say ""Hey Siri, Play the news"", it responds with something like, ""Now playing CNBC News, if you'd like to switch to fox news or any other then say 'switch to fox news""  &amp;#x200B;  What I'm looking to do is just play continuously one after the other similar to how the Google version works.

"[iPhone 7+, iOS 12.2]  When driving, I try to obey the hands-free law in Georgia.  I leave Waze open which keeps the phone unlocked.  Occasionally, I'll have the need to send a text message.    **In the good old days** (up until the 12.2 update I think) I could just say:  &gt; Me: ""Hey Siri, new text message to John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt mobile"" &gt;  &gt; Siri: ""Ok, what would you like to say to John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt?

"When I ask Siri to call some one on speaker phone, she will reply ‚ÄúCalling John Doe, mobile, on speaker.‚Äù And then call them not on speaker.

This bug has been there since the beginning and I have reported it, since the beginning, to apple but it‚Äôs still there. No big deal, but annoying and surprising.
 
 I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a language setting thing (would be interesting to know if it is there also for other languages).
 
 So, I noticed years back that when I make an appointment with Siri for, let‚Äôs say tomorrow at 08:30, I can see on the feedback text on my iPhone screen that the time is correct (08:30), but still Siri makes the appointment for 20:30. I have to say ‚Äú08:30 in the morning‚Äù, which is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but still annoying.  After all, the point with 24 hours setting is the difference between 08:30 and 20:30 and we are talking about Apple here, not a one-person-developer.
 
 There seems to be a turning point at 09:00. From 09:00 it works but before that, Siri books appointments in the evening.
 
 Just sent another bug feedback to apple. I‚Äôm sure they will thank me :)"
"So this has to be one of the most frustrating ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of the iPhone to me. I actively use the do not disturb while drive feature that is activated by movement speed as my car does not have Bluetooth.   I keep my phone plugged in to my car via a lightning cable that charges and outputs audio to my aux on the stereo.  However by saying ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù she won‚Äôt respond unless I hold the home button.   This seems to defeat the entire functionality of trying to keep the phone hands free. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating since I commute quite a bit for work.   On top of this, when Siri is activated she only talks to me over the phone speakers even though the aux is plugged in. I can‚Äôt seem to find any setting to change output device for Siri.   These two things seem to be pretty silly oversights.  Unless someone here can shed some light on my issues here."
"My geometry teacher just said thank you to siri and she replied with ""You're Welcome, Daddy"""
"I love having the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù function on my phone. I use it quite a bit when I‚Äôm driving for work to respond to messages or call people.   When I am in my office, I have to keep my cell phone nearby on my desk as some clients only contact me this way. However, while I never say ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù during the workday, my phone will sometimes think I‚Äôve said it. It happens frequently when I‚Äôm leaving a voicemail for anyone named ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried to speak clearly, but it hasn‚Äôt really helped.  So, as the title of my post states, I‚Äôm wondering if there is any way to have Siri auto-disable between certain hours of the day. YES I could manually do this every day, but if there is a way this could be done automatically that would be great. Doing it manually, everyday, seems like a tiny pain in the ass and I‚Äôm likely to forget.  Any suggestions appreciated! TIA!"
"Ever the optimist, I alway give Siri the benefit of the doubt. Today, I gave Siri what I thought was a softball:  Me: ""Hey, Siri, Directions to Max's Tavern""  Siri: ""Here's directions to Circle K""  Me: Hmm, maybe I spoke to fast.  Me, in my best TV announcer voice: ""Hey, Siri, Directions to Max's Tavern""  Siri: ""Which Circle K did you want?""  Me, screaming: ""How the FUCK does FUCKING ""Max's Tavern"" sound anything like ""Circle K!!!???""  At least Siri get ""Open Google App"" almost all the time."
"Hi all! I hope this is ok to post here. I just launched my first iOS app, [Just Timers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-timers/id1453573845?mt=8), which lets you create multiple timers and assign Siri Shortcut phrases to them for later use.   Just Timers is the missing timers app for iOS. Tired of only being able to set one timer? Hate not being able to name or reuse timers, let alone control them with your voice? With Just Timers you can not only have as many timers as you want at the same time, but you can also use Siri to control them! Assign Siri Shortcut phrases for various timers to make things easy to remember.   Some examples:  -	Create a reusable timer for green tea, then assign the phrase ‚Äútea timer‚Äù or ‚Äústart tea‚Äù. Use the trigger phrase to restart the timer any time you need it. -	Making tater tots for the kids? ‚ÄúTater tot timer‚Äù is fun and easy to remember! -	Need to take medication every few hours? ‚ÄúTook my meds‚Äù to restart the timer for the next duration. -	Create timers named by duration, then simply use a trigger phrase like ‚Äú20 minute timer‚Äù to summon it. -	Doing laundry? ‚ÄúStart the wash‚Äù will count down until it‚Äôs done.  If you love the Shortcuts app, not only will timers get donated to show up in the Shortcuts app, but I also have built-in support for x-callback-urls, so you can create your own shortcuts that interact with the app. I've documented the supported functions in detail [over here](https://justtimers.app/help/shortcuts/). I also created a Shortcut [available here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4fc4a164b2514f128793ffc35e85fac7) for creating new timers completely hands free (your phone does need to be unlocked or use Face ID to unlock due to iOS limitations).   I'd appreciate any feedback, thank you!  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-timers/id1453573845?mt=8"

"So when you ask Siri ( in French) about who is the Algerian President (which is Bouteflika), Siri says it‚Äôs Macron (the Current president of France)...  This is interesting because Algeria was colonized for 132 years by France and Algeria managed to get independence in 1962. Algerians tend to think there is some ‚Äúshady agreements‚Äù with France up to this day justified by the French involvement in many Algerian matters even after 60 years of independence. So what can be causing this error?   I have to mention that when using Siri in English, it gives the right answer (Bouteflika)."

It feels completely unnatural to switch language just to utter a simple question or command.  &amp;#x200B;  I quite understand that making Siri for all languages is an impossible task. However I believe there is a middle ground ‚Äì a simple automated translation from the native language to English is enough. I saw few bilingual children that were using same approach ‚Äì somebody asked them a question in one language and they responded in another. It works.  &amp;#x200B;  There is a Dictation support for my language, so transcribing my speech into text can be handled by the system. Siri can translate between some pairs of languages, but unfortunately not mine. However if it could, there are all ingredients in place to enable this kind of interaction.  &amp;#x200B;  What do you think? Would you use it?"
I want to make Siri play the previous track by saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rewind time‚Äù  Can someone help me out?
"I have a shortcut set up to give me the weather, read me the news through RSS feeds, give me current cryptocurrency and stock prices, then finally play a music playlist on shuffle.   The whole purpose for this app is for it to run after a double tap on my AirPod having everything spoken from Siri from the time I leave my house to the time I pull into work. The issue I‚Äôm having is when I try this, the shortcut will restart itself with the the weather and normally starts over around the RSS feeds. I‚Äôve already tried to cut some out and lower the quantity on them but no luck. The odd thing is it‚Äôll complete the whole way through if it‚Äôs opened in the app. Anyone else know a fix for this issue?"
"Like if I had a message from telegram which I didn‚Äôt want to be read and a notification from SoundCloud for example, could I ask her this and have her list the notifications while the phone is locked but not actually reading the contents themselves?"

Does anyone know of an app like [LiveFrame](LiveFrame by Attibo https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liveframe/id860372559?mt=8) that works with Siri shortcuts? I‚Äôd really like to be able to launch my slideshow by voice. 
"Just got this lamp.   https://i.imgur.com/SXb5Bhk.jpg  Setting it up with HomeKit was really easy and it works well except I can't figure out how to turn it from colour back to the really  bright, warm white mode, either with Siri or with HomeKit.   I have to open the Mi Home app or tap the top button on the lamp itself to do that.   I tired turning it warm white and asking Siri what colour it is. She says the colour is ""40W Tungsten""   Tried telling Siri to change the lamp to this colour but that doesn't work.  Has anyone else figured this out yet? "
"The custom voice commands I use for Siri to track my work hours (using the app ""Toggl Track"")  just suddenly stopped working - anyone else experience somthing similar?     I  use the shortcuts every day to start and stop a timer, but when I tried  ""start work"" this morning, Siri just responded ""I can't see an app for  that. You need to download one"". Also, I was asked to unlock the phone first, which the two shortcuts has never necessitated.     I already have an app for that. It's the same app as it was yesterday?      I  tried deleting the shortcuts and setting them up again, same phrases,  but I still getting the same error message. It seems my other shortcuts  can still be voice controlled.   The shortcuts still work manually, but it was just very easy with voice.  Any suggestions of what might be the issue?"

"Hey! I‚Äôm using Siri for my videos. (German language) But out of nowhere, Siri sounds like a broken Roboter. Yesterday her voice sounded pretty natural and all that. (Apple translator).

"They already have English, Irish, and Australian. How did Scottish not make the most recent cut?"
"This was definitely one of the things Siri could do early on, I made reservations using only Siri several times, but now when I try to do it all I get are generic Maps results.  Anyone know what the magic incantation is these days to book a table at a restaurant?  I'm assuming it requires a third party app like OpenTable or Yelp but I have OT installed and still can't get it to work."
Siri only indicates ‚Äúadded to shopping list‚Äù.  Is there anyway to have the item repeated for confirmation?  I know Alexa does this.
Are we all using the beta version of iOS or what? Why does Siri suck (more) all the sudden?
Hi I have LGb9 tv and would like to be able to turn off the screen with siri. (Only screen not tv for listening to Spotify)Is it possible?  I can turn off Tv because i am using Broadlink remote however broadlink standard remote do not have this button. Also to do it with standard lg remote we have to press multiple buttons.

"After EVERY update on my iPhone, Apple BEGS me to turn on the always listening Siri thing. I have the option to either ""turn on now"" or ""setup later in settings"", in a very [DarkPattern](https://www.darkpatterns.org/)-like way of making the ""setup later in settings"" text smaller, but also not giving me a ""setup never ever ever ever ever ever"" option.  Once I swipe it away, I'm greeted with a red 1 on Settings, and I have to repeat the steps above.  THEN I also have to reenable dictation on my keyboard.  I get that this isn't the worst thing in the world, far from it. But this seems like it must be deliberate on Apple's part. Does anyone else have this issue? Why would ""No, I don't want Siri listening all the time"" turn off dictation if it wasn't intentional?  /Rant"
"Siri's response to ""What is 0√∑0?"" recently changed.  Old response:    ‚ÄúImagine that you have zero cookies and you split them evenly among zero friends. How many cookies does each person get?

And Cookie Monster is sad that there are no cookies, and you are sad that you have no friends.‚Äù  New Response:  ""Imagine that you have zero cookies and you split them evenly among zero friends.

hi guys so when i tell siri ‚Äúgo back‚Äù or ‚Äúrestart‚Äù or something she always hears ‚Äúcall _____‚Äù then she starts to call people and it‚Äôs so annoying because i can‚Äôt stop it before she calls. so my question is is there a way for siri to ask you ‚Äúare you sure you want to call ____‚Äù then i could say no instead of her going ahead and doing it. i‚Äôve looked in settings and there‚Äôs no setting for it
Example:  I give Siri the command and she gives me one of her having trouble responses.  I immediately open Homekit and see that the command was executed or ... that I can easily execute it with a press.  Isn't Siri executing the command thru Homekit?
No Siri I mean mom. She only started doing that recently. And helpful advice?
"Hi friends!  Years ago (in 2016 maybe?) I would wish Siri a good night before going to bed. Quite often, she would read me the Goodnight Moon poem (inspired by the book) that includes the following phrases: ‚Äúgoodnight moon‚Äù, ‚Äúgoodnight balloon‚Äù, ‚Äúgoodnight room‚Äù, etc. I haven‚Äôt been able to get her to do it in a long time but I remember it making me really happy and would love to hear it again :( I remember it happening every once in a while, as her answers are randomised, so I‚Äôd have to ask a few times.  I can‚Äôt find a video of it online but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve seen one at some point.  Thanks in advance :)  Edit: I found a [screenshot](https://aminoapps.com/c/virtual-space/page/blog/goodnight-siri/w7Io_uWEz52Jkbx1jZVl37bNejg3q6 ) online, so that‚Äôs proof I didn‚Äôt make it all up."
"My dads trying to use siri on his iPhone XR but the search results don‚Äôt appear even though Siri still says ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what I found.‚Äù I have the same iPhone as him and compared the settings because mine works, but nothings different. Any reason for this happening?"
"Hello,  I've been waiting for a while now to get my hands on a HomePod mini (they're not sold in Norway and thus hard to get). I want to get one solely for the purpose of using Hey Siri to control my home. However, I recently remembered that most iPads and iPhones support Hey Siri while plugged into power. I tried it on an old iPad 4 I had lying around and it worked! Only problem being that it is incredibly slow, to the point where I find it to be unreliable.   So, rather than paying a ridiculous premium to get my hands on a HomePod mini right now (they sell for around $230 used in Norway) I'm considering just getting a used iPad or iPhone and hide it in a bookshelf. However, does anyone have experience with what device is the cheapest one I can get my hands on that has a reliable and responsive Hey Siri? And how the ability to pick up the voice is compared to a HomePod? I've heard that the original HomePod has a very impressive range, something that is absolutely not the case for my iPad 4.  Also, I know that while the HomePod mini supports multiple voices an iPad or iPhone only supports one. So, if I were to hide two devices in my bookshelf (each configured for mine and my wife's voice), has anyone tested if that works or do they just confuse one another?"
"Idk if this is a new function but when I call Siri, I don‚Äôt receive back the ‚Äúhmm hmm‚Äù or ‚Äúah ah‚Äù   I need to turn off the iPhone to make it possible again.   You‚Äôre wondering ‚Äúwhy you need that?‚Äù Only cause when Siri confirms with a sound then I know I can talk even if I‚Äôm in the shower üöø   Anyway, there‚Äôs a solution?  Hey Siri and all other things are already enabled"

Come on, Apple.  ~~Used to be, if it was 2 PM, I could  say, ""Wake me up at 3,"" and Siri would set it for 3 PM. Now, Siri sets  it for 3 AM the next day.~~  Now,  when I ask Siri, ""What time is my alarm,"" she replies, ""You alarm is set  for tomorrow at midnight,"" but I have no active alarm at that time.

"Hi folks,  I have some shortcuts setup for AirBnb guests. They have multiple ways they can control them (Remote for Philips Hue, for example). I also have a robot vacuum, thermostat and smart lock. The easiest way for guests to control everything is through Siri on the iPad.  The obvious problem here is that Siri doesn't recognize new voices so it doesn't always work smoothly for the guests. I've tried the Toggle On, Toggle Off but then it always sends me back through setup.     Wondering if there's some sort of workaround for this so that Siri on this specific iPad can recognize all voices?"
"I am using iPhone 11 iOS 14.4 and after updating my system, Siri started to act weird. While I was listening music I called her with ""Hey Siri"" she responded ""MPR=72?"" just like that and then I continued for example ""Call my Mom"" she made me wait for 20 seconds tried over and over again then said "" There's no one registered name Mom "" tried several time with different person names but it just doesn't work. Asked her the weather like very simple commands she is trying to process then fails immediately. Found some weird reports recently about this situation I guess I am not the only one who having problems with Siri nowadays, I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this situation?"
"I have a tech question in regards to Siri no longer making a sound when activated.  Starting the past few days Siri no longer makes a sound when it activates, which makes it awkward to use if I‚Äôm not looking directly at my screen to see if the icon pops up.  When I hold down the button at the top of my iPad the icon pops up but there‚Äôs no activation chime sound. When I use ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù either with or without my Bluetooth headphones there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù or ‚ÄúUh huh?‚Äù indicating it‚Äôs active and listening. This really makes it awkward to use since I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs activated or not without looking at the screen and I‚Äôm wondering is this a glitch or is there some setting somewhere that might be causing this or is this typically what is supposed to happen after using Hey Siri for a few weeks? It‚Äôs seems to have started after I used Hey Siri while listening to music with Bluetooth headphones. Thank you."
"First is how do I make Siri read the weather forecast, everything I can find only brings my phone to the weather app instead of having Siri read it so how can I do that?  My second question, is there a way to make it so my music doesn‚Äôt pause when Siri is talking? I have a song playing in the background and the way it is now is fine but I would like it more if the music only turned down a bit or just continued playing"

"This has me a little freaked out, I won't lie. For the first time just ten minutes ago, I was watching a YouTube video and someone said something that sounded similar to ""Siri"", and it activated Siri on my MacBook. The thing is, this has never happened before: I didn't think internal computer audio could trigger Siri, much less when it's going through AirPods. What is going on here? Am I wrong that this is abnormal? I replayed that part of the video several times and I can confirm that it's the video activating Siri."
"My girlfriends alarm was going off on her iPhone (we aren‚Äôt connected with accounts in any way) and I said ‚ÄúHey Siri, Turn off alarm‚Äù as a joke and my phone‚Äôs Siri responded that is turned off a nearby devices alarm.

"I've been playing around with Siri, and I actually don't know a lot of the features with the latest iOS release so I just wanted to ask what are some of your favorite Siri features and what are some things you would like to see Apple tackle in the next iOS release?"
So I‚Äôm trying to show my neighbor how to use hands free in his car to make a call. He has a Sony aftermarket radio and when you press the microphone to say who you want to call and it will say ‚Äúcalling‚Äù but looking at the phone it pops up their number at the bottom and you have to press it on the phone before it actually calls which defeats the whole purpose of hands free. Is there anyway to make it automatically call without having to press it on the phone as well?
"I‚Äôm currently using iPhone and iPad, most irritating problem I encounter is that when I call Siri, it‚Äôs always wrong device responding. I keep my phone away from my study table.  Only if they add such feature to rename assistant on different devices, it would help correct device to respond.  Do tell if there is a already existing solution to this problem."
"Can anyone please provide me with some information about using the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù feature? I realize Apple uses some pretty impressive technology when it comes to keeping your privacy, like how Touch ID works. But I can‚Äôt seem to find much about how ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù works. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
"Hey folks.  In previous versions of iOS, you could add a custom phrase to a shortcut by tapping ‚ÄúAdd to Siri‚Äù, from the details menu if I remember correctly. I can‚Äôt seem to find the option now on iOS 14. I know that you can say ‚ÄúHey Siri, [shortcut name]‚Äù, but I think it would be better with a custom phrase.  Thanks in advance."
"""Hey Siri, play the song 'Summer Girl'""  This is a song that's  in my library. It's been played by me many times. So why did Siri give me a different song called ""Summer Girl"" by a band that I've never ever listened to?  ""Hey Siri, play 'Rikki Don't Lose That Number'""  This is a Steely Dan song that's in my library. I've listened to it a lot. I have a ton of Steely Dan in my library. So why did Siri give me a COVER VERSION of the song by a band that I've never listened to? Putting aside that it's a song that's in my library, I'm assuming that the original version is way more popular than some obscure cover - why would the latter be the first choice for Siri to cue up?  Anyone else find that Siri isn't so swift when it comes to giving you the most logical result?"
"Below are a few use cases where Siri is in my opinion - just stupid. What is worse, the assistant seems not to be able to do things it used to do before just fine. Besides having a laugh, any input is welcome (for example if I missed something that needs to be allowed in the settings, or if another command works for you)  Battery status: in the past I was able to ask Siri about battery status on different devices I own, the command ‚Äúhow‚Äôs the battery on the/my watch/AirPods/phone‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the status of the battery on the/my watch/AirPods/phone‚Äù worked just fine. Every now and then I even got a funny answer like ‚Äúit‚Äôs at 100%. Overachiever.‚Äù (this one I really find funny). Now, Siri points me to apple.com for info about battery stats for different products, that is for both iterations of the question, even if I‚Äôm careful to say ‚Äúmy‚Äù instead of ‚Äúthe‚Äù.  Calling people: my wife is ethnically Chinese and has a Chinese name - and since long time ago this is how I have her listed in my contacts. But because if Siri, I set her ‚Äúphonetic first name‚Äù to what she has on her passport (corresponds to the two characters of her given name), ‚Äúlearned‚Äù how to pronounce this ‚Äúas if‚Äù in English and used to call her via Siri (again!) just fine - until recently when Siri decided to stop comprehending that name (every time says things like ‚Äúcould you say that again‚Äù ‚Äúwhom should I call‚Äù ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get that‚Äù, or the like). The dumbest thing is that when I tell Siri to redial my last call, she does that and says her name in exactly the same way I tried few seconds before but to no avail - how on earth is it not working when I say that? +btw I‚Äôve seen people on YouTube videos say ‚ÄúHey Siri, pick up/hang up‚Äù, this never worked for me, no idea why.  Forwarding: Siri apparently can‚Äôt forward a command back to phone, even if explicitly told to do so. HomePod overtakes any command when it can hear me (and gosh it can hear me even when whispering! talking about the mini) but if it‚Äôs something that can be done only on phone (e.g. turning off the flashlight), Siri will just say ‚Äúsorry can‚Äôt do it here‚Äù. But even if I try and ask to turn off the flashlight ‚Äúon the phone‚Äù, the assistant refuses. I guess this is deemed to be a security thing but common - can‚Äôt even turn off the flashlight? (If you wonder about the use case: since covid, when I come back home I try not to touch stuff including light switches before washing my hands, don‚Äôt own any smart home appliances, but since I have rash/allergies I try limiting using hot water/soap, so before I wash hands I try to take out and sort all things that need to be sanitized with wipes - usually put them on the floor, put away ‚Äúdirty‚Äù shoes and coat, and during this time the flashlight is on so that I can see things, the ‚Äúdirty‚Äù phone rests against the wall, and after I wash my hands, if I‚Äôm not yet ready to wipe the phone and want to do other things first, I‚Äôd like to turn the flashlight off without touching it just yet...well turns out I can‚Äôt)  Currency conversion on HomePod: this is resolved already but for some time conversion (data from yahoo.com) worked only on the phone but Siri refused to do this on the HomePod - no idea why, luckily it works now  Can‚Äôt do AND logic: this is my longstanding complaint, if two commands are not contradictory and indeed can be carried out one by one in the order that the user said them (connected with AND), the assistant should be able to carry these out in sequence. (the use case: I like to take long walks, even in winter with a cap over my head and thick gloves on my hands. But before I leave home, I‚Äôd like to say ‚Äúbye‚Äù on transparency, and after closing the door I‚Äôd like to say ‚Äúturn on noise cancellation AND continue playback/playing podcasts/music‚Äù, well, I have to call ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù twice in a row, which makes me feel like an idiot)"

"Hi guys,  Been having this issue a while now. Whenever I ask Siri to call a contact called Ashlee, it always says ‚Äúdid you mean Ashlee?‚Äù. Every time!   It used to be fine but it changed a few weeks back and I can‚Äôt understand why. I‚Äôm saying the name as clearly as I can.   Have anyone else had this issue?  All help appreciated!"
"It used work if I remember correctly.  The issue is when I ask ""Hey, Siri, call my wife"" Siri says who is your wife. so I name ABC, then Siri says ok, I will remember ABC as your wife. Then I ask ""hey, Siri, call my wife"" right after, sometimes it will call her. but later, or next day, when I ask same phrase, it's back to one. asking me who is my wife.  I put my wife info as my spouse in my contact and I even see her name registered as wife as well.  Has there been a change?"
"Hi All,    I have multiple versions of the same song downloaded to my iPhone.  Some of these alternate versions are acoustic, some live, etc.  I have the songs differentiated by the title, e.g., Ants Marching vs Ants Marching (acoustic).  Previously, I was able to say, ""Hey Siri, play Ant's Marching Acoustic"" and it would play the correct one.  Now despite the fact that Siri is hearing and correctly interpreting ""acoustic"", it plays the non-acoustic one.  This has only been happening in the last few weeks and I haven't changed anything in my library.  Any thoughts or workarounds for this so I can get it to play the right version (without naming the songs in my library and realizing a lot of these acoustic or live versions don't have album information associated with them.)  Thanks!"
"After 2 days of my new iPhone I now saw, that Siri uses Google as her Search Engine for Results.   Am I able to change that? I don't want her to use Google. Why can't she use DuckDuckGo etc. instead?   Afai looked I didn't found a solution in Settings."
Can i add custom commands to siri? Ex: hey siri undo  (Undo last action)
"Hi I was wondering if there was a way to say ""hey siri, play music"" and then have siri execute this command: ""shuffle my liked songs playlist on spotify"". Its such a pain to say that every time I wanna shuffle my music and would be nice if I can alias that command. I know Alexa has this feature does Siri?"
"I have an an automation set to turn off the light and turn on the fan if I say ‚ÄúHey Siri good night‚Äù she used to never give voice feedback when given this command, but has recently started replying with ‚ÄúThe scene is set. Good night.‚Äù Is there any way to turn this response off? It‚Äôs really annoying to have her respond, especially if the volume of HomePod was left on a loud setting."

"Sorry if this question has been posed before. I see others posting screenshots where Siri is compact and just a circle at the bottom. When I activate Siri using Hey Siri or the side button on my phone, it‚Äôs the older style where it takes up my entire screen. What am I doing wrong? A setting I have messed up?  In USA here. Using iPhone 12 Pro Max on iOS 14.3."
"Hey everyone, newbie here. I am native French speaker &amp; I would like to know how to activate Siri in your languages/Country ?   In French, we say ¬´¬†Dis Siri¬†...¬ª which can be translate by ¬´¬†Tell me Siri ...¬†¬ª  Have a good day"
"I've tried searching for this but haven't had much luck.  When I try to use the share button in an app (safari, photos, reddit), Siri is recommending my contacts to send a message using the message app.  For some of the contacts, when I click the siri suggestion to send a message to them user, it is defaulting to sending a message as an SMS message (dreaded green text).  I have to delete their name from the address bar and retype their name and only then does it come up as an iMessage user.  These users are using iPhones and I have been sending messages using iMessage forever.  Does anyone know how to fix this bug?"
"Is there any way to ask my phone how much time is left on the timer I set on my homepod in the kitchen?  Everything I tried so far (""How much time is left on the kitchen timer"", ""how much time is left on my homepod timer"", ""do I have any timers running"", etc) hadn't worked."
Does anyone else have a problem using ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù? I feel like it only recognizes my voice like 50% of the time. I use an iPhone 11
"When you ask Siri for your update, is there a way to modify the information??"
"Maybe I‚Äôm running, maybe I‚Äôm washing dishes: but the goes off with a persistent chime in my ear. I want to make it stop using Siri, but can‚Äôt.  I‚Äôve tried saying things like ‚Äúhey Siri shut up‚Äù ‚Äúhey Siri I got it‚Äù but after a vapid dialogue with Siri, the alarm continues. I think this is a new bug since the iOS 14 update.   If you have a simple way to tell Siri to make the timer stop ringing, you can make my every say .05% better."
If I say ‚Äúhello all caps my name is John all caps off‚Äù.    The sentence reads hello MY NAME IS JOHN OFF
"Siri will puse after receiving a command. I will say ‚ÄúHey Siri, play previous track.‚Äù And Siri says ‚ÄúOkay, going back.‚Äù and then doesn‚Äôt actually go back.. it gets stuck on this part. The little Siri color thing just keeps spinning, but it doesn‚Äôt do the actual command. Siri will hear and respond to my commands, but then gets stuck ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù it??"
"In my HomeKit home, I‚Äôve invited people (my spouse) and when they use Siri to control my home, she tells them ‚Äúsetting the scene.‚Äù If the same command is given to Siri three or more times, she might execute some or all of the automation(s). I‚Äôm trying to get my spouse on board with HomeKit, but this hiccup is making it difficult. HomeKit commands work for me ~97% of the time. For my spouse it works ~20% of the time. How can I increase stability for users?"
"My Siri devices no longer react correctly to ""Change the Bedroom (or any room) to red/white/whatever color"" and instead gives me a response of ""Sorry I couldn't find anything like that for your Bedroom"" or something like that.  This is basically a regression of something Siri has been doing in my home for ages, so does anyone know why this might have changed or have dealt with this themselves?   Thanks in advance."
"I activated Siri to use it when I drive my car. But before I can interact, for example ‚Äúsend a message to X via Y‚Äù the phone needs to be unlocked. To unlock it I have to take it in my hand which is forbidden where I live.   So far, I have not found a solution. Is it possible to unlock certain commands without the requirement to unlock the phone?  Btw: I use an iPhone XS"
"For a while now, Siri responds way too slow or just fails to respond at all while connected to Wi-Fi. However, I can turn it off and she's lightening fast. It's definitely not my wifi too because I can't replicate the issue anywhere else and I've tested my speed every single time and its over 200 mb. Has anyone else encountered this issue?"
"There is a distinct difference between apologising and saying/being sorry.  Siri is a artificial intelligence, should Siri feel, the it can be sorry, but if it can‚Äôt, it inevitably is manipulating societies into Apple‚Äôs standards of social etiquette."
i keep on aaying hey siri to siri but it keeps on saying that ‚Äú siri didnt quite get that by the way ive got an iphone 12 if you was wondering please let me know beacuse ive been up from 7am trying to get thus to work and im about to give up so please.
"Hi, sorry if this has already been posted a million times but idk what to search. I‚Äôm doing a shortcut to make mono audio turn on (so I don‚Äôt lose sound when I‚Äôm listening with one headphone). I have it set up to turn on, just a single-‚Äúline‚Äù command that goes to settings, but don‚Äôt know how to make it turn back off. If you couldn‚Äôt tell, I‚Äôm a total beginner, so the easier the better :)"
"Without fail, Siri will stop responding to ""Hey, Siri"" after my shower, and I cannot imagine why.  I have tested this by asking Siri for the time hands-free before getting into the shower, which works, and then doing so afterwards, which doesn't (or for that matter, any request).   Once I manually trigger Siri by holding the side button, it will respond to ""Hey, Siri"" again, but hey, I'm dripping wet wrapped up in a towel, I don't want to touch my phone just yet, this is when hands-free should work!  Is it a temperature thing? Humidity? Did all the water/fan sounds put it into some mode I don't know about? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  iPhone 12 Pro, iOS 14.3"
"hello!  i am new to the iphone (from android) and loving it. a weird thing i noticed though is that when i asked siri to call a restaurant (which it does recognize the name of), it said it‚Äôs not in my contacts. so i added it to my contacts and then of course it worked... but is it not possible to just have siri call a business that is not in your contacts? google assistant can do it."
It‚Äôs extremely annoying when your just trying to get directions to a place of business from Siri really quickly and your having to wait forever while she goes on a whole spiel about the store! If I wanted to know that information I‚Äôd look it up my damn self. I don‚Äôt need her dictating out a bunch of info I don‚Äôt need or want when I‚Äôm just trying to get directions real quick!
"I‚Äôve had a look around the settings, however is there any-other way to get Siri attention, instead of saying ‚Äò‚Äôhey‚Äô‚Äô beforehand?"
"So I was just sitting here watching an MKBHD video about the new HomePod Mini on my iPhone, and at one point he said ‚ÄúHey, Siri‚Äù, to which my iPad responded with the little Siri icon.   However, the icon went away immediately, even though it heard the magic phrase, so I thought that maybe Siri has gotten an update to block out unknown voices in iOS/iPadOS?  Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but it literally went away as fast as it appeared. No ‚Äúhmm?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan you say that again?‚Äù type of thing from Siri or anything."
I was speaking to my mates about how stupid it is that the iPhone 12 doesn‚Äôt come with a plug and I said other stuff about the aux port and that its sh*t that they are taking stuff away and charging the same.And out of no where Siri says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not nice‚Äù I didn‚Äôt activate it and it was atleast 2 foot away from me .....: Explanation????
"I wish it could make communicating with people easier, how about you?"
"Sadly I don‚Äôt have video evidence of this and it‚Äôs the first time i‚Äôve ever seen it happen. Hopefully I‚Äôm not losing it in the head.  I asked my HomePod for the hours of a business here in Austin. I said: ‚ÄúHey Siri, when does East Austin Succulents close?‚Äù When i said that i did get a little held up on the word ‚ÄúAustin‚Äù because it‚Äôs been a crazy day and i‚Äôm tired. She responded: ‚ÄúEast Austs... Sorry. I‚Äôll try again. East Austin Succulents closes at...‚Äù  Either it‚Äôs completely random to make her sound more human, or Apple has taught her to stutter when she hears a user stutter. I am not sure though as it just happened for the first time.  For reference the stuttering Siri is on a HomePod MQHV2LL/A with OS version 14.3.  I‚Äôm posting here to share my odd experience. Has anyone heard their Siri stutter before??"
Hi everyone. What is the voice command for Siri to set my waking alarm in bedtime for tomorrow? Everything I tried was only setting the regular alarm.  Thank in advance

"Hi guys, i just bought a xiaomi bedside lamp 2 and very happy because Siri can control most of it funtion( color, brightness,..) but i‚Äôm wonder can siri change the color to flow mode?"

"Under the Siri Shortcuts in the Target app it says that Siri managing my lists is enabled, but I can‚Äôt figure out build lists and have Siri add/complete them."
"Hi, I am having trouble setting up Siri.   When I do the Hey Siri setup wizard and say ‚Äòhey, Siri‚Äô de speech bubble moves as if speech is detected but it says it does not understand me. Does anyone recognize this? Is there a way to reset?   It‚Äôs an iPhone XR with iOS 14.2"
"Hi there,  Is anyone of you aware of how to do the following with Siri?  * Ask the title of the active tab in Safari * Ask the name of the active application * Have Siri say ‚Äòdone‚Äô when it completes a command successfully  When I am not looking at the screen for some reason, I would know those things.  Thanks."
"Is there any way to adjust the way that Siri pronounces playlist names? I have a playlist called ‚ÄòGenerica‚Äô and when I ask Siri to play it, she know which one I mean but she always replied ‚ÄòPlaying ‚ÄòJen-reeka‚Äô. It‚Äôs definitely not a serious issue but this sort of stuff does grind my gears. Is there any way to adjust her pronounciation?"
"In the podcasts app I have 3 personal stations set up. ""Daily Podcasts"", ""Unlistened Podcasts"" and ""Sport Podcasts"". when I ask siri to play Daily Podcasts or Station Daily Podcasts, it loads some podcast called ""Daily"" or something it calls ""the daily podcasts"" both of which have absolutely nothing to do with any of my podcast subscriptions, or it insists on playing a match from music.   Is there a way I can use Siri to call up the stations I set up in the podcast app, or do I forever have to do that manually?   It's OK when I can interact with my iPhone or iPad, but I want to be able to play these from a homepod with my phone/tablet in another room, or in my car while driving."
"I have only one shortcut set up on my phone. It's an extremely simple shortcut. All it does is launch Pocket Casts and tells it to resume playback. That's it.  Prior to the latest version of iOS, it worked every single time and I was quite happy, because I was tired of iOS always shutting down every app after like 5 minutes, and when I hit play it would start something I was listening to on Apple Music three weeks ago.  ANYways... now, almost every single time I tell Siri my ""play podcast"" shortcut, it comes back and asks me to confirm it. It does this on the phone and watch. It's really annoying and really makes it NOT a shortcut anymore.  Is there a way to stop this?"
"I'm having a weird problem that seems to be new in the latest version of iOS.  Here's a scenario I find myself in often. I want to set an alarm for later that day to remind me to do something (because I don't find actual reminders to be alerting enough). So lets say it's 10am. I say ""Siri, set an alarm for 2 to call Sam."" Siri would then set my alarm for 2PM that day. Cool.  But now, the exact same scenario will set an alarm for 2am.  Why? I recognize that I can say ""2pm,"" but sometimes I forget. It seems to me that if they're trying to add more artificial intelligence into Siri, making it assume that I want an alarm to go off at 2am isn't very intelligent.  So what's the deal? Is this new?"
Tuesday morning I asked Siri to set a 10:30pm alarm for Thursday. She claimed she can‚Äôt make an alarm for more than a day ahead.   But..... Asking Siri to set an alarm for 10:30pm every Thursday works?  What the heck? Guess I‚Äôll just have to remember to go in and turn it off or delete it after the alarm goes off.
"I am having an issue with the announce messages feature. I have an iPhone SE 2020 running 14.2, an Apple Watch running watchOS 7, and gen 2 AirPods. I have the feature enabled on my phone and watch, and half the time it works properly with my AirPods and the other half it just doesn‚Äôt announce them. Sometimes if I ask Siri if I have new messages she says no which I clearly do, but it has marked them as ‚Äúread‚Äù for some reason, it‚Äôs become to frustrate me. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the correct subreddit for this kind of problem, if not could someone direct me in the right direction. Is this issue problematic for anyone else? Is there an easily solution to resolve this? Thank you for your time."
"It just seems to me that functions such as setting timers and other missed features would be pretty easy to implement? Is there a certain limitation or complication that prevents apple from doing this? Or is it like adding a calculator app on the iPad, where they're waiting so they can do it juusstttt right?"

I asked Siri to name a song and she replied with the artist and song information but I accidentally dismissed he response. Then the song ended I couldn‚Äôt ask Siri again.   Can I review her information and get the song/artist information?
"I was talking with a friend and my phone was on the table. During the talk i said: ‚Äûha! Thats funny.‚Äú or something like that, when Siri got activated and asked if it is because she said something?  I thought such assisatants just wait for the activation phase and nothing else. I was pretty surprised and if im honest i dont like that, is this normal?  Thanks"
"Hey,  I‚Äôve been having this issue lately and can‚Äôt figure out how to solve it.   Since the ios14 update, when I ask Siri on my AirPods to switch songs, pause, tell me the time, weather, etc etc it will stay open on my lock screen. Then it starts to drain my battery. So after a few minutes if I pick up my phone Siri will be open on Lock Screen with whatever I had requested still open. Any suggestions?"
"So I'm trying to get Siri to pronounce a contact's name right when reading off texts.  Siri: ""From ""contact name"" \*reads message\*""  While teaching it, it took a couple tries to get the right option, but eventually got it and it told me it learned how to pronounce the name. It still can't get it right though when reading messages to me (uses original, wrong, pronunciation). I added the phonetic spelling in the contacts too but nothing.   Any suggestions?   Thanks"
"Ive been dealing with this for a long time and cant fix it. Voice memos hears me perfectly, but siri can't. When I try to set up the ""hey siri"" function, and it asks me to say ""hey siri"" a few times to learn my voice, it just doesn't hear me. Also, when I hold down the power button to activate siri, it can hear me like 1/20 times. Its extremely frustrating. Any ideas?"
"My Siri doesn‚Äôt understand the command ‚Äûtell Anna ... This and that‚Äú. Instead of composing a message to the contact ‚ÄûAnna‚Äú, it says ‚Äûthe group Anna doesn‚Äôt support messages‚Äú.

"I always use Siri to set my alarms by saying ‚Äúset an alarm for 2‚Äù or any other time. I just upgraded from an iPhone 7+ to iPhone 12 pro. When I use Siri on my new phone, she always sets the alarm at 2 a.m. instead of 2 p.m.  On my iPhone 7+, she would always default to 2pm. I know I can say ‚ÄúSet an alarm for 2pm‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äúpm‚Äù every day. Is there a way to change Siri to set my alarms at the correct time?"
"For example ask her to read the phrases ‚Äúhis intimacy‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to fulfill‚Äù. Even though Siri certainly know how to pronounce words ‚Äúintimacy‚Äù and ‚Äúfulfill‚Äù correctly on their own, it consistently mispronounces them in context. And this is not just about these two words ‚Äî if you use the iOS text-to-speech functions regularly, you know that these errors happen all the time (maybe once a minute).  How is this even possible?  Another annoyance is that it can never decide whether to pronounce years as 19-99 or ‚Äúone thousand nine hundred...‚Äù"
"This has been going on for about a month and it's making me crazy.  It's not every time, but often enough to be really annoying.

It's happening with HomePod, apple watches, and iPhones.  It's also happening to everyone in the house.  Lights are often unreachable or not responding in the home app.  Sometimes, it will work the first time but Siri will apologize that she couldn't reach the device."

i got an iPhone 7 in Jan 2020 and the battery capacity now is 85%. I want to replace and went to an authorised repairer and he said that the battery should have 800 cycles for it to be replaced.

"I use Siri in French and this problem doesn't seem to happen in English. But my main (only...) use of Siri is to set alarms. I always used to say (in French) ""*Alarm at 10:30*"" and the alarm was set.  Now whenever I say this, Siri answers ""*There is no alarm at 10:30*"" or, if I had set an old alarm at this time, it just gives me a status on it ""*This alarm is currently deactivated*"".  To set an alarm I now have to say ""*Set alarm at 10:30*"" which doesn't seem like a big deal but is getting extremely bugging on a daily basis, as I use a lot of alarms every day for my work.  Anyone else noticed this?"

"Hello all,  I just wanted to know if Apple have stopped investing in Siri? I'm in the process of transitioning my home to a ""smart home"". I had hoped to use Siri and  Homekit as the central hub for this as I am otherwise plugged into the Apple ecosystem anyway.  However, unless I'm doing something wrong, it really can't compete with Google Home or Alexa. I refer specifically to Siri and NLP capabilities. It mostly isn't able to action more than basic commands such as telling me what the weather is or converting measurements, etc. Followup questions don't seem to work, i.e. you have to say Hey Siri again. For a lot of basic and more complex tasks, it simply asks you to unlock your iphone or it points you to a website which isn't helpful for a handsfree experience. It doesn't seem to be able to control my Sonos system, there's no comparable product to the Google Next hubs or the Echos.  Given how far advanced the others are, and how much time Apple have had to improve, I'm reluctant to invest in an Apple setup if they've simply stopped supporting / investing in it.  Any ideas?  Deepesh  &amp;#x200B;  PS On a positive side, the Home app is pretty good actually. It's more robust than the others."
"So I found something very interesting today. I was checking how much a subscription would cost me per year if I choose the monthly option, and I asked Siri how much that would be. To my absolute surprise, apparently Siri (or Wolfram Alpha) does not understand what euros are, or well non-dollar currencies actually. Every time you ask for a calculation with some currency, it opts for ""Okay, here's what I found on the web"". But if you decide to make it dollars, then all of a sudden the Wolfram Alpha plugin (software? idk) comes up and gives you a calculation. Has anyone else had this issue? Tbh its kinda astounding to me that Siri can't handle other currencies apparently. Has anyone found a way (barring ofc just to say numbers without currencies, i just said the currency without really thinking about it the first time around) to counteract this?"

"Hello  I asked Siri the definition of Nile so I can get the length of th eNile River, but it keeps giving me the etymology of the Catalan name Niall, which isn't even pronounced like Nile is.  I know this because my next door neighbour is form catalonia and the all in Niall is pronounced like the word all.  I don't have Niall in my contacts under the name Niall as I call him by a nickname that sounds nothing like Niall.  So why does Siri keep switching ""Nile"" to ""Niall"" when I say ""definition of Nile?""  I know that there's a famous singer name dNiall (odd that an Irish guy has a Catalan first name but anyway) again, Nile and Niall are not pronounced the same way.  How do I get Siri to not hear ""definition of Nile"" as ""Definition of Niall?""  I don't want Niall, I know it's a Catalan name, I want it to talk about the Nile River.  I use Siri when my hands are wet or busy doing things like cooking, so I can't just waltz over to my phone and use my hands to type.  I also do not have a U.S. or standard UK accent as i am Singaporean, though I do live in the UK.  I'm careful to say ""nile"" not ""Niall"" but I guess Siri has a thing for Catalan men?"

Sometimes sporadically throughout the day my Hey Siri won‚Äôt activate and it seems to be at the times when I really need to use it. Like when washing dishes or doing other things when my hands are unavailable to manually activate. I seem to only have this issue on my iPhone 11 Pro Max and it happens with and without my AirPods Pro being connected. Not sure if this is a common issue but I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing this and/or knew of a way to fix this. I‚Äôve tried restarting my phone and redoing the Hey Siri setup prompts.

"Hello,  Is there any way to use Siri to read the website content without activating the accessibility feature? Currently I am getting only ""there is nothing to read"" if I ask Siri to read me the website. What can be the reason? The answer is somewhat unclear."
What are your thoughts on the answer?
"I don't need Siri to tell me ""OK, DAN, THE LIGHT ARE OFF"" when I am standing under them. I know if I use Siri without ""Hey Siri,"" such as on my iPhone, there is no verbal confirmation  (I have found this option in the settings), but when will saying ""Hey Siri"" not invoke a confirming response? Ideally Siri would know where I am in the home and confirm if the command is in another location, but that's a pipe dream.  I bring it up because the other day after I updated to 14.2 I had asked for lights to turn off and Siri did it without telling me anything, and I immediately noticed and thought it was a new feature. But here I am today and I told her ""turn on the downstairs lights"" and she said literally: ""ok the light are on."" I don't have the British Siri so I was shocked to hear her use this grammar.   I wish we just had the option to not have Siri yell back at me when I tell her to do something. The completed action is suffice."
"Every time I ask Siri to play something from my library, she gives me that message, even though I don‚Äôt use Apple Music.   Is this a bug? Can I turn it off? It‚Äôs annoying, and I‚Äôm even saying ‚Äúfrom my library‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt work at all."

Also if I'm mainly connected to my phone, I won't hear the AW Siri replies in my airpods,which could've been handy...  Another thing that keeps bothering me is when I use the AW to control the volume from my phone to my airpods, it takes a while of scrolling with the crown for it to actually connect and change volume."

"Recently, that is since updating to iOS 14 on my iPhone 11 Pro, Siri has been behaving inconsistently and unreliably, and I'm wondering if this has been an experience among others.  I basically only do two things on Siri: start timers, and control HomeKit items. For context on the HomeKit items, they never show any latency in responding to control actions when I control them in the Home app, so HomeKit is not imparting any latency. When Siri works properly, both of these types of requests seem to resolve almost immediately.  These are the two types of issues I've frequently encountered:  * **Going AWOL**: When I invoke Siri on my iPhone by holding the Side Button, and say ""set a timer for five minutes,"" the Siri icon will simply disappear from the screen, without response, and a timer will not be set. This is particularly troublesome because I have no indication it failed until I find no timer was set. * **Hanging, absent connection issues**: When I invoke Siri in the same way and either set a timer or say, e.g., ""turn on the chandelier,"" Siri will hang for a while, displaying generic waiting messages like ""Hold on..."" or ""On it..."" or ""Just a second..."" and then, after a long wait, fail with a generic error message.  I have witnessed this for at least the past couple weeks, while at home, standing directly under a high power AP in my kitchen, with what I believe to be a high-speed, low-latency, stable connection to the internet. I know there were purported issues with Ubiquiti APs very recently patched, but I've seen the issue after that patch, so I see no correlation.  For one, has anyone else had these Siri inconsistency issues, and second, is there any fix or mitigation to these issues? For some odd reason, starting and then stopping Airplane Mode seems to reliably fix the random latency issue, but that's not a long-term solution."
My in law has Home Pod and Siri just keeps playing songs all by itself.
"So, I used to own an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S series) and when I'd tell it to take a picture, it'd just snap the camera right then and there.  My partner and I are in a long distance relationship, so I'd often send them pictures of myself this way. I even got a tripod specifically designed for smartphones.  A while back, I changed from Samsung to Apple so I could access iTunes on my phone and listen to my music while I was out driving. However, if I say ""Hey Siri, take a picture."" it just opens the camera app and does nothing else.  Is there any way to actually make Siri... well... actually *take a picture*?"
I just bought a HomePod for the master bedroom and when I was in the kitchen I tried talking to Siri on my iPhone but she responded on the HomePod. Is there anyway to set it so Siri knows when you‚Äôre not in that room?
"When I‚Äôm unable to reach for my phone, say I‚Äôm driving or in the shower..  I shout ‚Äòhey Siri call Luke‚Äô  Siri then calls Luke using the handset.... I then have to take my hands off the steering wheel and press the speaker button on the screen.    But the whole idea of using hey Siri was because I don‚Äôt want to pick my phone up...  Could you please make it so when I ask Siri to call someone Siri then asks me wether or not I want to put the call on speaker.   I‚Äôm not sure if this is a bug but when I do say ‚Äòhey Siri call Luke on speaker‚Äô the call still comes through the handset and then I have to grab the phone to put it on speaker :/"
Siri automatically stops working when I connect it to my 17 Ford Fusion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt help while you are driving.‚Äù  HELP!
Hi everyone.  I was trying to run my short cut by using Siri. it only runs shortcut apps and what I want to do is to run specific script in the shortcut app by using  Siri.  does anyone have answer for that ? I have already checked the internet resources but I couldn't find any of the answer.....  help me !!
"Usual as in weather, initiating calls, texts and timers. E.g. I like to use Siri to ‚Äûdigitalise‚Äú any long number strings (like parcel tracking no) and also like adding items to my grocery and drugstore lists. What are your often used commands?"
"Today is Saturday.  I asked Siri to ""Remind me every weekday at 10am to go to the mailbox"" so that I get a daily nag to go to my mailbox, which I will delete once I've done it.  She dutifully created a custom weekly reminder set to remind on Monday-Friday.  Except that the first occurrence of the reminder is set to happen tomorrow, Sunday, at 10am.  ??????"
"I don't know if this is across all devices as I own an android phone, and have an iPad.   Siri keeps responding to me trying to talk to Google Assistant. Seems kind of funny, but is there any way to turn it off?"
"Do somebody know if this feature works with third-party apps like WhatsApp or Telegram? If so, how can I turn it on?"
What is the reasoning behind preventing this?  Surely it‚Äôs easy enough to enable.
"Me and my gf tried it on our macs and phones, Siri will process the word ""clam"" as ""klamm"" every single time. Kinda weird, not like clam is an uncommon word."
"When I use Siri to call someone, it mentions the device my contact is associated with.   For example, I go ""Siri, call X"" and it goes""Calling X. Mobile"" can I stop her saying Mobile everytime?"
"With ''hey siri function''     with the new Home mini Arriving next month. Is it possible to send every text spoken to siri with the homepod ip/name/or wtv , as a string and a variable respectively ( i am think about using shorcut with ssh wich is pretty easy to send an ip as a variable ...but not sure aboout the text spoken using siri.         that would allow room awareness .      I am already doing it with iobroker with echo dots. Would be nice to change to homepods"
"They actually managed to make Siri even worse.  There are many times i ask stuff now and nothing happens now. No ‚Äúsorry i didnt catch that‚Äù,  - nothing.   They removed the live speech to text, so i dont know if it understood any part of what i said.   The animation doesnt react according to my voice like before  I long press the button on the side, and the siri icon appears - in the bottom. if it appeared next to the button i just pushed would be more intuitive."
"Apple claims I should be able to tell siri on my phone ""watch \[show\] on appleTV"" and have the TV start playing, but I can't figure this out.  Anybody use this successfully?  [https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT209464](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT209464)  &amp;#x200B;  I recently got an AppleTV 4k after using a FireTV for years.  One if the features I used the most on the FireTV was being able to tell my Echo ""watch \[show\]"" and it would power on my AV system and start playing.  If Siri had this capability, I would probably switch to a homepod, but I can't figure it out.  All that happens when I ask Siri to play a show on ""Living room TV,"" is the TV app opens on the device I am using.  Sometimes I also get ""I can't do that here"" (great error message, team!)  I noticed that the docs say ""connected to wifi,"" does that literally mean wifi or just connected to the same network?  I have ethernet run to my AV stack, I'm not going to downgrade to wifi.  Does this feature just use airplay?  I despise airplay for this use case b/c it consumes battery/resources on my phone, interrupts the stream if I try to watch a short vid on phone, and not every app(youtube) cooperates with the screen locking.  It's also ridiculous to have my iPhoneSE do trasncoding to the more powerful AppleTV."
"Whenever I ask siri to play anything from spotify (I tried both ""play 21 pilots on spotify"" and ""play good songs (a playlist of mine) on spotify"") it just returns saying ""I couldn't find \[insert name\] on spotify"". How do I fix this?"
"I found an old iPhone 4S in a thrift store, but when I turned Siri on It doesn't have a voice. I tried everything to get Siri to have a voice, but I couldn't. Any suggestions?"
"In my country, Apple News is blocked. Now when trying out the new ""What's my update?"" with Siri, it starts to talk about the weather and my next appointment and then it says ""Oh, you need an app for that."" ... but it doesn't say which app or gives a list of compatible apps or anything.  Are there any compatible apps yet?"
"Recently my Siri has been acting slow. I usually use Siri to quickly check on scores and schedules of sports teams I follow. Last week Siri was able to tell me the score of the Dallas Cowboys game against the Cleveland Browns normally, then I asked for the Dodgers schedule and again it worked. That was about four days ago. Now recently I asked for updates on the NBA finals and Siri was slow and didn‚Äôt even say the score it just pulled up Wolfram Alpha data.  I asked for the schedule for the Dodgers again and Siri couldn‚Äôt bring up the same results as before just a wiki article on the team or ESPN articles. I asked for the Dallas Cowboys score for today and Siri took long just to tell me an error occurred. What‚Äôs strange is Siri can still do normal things like check the weather or make calls but with these questions it won‚Äôt work. I did everything I thought I can do to fix it. Reset my wifi connection, rebooted my phone, turned Siri on and off and even deleted the Siri dictation history. Still no luck. The only thing I haven‚Äôt tried is updating from iOS 14 to 14.0.1 because I heard that it‚Äôs super buggy with the widgets. Anybody else deal with this or something similar? TL;DR Siri results don‚Äôt show up like they used to a week ago how do I fix this?"
"Whenever I use Siri on my Mac or HomePod, its a lil bothersome I need to remember to say to shuffle the playlist, otherwise its the same songs in order. Is there any work around to allow me to say ‚ÄúHey Siri, Play [Playlist]‚Äù and she will shuffle automatically?"
I usually use Siri to ask about game scores and times. Today she won‚Äôt return anything more than web search results.   Are sports request still working for anyone else?
"I wanted to make a shortcut that when you double tap on the back that would lock the screen, but I noticed that if you ask Siri to lock the screen she replies that she can‚Äôt  do it. Why so? Is there a way to make this shortcut?"
"Do you want to have an universal remote control that can control all of your appliances from one place a remote that can be integrated with Amazon Echo Device, Google Home, Siri, Node-RED and Home Assistant?

"Announce messages with Siri completely disappeared from my phone. I think it happened when I updated to 14.1  It worked perfectly before, and I had a shortcut in my control center too, but now it has disappeared.  What‚Äôs going on? Did they remove it or what?  For information I have an iPhone 11 and AirPods Pro, so the devices shouldn‚Äôt be an issue."

"I asked Siri to scare me, and she did. I need to find put if anyone else has experienced this.  I was in bed with my girlfriend last night and like iPhones some times do, her phone must have heard ‚ÄòHey Siri‚Äô from somewhere in our conversation, prompting the Siri jingle to play aloud. This unwarranted response majorly creeped my girlfriend out to my amusement, so I decided to ask Siri to scare me. Her response was something like this:  ‚ÄúWait for it...          wait for it.........           ‚Äú Then she said something that I couldn‚Äôt really understand? (I recently switched to the Indian accent to change things up which might be why) phonetically it sounded like CAH-JU-DATING. Obviously this was just another lacklustre siri joke that barely warranted a chuckle from me. Our conversation then dwindled on for a good while before, seemingly out of the blue, Siri spoke that same word again; ‚ÄúCAH-JU-DATING‚Äù. causing my girlfriend to scream and honestly it caught me off-guard too. I was made to turn off my phone last night and while trying to recreate what happened last night I can‚Äôt? I ask Siri to scare me and the only response I get is ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù Any one else experienced this?"
I want to record my request to Siri and the response in audio and screen. If I use screen recorder with Siri I get the answer recorded (audio adn screen) but not my audio request. If I just just use screen recorder and speak I can play back my audio and the screen.   I cannot find a way to record both my audio request and Siri's response with the screen as well.  Suggestions welcome...

"I noticed Siri is incredibly slow to both receive and respond to my commands since the new update. I now have to wait several seconds before I see any actions, and usually it‚Äôs just easier to do the function by going to whatever app I want to use. Is this a common issue? And if so, are there any fixes?"
I‚Äôm curious: does anyone actually use the Siri suggestions feature?
Now that in iOS14 you can have a type-in Siri wouldn‚Äôt it be useful to have Apple integrating this feature on the Search Widget?

When I try to setup the hey Siri, I can‚Äôt go past the first step, because it does not detect any voice.   I have no problems with audio and other apps. When I call someone they have no issues listen to me.   It only happens with Siri.   Any ideas what might be causing this?"
"I don‚Äôt know if it is just because of iOS 14 now or it was before too but it now helps me with my pre calculus homework too. I just say Hey Siri 7x^2 + 9x - 3 and it actually graphs the question and shows it without taking me to safari and blah blah. So far I haven‚Äôt even used my calculator, I just throw the questions at her and it works 100% of the time."

I know that would be hard, specially when the language in text messages are a bit ""broken"", but at least it would be nice to be able to say ""read the last message in Portuguese"", which is not a bad alternative or not that hard to do... specially on the new iOS 14 that already has a translate app that can detect languages..."

"This could work in one of two ways, and maybe even a little of both.   1.	Voice recognition. Siri would be able to recognize your personal voice like Face ID or Touch ID and give you information without needing to unlock your phone.  2.	Using a code word to unlock your phone or vocalize the 4-6+ digit numerical passcode to unlock your device when prompted by Siri.   What do you think? How should a feature like that be implemented in order to ensure privacy and security while using Siri, but also making Siri more confident to use hands free?"

I‚Äôm not sure if anyone here can help or not but worth a shot since I asked on r/Spotify as well but it seems as if that‚Äôs a sub mainly for playlists.  I set my iPhone up to be able to use ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù and have her play specific songs on Spotify for me. But once I‚Äôm done listening to a specific song and want to go back to my liked songs (for anyone unfamiliar with Spotify it‚Äôs basically just one big main playlist of songs  that you‚Äôve clicked a heart icon on while listening to it). But when I tell Siri to play my liked songs on Spotify she always plays some playlist that‚Äôs called ‚Äúliked from radio‚Äù which apparently I have and there‚Äôs only one song on it. I‚Äôve tried deleting the ‚Äúliked from radio‚Äù playlist but it doesn‚Äôt work.  Any suggestions?

"A good example of this is Fantastic! You'd think it'd just say fantastic right? No, it says Fantastic! Like it's happy.

If for example you put three in a row like ""no no no"" it will speak it as no no no like it's getting scared.  It's interesting hearing the little bits of emotion they've thrown in here and there and AFAICT this is only a feature of the main siri voices, the normal voices don't do this."

"I think the key reasons why voice will win out are accessibility, versatility, and user empowerment.   **Accessibility**: Voice levels the tech-playing field, especially for older generations that aren‚Äôt well equipped to run their lives on tiny screens and complicated app interfaces.  **Versatility**: As we continue building use cases around voice platforms, we enable a single point of interaction that can handle hundreds of problems for us.  **Empowering:** Voice assistants enable the Bruce Almighty experience - feeling back in control of technology instead of the other way around.

"I‚Äôm laying in bed watching YouTube past midnight when I remembered I need to schedule my dentist appointment. I summoned Siri on my watch and said ‚ÄúRemind me to schedule my dentist appointment tomorrow afternoon‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt thinking when I said this, and tomorrow is technically Wednesday the 19th. Even so, Siri then asked, ‚ÄúJust to be clear, do you mean Tuesday August 18th or Wednesday August 19th?‚Äù I thought this was a really smart feature."
"How can I find my name that my home pod uses? I'm trying to run a shortcut that plays a playlist, but after I say the trigger for the shortcut, home pod asks who I am. When I say my first or first and last name, it keeps telling me I have to go to settings and share my location, which is already done. So how do I see what or how to say my home pod name? Or what is a fix to this issue?"
"Title  For the entire week siri is nonstop complaining about not being to connect, to the internet to do stuff. I have full bars. I have tried just about everything on google and are beyond annoyed and irritated at this problem. Any suggestion what to do to fix it?  I'll ask it to open a app. I'll get Siri saying just a moment then fail to do anything  I have to reboot turn off and then on Wifi. And that sometimes works. What the hell is going on here? How do I fix it?"
Is there a way to specify which device you want Siri to respond on? Mostly want to know so I can ask Siri the battery level on a device that‚Äôs charging at the corner of the room. Thanks!
Siri just reacted to media COMING FROM THE SAME IPAD. Like for real Apple??? Thanks for interrupting my tv show because the iPad isn‚Äôt smart enough to realise media audio of ‚ÄúI see‚Äù is not me asking for Siri....
Hey y'all I have had my Siri set on autrailian for the longest time. I switched it back to the default American version and it seems like Siri has more responses and a different itonization of her voice. Does the Australian version and other versions like British have less features and scripts? Or so all the accent types have the same exact things they say?  &amp;#x200B;  \-Thanks!
"I‚Äôm having an issue with Siri killing my battery. Siri has been eating over 50% of my battery lately. I haven‚Äôt used Siri and I have ‚ÄòHey Siri‚Äô turned off.   I read this was a known issue but was fixed with update 13.4. My Xr is updated to 13.6. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue what, if any, their fix was. Thanks!"
Is it possible to have Siri speak in english but when I want to compose say a message through Siri I will speak a different compatible language?
Hi  Siri is unable to turn my Dyson fan on when locked. Meaning I have to manual unlock the phone first and then it works  This kind of defeats the object of using voice to control things.   Does anyone know if it‚Äôs my settings or is it a bug or even just rubbish intended behaviour?  Thanks in advance
"I‚Äôve noticed this happens a lot when dictating to DayOne, but I‚Äôve noticed elsewhere too. Happen to anyone else?"
How or where do I create a Siri command to ask to clear all notifications when iPhone is locked?  I‚Äôm lazy and don‚Äôt want to manually clear notifications rather I‚Äôd just say ‚ÄúHey Siri clear all my notifications‚Äù when phone is on lock.  Google is not my bff today.
Found that a bit creepy/a subtle dig cause Google is always listening to us
"So the problem I have is this.. i connect my Bluetooth headphones, start spotify, play music, adjust the volume to where want it (loud, usually) and begin my exercise. If I say ""hey siri, play the next song"" siri responds but when the music comes back on it's at low volume.   I've searched this sub and also did my requisite google searches for this problem but only found issues related to siri's volume itself. I tried changing siri's volume as well but it still does this. Even if siri's volume is set loud, it defaults me back to low on the music. Very annoying.  Any ideas?"
"Hello all, I just wanted to ask early iOS14 adopters if Shazam Integration has improved using Siri.  One big flaw I find extremely annoying in IOS13 is that if I use Siri to ID a song playing (‚Äúhey Siri, what‚Äôs playing?/what‚Äôs this song?‚Äù et al) it will Shazam it in the bg while responding something like ‚Äúlet me have a listen‚Äù and will eventually find it and display it as a Siri response, BUT it will not be saved in the shazams list, which means that if I don‚Äôt interact with the result and, say, the screen turns off, the ID is gone (forever...)  Can somebody tell me if this is somehow ‚Äúfixed‚Äù in iOS14?  Thanks in advance üòä"
"I asked Siri ‚Äúif it was 7 o‚Äôclock what time would it be if 8 hours had passed‚Äù and it just kept tell me the current time.   Am I just wording it weird because I‚Äôve tried at least 10 different ways of asking including saying I don‚Äôt want the current time and it‚Äôs always the same thing   The amount of time I‚Äôve spent on this I would have been better off just not being lazy and doing the math myself but I‚Äôm over that now, I wanna know why Siri can‚Äôt add hours"
"Siri likes pulling up web pages for simple things like math equations and stuff that I‚Äôve seen Siri just say rather than giving me web options   HOW DO I STOP SIRI FROM SHOWING ME WEB RESULTS  I never use Siri to look something up the only time I need it is to check something in an Apple app like weather or again the calculator.   Is there a way to completely stop Siri from using safari or chrome and having it only give me straight forward answers. I do not mind hearing. ‚ÄúSorry I don‚Äôt know that one‚Äù because at least the ai is admitting it can‚Äôt do something rather than giving me something completely unrelated   Also on a side note why can‚Äôt Siri calculate time, I asked for what time It‚Äôd be 8 hours past 7 and it just told me the current time"

"Just got a max recently and you can have it announce the time on the hour, it can do it in all of Siri‚Äôs stock voices and some extra one like Scottish English. Is there anyway to enable these voices for Siri as I can‚Äôt seem to find a way."
"Trying to use Hey Siri with maps. I‚Äôve got my favourites set up in maps. But when I use Hey Siri, the feedback shows it has understood what I‚Äôve said and everything is spelt properly but it won‚Äôt navigate to a favourite. It goes off and finds something irrelevant. Is this what happens to other people or is it just me? Is there anything I can do to improve it?"
"I have multiple languages (for keyboards) but English is the first choice. However, when I click on a Siri suggested wiki page, it defaults to the second language.  Yet I know the content exists in English - and even the summary in the results is in English.   I should not have to remove the keyboard to fix this. Any ideas?"
"Every time I would ask siri to add something to a list, she would say ""Ok, added"" but she would say it with a cadence as if my name was ""added."" Imagine saying ""ok, John"" vs ""ok, added"" - in the second instance you would have a significant pause after the word ""ok"" and this bug has been driving me nuts for months and they finally fixed it!  I filed an official bug with apple months ago and I have been waiting for this day. HALLELUJAH."
"I have a question and if this is the wrong subreddit to ask this please point me in the right direction. Why does Siri suggested websites give me irrelevant results to what I‚Äôm searching. I tried to look up the song Superman by Goldfinger from the tony hawk game for the ps2  this morning but I had forgotten the name of the band, so I wanted to type ‚ÄúSuperman skate song‚Äù into spotlight. I got as far as ‚ÄúSuperman skate s‚Äù before a bunch of weird suggested websites popped up. Some had to do with orthopedics and spirituality and something with the word wheely and a really weird one that had to do with male ability. I haven‚Äôt looked up anything on safari or any of my apps for Siri to suggest this. How do I get rid of it and stop it from showing up? Looking up ‚ÄúSuperman skate‚Äù brings up  normal results like YouTube videos on skate tricks or skate shops but however typing that extra s brings up those weird results. Any help would be appreciated. TL;DR  My spotlight searches bring up weird irrelevant results to what I typed. How do stop it from doing that?"
Scenario: my colleague and I seem to have the same voice frequency so that when I would try to activate my Siri it also triggers his.  Then what happens next is weird: one of the two Siri stops immediately to let the other answer even without one of the two Siri making any audible feedback to its activation... Sometimes his Siri would stop to let mine speaking and sometimes the opposite ü§î   So my question is how does Siri could know that another Siri has been triggered at the same time while not hearing it ? Does it mean iPhone devices communicate  ?
I just realised that the British Siri voice sounds like Paddington from the films and now I can‚Äôt stop hearing it.
"This has never happened before but Siri read out my text messages via my AirPods, I immediately googled it but it seems it‚Äôs not technically supported on 1st gen AirPods.   Hasn‚Äôt happened since, very strange. I was also able to reply via my AirPods."
"Pre-iOS 13, Siri would create reminders lighting fast. The instant I was done speaking, the reminder would be ready to go. However, ever since Apple redesigned the Reminders app in iOS 13, Siri takes about 3-6 seconds to create a reminder. Not a huge deal, I know, but it is noticeably slower compared to other Siri tasks. And it‚Äôs particularly annoying when I‚Äôm listing to a podcast or music and I have to wait for Siri to finish.   Two questions: Does anyone notice the slowdown in iOS 13, or is it just me? And did iOS 14 improve the speed?"
"OK I would like Siri to just record items on a list.  I want to put stuff on a list without a reminder (Reminders) or a to do list(Any.do) or having to add invites (Bring!) I just want to create a list as if I had a pencil and paper...But I want to be able to dictate &amp; I want to be able to do it hands free.  I remember things all day long but then when I need to know, I can‚Äôt remember them.   Is there any way to accomplish this goal?"
I just bought a new iPhone 11 and I signed up to what'sapp and on my friends phone who did not have my new number Siri wrote under my old one the new number of mine how can I turn it off.
"I keep my inbox clean. Right now there are two messages in it, total. But for some reason, whenever I ask Siri to read me my e-mail, it always says I have over 25 messages and lists ALL of my most recent e-mail.  Seems pretty basic Siri. Come on."
Getting really tired of every request I make ‚Äî typically through a HomePod ‚Äî to have a wait time of 30 seconds or so. Preceded by ‚Äòjust a second‚Äô ... ‚Äòworking on that‚Äô ... ‚Äòone more moment‚Äô or one of the many other variations! It‚Äôs so frustrating. You really need time to plan a simple album? üôÑüò≥  Is anybody else experiencing this? Will a router reset or something help speed things up? It‚Äôs become so noticeable lately.
Currently web answers only work in a couple English speaking countries. Even when using US English for Siri and US English as phone language I don‚Äôt get web answers. Has anyone found a way to get these outside the US?
"I often schedule reminders with Siri. However, if I get the notification for the reminder, and cannot complete the task right now, can I re-schedule the reminder using Siri?  Thanks."
"I have spent the last 3 weeks having to ask Siri TWICE for almost every command. Example ""Hey Siri, put this song in my rap playlist"", hmm I cant find a playlist with that name? ""Hey Siri, put this song in my rap playlist"", Sure, Ive added xxx to your rap playlist.    I live between two houses, so Ive tried Siri on two different wifi networks, but still the same problem.    I think even Siri can hear the change of my tone when I have to repeat commands, grr!  Oh and to add, I have every device updated, but I still have no Handsoff (iPhone 6S+) and even with bluetooth off and the iPhone facedown, they both battle out for who's gonna play the music I asked for (usually iPhone wins, NOT what I intended).    First world problems..."

"Hey All,   I‚Äôve been having an issue with Siri lately. When I have my AirPods in, I get a notification sound that I received a text, but Siri will not read it out loud to me anymore.

"It seems recently that when I ask something to Siri that it will say ""I found something on web about &lt;whatever I asked&gt;, check it out"" but the screen is blank (with just the siri light blob thing at the bottom)."
"Hey!  I bought an iphone SE (original version) a few months ago, and until recently it was working just fine, but a few weeks ago I noticed that it‚Äôs not picking up my voice very well. After some looking around I found out that Siri started to use the backpanel microphone (camera microphone) to listen to my voice.  I don‚Äôt know why this happened  because my normal microphone is working perfectly.   I was hoping that some one could help me with this problem.  Thanks in advance!  Greg"
Currently I‚Äôm only able to do School and Work locations.
X was my girlfriend 3 months ago. Today i asked siri to call my girlfriend and she called X. how can i change my girlfriend on siri.
"Hi  Would someone know how to go about creating a shortcut for UNLOVE song in apple music (unpressing love/back to neutral)?  Siri is not responding to UNLOVE, it only understands LOVE (suggest more like this) and DISLIKE (suggest less like this).   I‚Äôve set up smart playlists that add loved songs from a specific genre to a playlist, and removing love status removes them from that playlist.   I need a quick way to UNLOVE because I‚Äôm using music in the car with bluetooth.   If anyone has any suggestions on how to do this with either SIRI or SHORTCUTS, I would be very grateful.   Thank you all"
"I set Siri to speak English but my music library contains titles in different languages (Russian, Italian, French,...) so if I say ‚ÄúSiri play *english title*‚Äù it obviously plays it no problem but if I say ‚ÄúSiri play *italian title*‚Äù she doesn‚Äôt understand; is there a way around it?"
"Hi, after a search I saw this talked about in ways a few years ago and I'm curious if there are any updates.  Is it possible to trigger a Homekit scene with an alarm or a timer?  * Time scheduled scenes work, but as someone that sleeps inconsistent hours,  it would be great to be able to trigger a HomeKit scene just by my setting an alarm.  Has any discovered any alternative useful phrases for Siri + Homekit?  * EG. I used to say ""Hey Siri set the scene to Night"" but after a few years realized I could just say ""Hey Siri Goodnight"" to trigger the same scene. Has anyone discovered any other useful ""simple"" phrases?   Thanks!"
"I'm a fan of the idea what you can do with Siri, however, I don't seem to be using it for more than cooking timers. Everything else I tend to continue doing via the regular way.  Therefore, I'm wondering what you might be using Siri for? What do you do daily with Siri?"
"I don't know what's happened, but for whatever reason as of late, I cannot open Spotify through Siri.  What'll happen is that I'll say ""Hey Siri, open Spotify"" and then she'll respond back with ""Which text?""   Anyone else come across this annoying problem?"
"Hi,
 
 I have a problem with Siri. She doesn‚Äôt hear me that well. I have to speak very loudly and have the iPhone real close to me. Also, the hey Siri function is no longer functioning.

Is there a way to prevent the iPhone screen from turning on when using ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù when using AirPods? It will constantly turn on in my pocket now.
I‚Äôve added my family as sister/mother etc. in my contact card. When using Siri by saying e.g. ‚ÄúCall my sister‚Äù I end up calling myself. Is this a bug or have I done something wrong?  Thanks in advance!
"Hi there.    When using the phrase ‚Äúremind me about this‚Äù in any native application like mail , safari , phonebook etc , Siri will make a reminder with a link to that application and the specific email/page/phone number etc.  This was working for me in the photos as well , but it suddenly stopped.  Also at my wife‚Äôs phone it never worked for photos.  Any ideas?"
"Howdy  I'm pretty new in the Apple thing, I only have an iPad Yeah that's really nothing But I watch videos from iJustine and I recently discovered the HomePod And it seems to be a really great speaker... that is connected. And even if I don't use a lot Siri on my iPad, she seems to be smart (in the light and basic side)  But something has bothered me : Siri (and so the HomePod) seems to ""know"" iJustine music preference a lot through Apple Music. And that triggers me. How does Siri know the music preference of the user ? Beyond just ""like/dislike"" music, there must be something more deep than that.  And I have another question, it concerns privacy. Does Siri always listen to you ? I know that Apple is really putting in front of their pages that they want to make our data as much as private as possible and the minimum of our data is transmitted to their servers, but imagine if the HomePod (or any iDevice that has Siri enabled) is neir of you speaking of something, does Siri (and so Apple) know it ?  Ho and, I have the French version of Siri (because I'm in Belgium and my native language is French) but the English Siri (on the HomePod) of iJustine seems to be more personal... Like... She kinda respond to iJustine when she said ""my God"" when Siri announced a lot of lists she had  I hope that done of you could give me some lights on Siri (and by the way I want a Siri update in iOS 14 it would be so great)"
"Ok, so I use both iPhone and android phones. I love my iPhone and the whole ecosystem, but there‚Äôs one thing that has always made me return to android... Siri!! I drive a lot and use CarPlay or android auto all the time. I‚Äôm also bilingual. So when using android auto if I were to get a message in Spanish, google assistant will read it in Spanish for me and I would be able to reply back to it in Spanish as well. Same thing with English, if I get a English message the assistant would read it in English and I would be able to reply in English. Also when asking random questions she would be able to answer them reading directly from the source. Another thing she can do is receive two commands in a single sentence which is great. For example I can say ‚Äúturn the fan on and set temperature to 70‚Äù, the assistant would turn my fan on and set the A/C to 70 in my house.   Siri on the other hand when receiving a message other than English will read out gibberish and if I were to reply in another language other than English, she would write English words that are similar to what I said. When asking questions, most of the time all she finds are articles where we have to read it in order to find our answer. Lastly, Siri can only do one command at a time and is it wouldn‚Äôt be that distracting if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that you have to say the trigger frase every single time.   I know some is all about privacy and stuff, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing some of my info if it was to make Siri more useful. I‚Äôd love to get that multilingual support."
Mysterious answers if you don't know who/what they are.
Allow me to pick certain songs that won‚Äôt let Siri react while they‚Äôre playing. Sick of trying to sing along to Private Eyes by Hall &amp; Oates and Siri turning on every damn time I get to the chorus! None of the lines even **sound** like I‚Äôm saying ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù
"Hey guys so I have a question. Usually when I have my iPhone and my iPad next to me and call ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù both devices open Siri but then the command only follows trough on my iPhone, or on iPad if it is a bit closer to me than the iPhone is. Is it possible to call for Siri on both devices simultaneously? Or for example if Siri opens on the iPhone is it possible to command her to open the app on the iPad? Cause even tho we have ‚Äúhandsoff‚Äù for apps I find that Siri is really restricted to each device and would be very cool if it crossed them.  Also sorry for any mistake, english is not my main language."
"So I was watching a Mr. Nighmare video (He's a YouTuber who reads scary stories submitted by fans.) and he was reading a story about a guy who was woken up by Siri saying ""It was July 4th, 1776,"" the answer was a response to the question ""What that found for us?"" Now I know it's about the foundation of the US, but since I have Siri, I decided to ask this question, when I did, Siri just closed, I said ""Hello"" to test it, and it was normal, but for someone reason, when I ask ""What that found for us?"" Siri just closes. I found nothing relating to Siri when I looked it up, only stuff relating to the Revolutionary War. I would appreciate all the help I can get, thanks.  TLDR; Siri closes when I say ""What that found for us?"" curious as to why it does that."
Siri what time is UTC?
"When I tell Siri to ""Turn off all the lights"" it (un)helpfully responds ""sorry, I can't operate the lights in your car."" - and does nothing. Because of an imagined car. That I don't have ;)     Did anyone else run into this? Google turned up empty.  Thanks for having a look!"

"When in a car, Siri now displays an automobile image in the background when triggered.  She will navigate using Apple Maps, but refuses to open Spotify. I‚Äôve looked through settings, but haven‚Äôt found anything relevant.   Anyone have any pointers?"
"I've had a couple issues with my AirPods Pro that have mostly been resolved (fingers crossed). I've had to reset and re-pair several replacement pairs. But this evening I noticed that Siri turned itself on once on my iPhone 11, just caught it with the corner of my eye. Odd, I thought. I listen to a lot of music, and sometimes I ask Siri to turn the volume up or down. Tonight, she is 1) sometimes giving me voice feedback and sometimes not and 2) being inconsistent with how long she sticks around. Sometimes she completes the command and goes away; other times she sticks around and the volume is reduced until I say, ""Hey Siri, goodbye"" which is really annoying if I just want the volume turned up or down. This wasn't an issue until today... Unsure if other ppl. have this issue."
"I don‚Äôt remember this ever happening, and I hope I‚Äôm not missing something obvious, but for the last few days, Siri will only answer certain inquiries if I say ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù first. This is true on iPad 7, iPhone XR, Apple Watch 4 and HomePod. I used to be able to hold the sleep/wake button and just ask something like ‚ÄúWho is The Rock?‚Äù and Siri would give an answer. Now, all I get is ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong, try again‚Äù. However, if I say ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù first, then ask, I get the correct response, like a short bio and Wikipedia link.  This happened seemingly random out of nowhere. I updated iOS and HomePod to the 13.5 and 13.4.5 software, same thing. Asking Siri to do stuff on-device like setting alarms works as usual, and I can even get cloud music to play via Apple Music. It‚Äôs definitely not an internet issue, as everything else works fine on WiFi and LTE.  Any suggestions?"
"I say, ""Siri, text xyz what's up?""   Siri says, ""Messages doesn't support the group xyz, what group would you like to send it to?""   I say, ""xyz""   Siri says:  ""Ok, ready to send it?""   It used to happen a little bit, but now it's happening every time.  Any ideas?"
"We have a hospital system in our area with multiple locations. I regularly have to call them as part of my job. As such I‚Äôve put each of them in my contacts.

(I don‚Äôt know why, but seems like my sneeze sounds a lot like ‚ÄúHey, Siri!‚Äù)  So, I fooled around, just because.. and ask Siri in English (my phone is set up in English) ‚ÄúWhat are you doing, Siri?‚Äù  And Siri answered...  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at nutrition facts of almond bla bla bla‚Äù    I mean, it could just be a coincidence, but still..."
"Something really bizarre happened with Siri today, and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like it. My baby was holding my phone, and she must have turned on Siri. I said ""(Daughter's Name), put down the phone."" Siri misheard it as ""GO DEEP DOWN THE PHONE."" This led to a choose-your-own-adventure style story about Goldilocks &amp; the three bears. It first asked you whether you were playing as Papa, Mama, or Baby Bear. When you answered, it asked you whether you wanted to go to the living room, bedroom, or wake up Goldilocks, and it told you a story about what happens with Goldilocks. We repeated this several times to see all the different endings. One ended with Goldi throwing herself out the window, and Baby Bear commenting that she was ""just a kid, like me."" Another ended with Goldi's mom picking her up, and Baby and Goldi staring at each other with regret. It was a bit unsettling, and seemed really strange because A) Who would ever randomly say ""Go deep down the phone"" on purpose; and B) What does that have to do with Goldilocks?  Then, it got really freaky. I texted a few friends to try it. They all got the same thing - the Goldilocks story. I Googled ""SIRI GO DEEP DOWN THE PHONE"" to see if anyone else had discovered this. I got no results, so I posted it on my Facebook page, excited to have discovered a new Easter Egg. A few minutes later, one of my friends who had gotten the Goldilocks story earlier texted me, freaking out because she went to show her husband, and it no longer worked. Siri just said ""I didn't get that."" I tried it again - same thing! ""I didn't get that."" All my friends are now getting the same response.  So my question is...what on Earth happened!?!? Has anyone ever heard of an Easter Egg suddenly disappearing? One of my friends suggested it was maybe written into the code to disable as soon as the phrase was detected online, but to what end? Just to gaslight someone? Interested in hearing your thoughts."
I‚Äôve been asking her if she can tell me the answer to 1 billion to the 11th power but she doesn‚Äôt say the full number. Is there any way I can get her to do this?
"I haven't used Siri a alot although I have has an iPhone since 5. However, now I set up an old one as a ""Kitchen Aid"" thingy. However, I can't really figure out how to dismiss alarms and such.  If I set up a cooking alarm, say ""Hi Siri, set a timer for 15 minutes."", after 15mins it'll ring, but how do I dismiss the notification? How do I \*stop\* it from ringing after I have already noticed the alarm? I can of course go and touch the phone, but that's really awkward and frankly a stupid solution for a problem like this."
"when I tell Siri to ""play previous song"" Siri just goes back to the beginning of the current song, not the previous track.  Any tips? I cant believe this oversight on both Apple and Spotify's part. Criminal."
"So this morning I woke up and went to ask Siri what time it was, I had only gotten ‚Äòhey Siri‚Äô out before she responded. Her response was a bit startling and I haven‚Äôt been able to get her to say it again.   After saying ‚Äòhey Siri‚Äô she responded with  ‚ÄòI am right, you are right, all is right that is right.‚Äô   This was at 4 o‚Äôclock in the morning and I couldn‚Äôt go back to bed afterwards lol.   Anyone have any ideas why she would say this or have a similar experience?"
"    Hello! I‚Äôm a researcher from the University of Liverpool, UK. We are currently researching virtual assistants like Siri and how they relate to employment and Accent.  We are investigating this to analyse how useful and beneficial virtual assistants like Siri are at work, and also to analyse the commonly reported problem of people with certain accents finding it harder for virtual assistants to interpret their commands.  Once we have collected enough data it will be forwarded to the R&amp;D divisions of all the relevant companies, like Apple. So if you help us out you may actually have an impact on how virtual assistants are designed!

Confused to what is causing siri to give time lengths or dates to the situation. One belief is that it has to do with 0-2400 hour times ? But other people get actual date answers ? Someone check according to asking it when does 2021 end and so forth please.
"So I have a room with two devices. A lamp and a light.  I named the devices Family Room Light and Family Room Lamp  I say to Siri, turn on the family room light and both turn on. This changed a few days ago (or even just a day ago). I was able to say turn on the family room light and ONLY the light turned on.   Ok ok. I know, both devices are set as lights in HomeKit so why shouldn‚Äôt they go on, right?  Well that‚Äôs not how it was working just last week.    What do you all say (or use) for the names of a lamp and a light in the same room?"
When I try to tell her something it won‚Äôt respond like the line at the bottom would just cut off immediately when I touch that button it would hear me but cut off? Help?
I use the bedtime feature on my phone everyday but my sleep schedule keeps on changing. Every night before I go to sleep I have to change my bedtime hours accordingly. All I want to know is that if there is any way by which I can change my bedtime hours through Siri. Any help would be much appreciated.
"I've been using Siri more and more, just about everywhere. She's pretty amazing.  One thing I often do is walk away from my desk (MacBook Pro with external monitor) and want to turn off the screen without waiting for it to sleep.  Do we know if it's at all possible to do this? Maybe a shortcut, app, integration, something?  Thanks!"
"I‚Äôm having issues with pairing my iPhone with my 2016 Ford Fusion. The pairing process seems to go ok, but I can‚Äôt hear Siri talking whenever I activate her.   I noticed on the lower right of the Siri screen, there‚Äôs a Bluetooth icon. I clicked on it, and noticed that there‚Äôs two instances of Sync listed. I‚Äôm unable to select the top listing, but I‚Äôm thinking this  is why I‚Äôm unable to hear Siri. Has anyone else had this happen, and how did you fix it?

"I use alarms with vibration only and timer with some soothing sound, but every time I set any of those using Siri it plays the default annoying extra loud sound that scares the shit outta me when I forget to change it manually. Really pisses me off. Checked all the settings, didn‚Äôt  find anything. Am I dumb or do they really not have an option to change it? That would be a shame"
I tried a ton of colors with Siri to see which ones she understands. You can use these with HomeKit to change Light colors. Check them out here. The list is pretty large.   [https://smarthomeexplained.com/siri-light-colors/](https://smarthomeexplained.com/siri-light-colors/)

Can you make siri not be able to text a contact?
"When I ask siri to read messages when on silent, it puts a yes/no question on the screen.  This is kinda useless because I usually do it while driving and can't look at the screen.  This used to work but I just switched to a new phone so I'm not sure if that's when the changed or there was a SW release that changed this.  I can't find any settings to override this new behavior.  Anyone know how to get around this?"
I really like this feature   I have it set automatically when I go to sleep every night at certain time.   But I really like when it sees I have a meeting and asks me if I would like to go into DND(do not disturb).   But I find it doesn‚Äôt always come up on my screen. Also I would love this to automatically happen so I didn‚Äôt always have to turn it on?   Can anyone help/advise on this?
But why the heck do I need to unlock my iPhone first before Siri will tell me the weather? Is there a workaround that I‚Äôm missing? It must be something stupid easy that I‚Äôm overlooking.
"I can't really find a solid answer, some say that charging it overnight and keeping it plugged in even at 100% will damage the battery in the long run, some say newer phones (I have the iPhone XR) automatically stop charging at 100% and it won't damage the phone or battery if plugged in past 100%  Anyone here got a solid answer?"

"Siri battery drain issue. What to do?  Hello.  I had no problem with my IPhone X, but when I recently upgraded to IPhone XR this problem started. I posted the pictures [here](https://imgur.com/a/MXF23l3). I factory reset my phone after 2 days of Siri draining my battery in half a day. It did not resolve the issue. I am desperate. What is there to do, because it frustrates me extremely.A phone is for you to resolve problems, make your life easier, but this is exactly the opposite. What can i do?"
"When I tell Siri ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how you pronounce it‚Äù when pulling up someone‚Äôs contact, it doesn‚Äôt save the new pronunciations. Is this just for me or are others having this issue?"
"I can't  be the only one having this problem. Everyday I use Bluetooth in my car to use Waze for directions to and from work. While the map is up, if I ask Siri to play a playlist or song, or whatever, after she finishes with the command, the screen stays on the Siri response screen instead of going back to Waze. How can I fix this?"
"On my Bf iPhone XR Siri will randomly activate, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs voice command related or a bug of sort. But it does coincidentally activate when he was saying something but nothing close to ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù   This hasn‚Äôt been a one time thing. I have witnessed it at least a handful with him plus more that he has seen too on top   Will toggling the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù feature off and on again, will that correct the issue do you think?   We haven‚Äôt been able to replicate it, and often forget what was said out of surprise"
I was sitting in my bed with my bf while my phone was charging on my desk. All of a sudden the Siri voice suddenly says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pondering eternity and it‚Äôs taking forever‚Äù and my bf and I both froze looking at each other. When we looked at my phone there was no Siri chat history of her saying anything like that and when I looked it up nothing came up. Is it possible my phones been hacked? I honestly can‚Äôt think of any explanation. We weren‚Äôt talking so I can‚Äôt think of anything that would‚Äôve triggered Siri to come on
"I copied her settings of language USA English, with British accent, but I can‚Äôt get my Siri on iPhone XR to say anything more than ¬´¬†I‚Äôm here etc¬†¬ª.   She doesn‚Äôt have AirPods, or any other Apple device.   Anyone know why hers responds like that?"
"Weird thing started happening recently.   I can no longer use Siri to change my Ecobee 3 thermostat settings. HomeKit scenes and manual on-screen adjustment still work just fine, but Siri just responds with, **‚ÄúSorry, I wasn't able to find anything like that in your Home this time.‚Äù**  I've tried ""change the temperature to... "" ""set the thermostat to..."" and ""set the Ecobee to..."" and get the same result.  Anyone else experienced this?"
"For the past week or so, any request to Siri to play a song, artist, album or playlist from my music library, just fails.  She recognises the artist or track name because it gets capitalised but then she says  ""Sorry, I'm having trouble with the connection. Please try again.""  I've tried a settings reset, I even switched to a new phone but this is still failing on iOS 13.3.1  Anyone have a similar experience or any idea how I can fix this?"
"I have Siri read me my texts through my AirPods when my phone is locked. However instead of pausing my audio when she‚Äôs reading, she just makes it quieter. Not only does that make it harder to make out what Siri is saying, but if I‚Äôm listening to a podcast I miss a good 20 seconds of it. Is there an option I can turn on to make her complete pause audio while she‚Äôs active, and resume it when she‚Äôs done?"

"First level Apple support doesn‚Äôt know what to make of this. This has been going on for multiple major releases but I can‚Äôt get it escalated until I upgrade from 13.1 to whatever the current release is, 13.3?  I triggered Siri and said:  Create alarm labeled call for a ride to the store because I‚Äôm too tired to walk  Siri correctly transcribed what I said, properly recognizing the contraction for ‚ÄúI am‚Äù and the adjective ‚Äútoo‚Äù on the screen.  However, when asking for when I wanted the alarm to alert me, look at what happened to the label I had provided:  Set the ‚Äòa ride to the store because I‚Äôm too tired‚Äô alarm for when?  Why? Siri had heard what I said as my request was perfectly presented on the display. When using the  alarm app I‚Äôve never had the label changed on me.  I‚Äôm pretty sure it was changed by Siri because Siri  clearly does some statefull inspection of the text.  For example, Siri has replied to some alarm labels along the lines of ‚Äúcreate alarm labeled leave for dinner at Friday‚Äôs‚Äù by relying with something along the lines of ‚ÄúI cannot set an alarm for a particular day. Would you like for me to set up a reminder instead?‚Äú  The changes do not appear to be related to the length of the label. In addition, telling it quote label name quote Will indeed result in ‚Äúlabel name‚Äù but it may still mince the label.  Try some for yourself and see what happens.  Any thoughts or suggestions?"

"I‚Äôve requested Siri to ‚ÄúNotify [user‚Äôs name] when I arrive at my destination‚Äù while I‚Äôve had Apple Maps directing me to a destination. I have always gotten the response   ‚ÄúHmm... the Find My Service isn‚Äôt responding right now.‚Äù    This implies to me that the request is a valid phrase, however, has been occurring since iOS 12.

"Does anyone know if there are any updates coming up for Siri?   I have to text a lot for my job and when I use Siri it is so inaccurate I end up spending more time fixing the text than it would have taken to just type it.

"A couple of days ago Siri stopped reading text messages out loud in CarPlay. It will open the message, say ""So-and-so says..."" and then there's silence where the text should be, then it prompts me with ""Would you like to respond?""  I've asked it to do other things like tell me the weather or name the capital of my state, so I know that Siri is mostly working and it's not a volume issue. Anyone else having a similar problem?"
"I often try to watch specific shows on Netflix by asking Siri, but getting no help from it. Is there a shortcut I can make or a way to do more then just open the app?"
"Anyone else experience Siri announcing messages in a very low volume, even when volume on AirPods is up high?"
We have only noticed this when using CarPlay. Normally we don‚Äôt have Siri read our messages. If we get a text ‚ÄúHa Ha Ha‚Äú sometimes when Siri is reading the text it will emphasize the last HA with a higher pitched voice and increase speed like it is laughing. But most of the time it drones the words in a regular voice.  We have tried to duplicate this several times and cannot. Is it just a random event or is there a way we can make Siri laugh?
"This used to work but suddenly stopped and I can‚Äôt find the option to turn it on anywhere in settings, how can I fix this?"
"I just got an iPhone 11, and it‚Äôs great except that when I use Hey Siri in my car, connected to the car Bluetooth (2013 Prius c), I can‚Äôt hear Siri talk. I see that this has a separate volume level, but I now have it all the way up (in fact Siri indicates that her volume is at max if I ask her to talk louder, but only in the text on screen). My old iPhone 7 would switch to the Hands Free Bluetooth when I used Hey Siri (like for calls) and that worked, but with this phone it still seems to be using Bluetooth audio (for music) for Hey Siri and it makes no sound. All I get is the text on screen. I‚Äôve tried unpairing and re-pairing and I‚Äôve also tried turning Siri off and back on. Nothing helps. Is anyone else running into this problem and has anyone found a solution?  It's also worth noting that music plays fine and even Apple Maps Siri voice works fine over the Bluetooth audio, but not Hey Siri. I‚Äôm at my wits ends here."
"Yesterday I started a free trial of Apple Music and I guess I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out how to word my problem, because I‚Äôm not finding much about it while searching the web.   Until today, if I asked Siri (while using CarPlay) to play whatever song or artist, it would play. Today I tried asking for a song or artist and Siri would reply ‚ÄúSorry, you‚Äôre not on Wifi and haven‚Äôt enabled cellular data.‚Äù The songs I want to listen to are all on my phone...I don‚Äôt need Siri to search Apple Music for them. How do I make Siri play music from my library?   I have not yet synced my library with Apple Music because I‚Äôm not sure I want to keep the service and, when I tried to match my songs with Google Play Music a couple years ago, there were a lot of songs that Google just plain got wrong, and it was kind of a pain to fix. It was hard to determine out of thousands of songs, which ones were missing because Google thought they were completely different songs I‚Äôve never even heard of. (And for what it‚Äôs worth, I do use MusicBrainz Picard.)"
"My dad is tetraplegic and cannot move his fingers. I am wondering if there is a way to get Siri to answer incoming phone calls on an iPhone 8? Is there a way to unlock your iPhone using Siri?

"So this thing have just happened a few weeks ago, whenever I ask Siri to play music or search for one, Siri would tell me to wait, delay for a long period of time and then report that I'm having a network connection problem, despite that I can manually open the song in Apple Music easily. At first I thought that was just an update bug (currently at IOS 13.3), but turns out it's not since my friend's Siri still work fine.   Have a research on the Internet about fixing it but nothing worked for me. Anyone in the same situation?"
"Is Siri supposed to change its voice on all iCloud linked devices if you make a change on one device?   I use the male Siri voice on my iPhone, but on my MBP, I use the female voice. I upgraded my MBP OS and when complete, the voice changed to the male Siri. Not a problem. I changed it back to the female Siri voice.   When I invoked Siri on my iPhone later that day, to my surprise, its voice was now female Siri voice as well?"
"So i asked Siri to search for a song it was playing, and it did so using shazam in the background. I thought it wouldve been saved, so i locked the phone. Now I cannot find where to see my history.. is there a way to go back at it or is that gone forever?"

"Is there a way to get Siri to read incoming text messages without Airpods or CarPlay? I want my phone (8 on iOS 13.3) to read my texts aloud while driving, ideally with a prompt for me to respond with voice, but I do not have CarPlay. Thanks!"
"I don't own an iPhone, but the majority of my family does. When they go to text me, they say ""Hey Siri, text *name* (message)"". Unfortunately I tend to go by the shorter version of my name, one that is also a noun and/or a verb. To combat this, my mother has changed my contact to ""My Son *name*"" and that actually does work, but not consistently. Is there any way to make Siri recognize my name as a name, and not as a verb or noun? Note that this was working completely fine until around March or April this year."
"first i noticed,  ‚Äúhey, siri, call dad, work.‚Äù  *calling dad, mobile.*  ‚Äúhey, siri, facetime audio [brother].‚Äô‚Äô  *who would you like to facetime?*  ‚Äúhey, siri, call billy.‚Äù  *hmm. i don‚Äôt seem to have any information for billy. would you like to call [phone number] for billy?*  same set-up, same airpods as the week prior. totally different (unuseful, especially for hands off) results."
"My mam asked me if I wanted out form the shops, I said just loo roll, she replied anything else? And I was driving so I asked Siri to say back that is all I want Xxx but the dabmed bloke said that all i want sex sex sex, so me mam thinks I am a weirdo now thanks Siri"
Is there any way to trigger Siri remotely? Specifically from a different building?   Thanks guys!

On the screen it says ""What can I help you with,"" and then ""Go ahead, I'm listening.""  Even though the waveforms react when the Siri buttons is pressed, I tested the microphone with Voice Memos. It seems to work.  I restored my phone as a new phone, thinking that would fix the issue. It didn't.  When I'm in the car and the phone is connected to CarPlay through lighting, Siri does work when I press the button on the steering wheel to activate voice commands. Siri also works when I connect my BeatsX over Bluetooth.  I noticed at the same time this started that my Battery Health says ""Service"" even though maximum capacity is at 94%.  This is a launch day iPhone X that has never been serviced, submerged in water, or dropped.  I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar issue, and if the battery message may be related to Siri only working with CarPlay and Bluetooth."
I have xs max and its battery health 97% does this affect the performance of it ?
Do this right now:  1) Change your Siri voice to Australian (Female)  2) Send yourself a text message that ends in haha (no spaces)  3) Have Siri read this message to you  4) ...  5) Profit  Why does this happen? You don't know.
Hey guys how do you actually make Siri respond with uh huh when you command it? It works for my iPhone 11 but not for my friends iPhone SE. Is there anything to do with the model or settings?
"I often use Siri to identify songs I hear. Apple uses Shazam to ID songs, and none of my ‚ÄúShazamed‚Äù songs actually show up in my Shazam app. Instead, I have to follow the process detailed below to view my shazamed songs. Does anyone know how to get these songs to show up in my Shazam app rather than go through the process below? **How to Locate Your Siri Shazam History.** Inside of the iTunes Store app, tap on the three-dash menu at the top right, then hit the ""Siri"" tab. You'll see a list of all the songs that Siri has ever identified for you, as well as a button to purchase each one from iTunes."
"Hey, we have a doggo named Hoshi, and our devices constantly think when we say ""Hoshi"" that we are saying ""Hey Siri"".  I have my doubts... but if anyone has a trick to teach Siri the difference between Hoshi and Hey Siri i'd love to hear them.  Unfortunately, little miss Hoshi is quite the trouble maker so we are forever calling out her name, usually followed by 'stop chewing that' which confuses the hell out of Siri I have to say."
"I.e. if I ask her at 6:00:31, is the alarm set for 6:10:31 or 6:11:00??  Specifically because i'm cooking and obviously time is important. Would prefer timers over alarms but she can only set one at a time.   Thanks"
"Me: Hey Siri, did the Saints win?  Siri: The Saints lost a close battle with San Francisco...  Me: Hey Siri, that sucks.  Siri: Tell me about it."
"I find myself asking her to control things at work, the hotel shower, devices in my car, etc.  She is a hard ha it too break."
"So after I updated my iPhone7 to iOS 13 I found out that sometimes when I call Siri, it would beep then just vanish. I have to give it a second call to make it listen to whatever I say. This happened for so many times that it‚Äôs becoming pretty annoying. Come on, Siri is already dumb so don‚Äôt make it even worse, Apple. Have any of you guys experienced this?"
"I got my new iPhone 11 yesterday, and Siri can‚Äôt be heard over my cars Bluetooth. I can hear her perfectly when I tell her to play a podcast, she says one moment, then podcast plays perfectly. But ask her the weather or to read my latest message and I can‚Äôt hear her. I can see her words on the screen, but can‚Äôt hear. Then she freezes and won‚Äôt turn off and my car radio is also frozen and won‚Äôt work until I turn off my phone manually. Yes her volume is all the way up and switch is on.   My iPhone 7 doesn‚Äôt have this issue, Siri is loud and clear. My sons se doesn‚Äôt have this issue, Siri is loud and clear.   I‚Äôm back to using my 7, and will be returning  my 11 unless there is a magic fix for this."
When I ask Siri to dial a Moble number she no longer puts it on speaker!  When I ask Siri to tell me a story all she does now is tell me I don‚Äôt understand....  Are these issues ever going to be fixed or improved upon?
"I have siri commands setup for our home automation stuff.. I'm using globe suite plugs, which run off a app my my phone, which allows me to sent shortcuts to siri. Is there a way I can use those same commands with my mac, or would I need globe suite app on my computer as well??"
"All I want is for Siri to be able to recognize and respond to my ""thank you""s after she does something for me. I'm so nice to her but she can't even here me."
"Hello, Reddit community! I‚Äôve bought a brand new iPhone X and it has been 3 weeks since then. I recently new about the option being able to see your battery health percentage. Surprisingly, the first time I checked, the battery health percentage was 93%. Eventually, it kept lowering down within a week. It is currently at 91% right now. I‚Äôm starting to get really conscious and irritated about it.  Question: Is there any way to increase the battery health percentage? If not, what are the things I should be doing and NOT be doing to maintain the current status?  Thank you!"
"Every time I ask Siri for ‚ÄúFood near me‚Äù she always gives me restaurants located in China... I called an Apple representative to try and fix this but nothing seems to work. Anyone else having this issue/knows a solution? (I‚Äôm in Ohio, for reference)"
My friend told me he knew how to make Siri say OK boomer so I was asked him how and here‚Äôs what he told me  First you have to say to Siri ‚ÄúKnock Knock‚Äù After that say ‚Äúwho‚Äôs there‚Äù After she tells you the first name just say ‚ÄúWho is Ariadna Grande‚Äù  Then she will say OK Boomer
"I use Siri in my daily life, also at work to assist with some definitions, translations, weather and such.  I'm usually listening to music at work, on low volume (with AirPods in). When I activate Siri, the music volume goes to 100%, deafening me. I understand that Siri needs to have an elevated voice even if the volume is low, but should it also affect music volume?  After use, it goes back to the previous volume. I haven't tested it with the iPhone speakers yet."
"I already changed my nickname and everything, but Siri never even says my name. Every time I say hey Siri it just says what can I help you with? Or things like that but it never says my name. Is there anyway I can make it so it says my name every time I say ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù or is there anything I can say so it‚Äôll respond with my name? Besides ‚Äúwhat is my name‚Äù"
"Hey all, sorry if this doesn't belong here but I just wanted to let everyone know I'm running a 50% off IAP promotion from now through November 30th as a Thanksgiving special. My app [Just Timers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-timers/id1453573845?ls=1&amp;mt=8) lets you create multiple, named timers, perfect for cooking a feast! It's free to download, with an In-App Purchase to unlock unlimited timers. I figured plenty of folks will need to keep track of all of the various foods cooking, and just wanted to help out.   The app has a companion watch app that syncs your timers from your phone and lets you create new ones on the watch. I have some big plans coming down in the future including interval timers and cloud sync, as well as making the app a standalone watch app.   There is also support for Siri Shortcuts, so just ask Siri to ""start turkey"" or ""start potatoes"" to trigger your preset timers, hands-free!  I hope you enjoy, any feedback is appreciated!"
"So I am getting extremely fed up with my phone. Since downloading iOS 13, and all of the subsequent updates (I am on the latest iOS) Siri has not been working. I will say ‚Äúhey siri‚Äù and give my request, and it just spins telling me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on it‚Äù and ‚Äújust one minute‚Äù and then gives me the ‚Äúsomething is wrong, try back later‚Äù warning. My watch is doing the exact same thing. I have googled this and it seems like I am the only person with this problem.   I have tried all the suggested fixes like hard rebooting my phone, turning Siri off and on, resetting network connections and so on. Can anyone recommend a fix. I feel like my phone is almost worthless without the ability to use Siri. Thank you."
Has anyone else had the problem with AirPods Pro where when Siri announces new messages while music is playing the volume of the music increases so you can‚Äôt even hear her?  It only happens with music. Was playing a podcast and the volume of the podcast didn‚Äôt change.   Is there a setting for this or is it a bug?
"When you send a text message to someone using siri, she Say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúSend‚Äù to send the message. Or say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù or ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù to cancel the message. And this happens just by the slightes pause, so im wondering if its a way to contue the Message or if you have to start over again.     This is for my handicapped aunt, thanks"
"I run a small delivery service and one of the really frustrating things that pops up occasionally is I‚Äôll put an address in that exists in the city in which I work. Siri will ignore the fact that I‚Äôm located in one place and give me directions to someplace 500 km away that happens to have the same address. It is so stupid.   It means when I‚Äôm on the road and dictating a destination I occasionally have to pull off the road to manually type the address in because every time I dictate if she wants me to drive 500 km.  I do my best to be hands-free across-the-board but sometimes it‚Äôs impossible because Siri is so poorly written.  I‚Äôm ranting I think, I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs any solution for this. It is almost as frustrating as having to repeatedly retype the same word because Siri has absolutely zero ability to learn."
"I just found this Easter egg today, and I have not found any mention of it on the internet.  If you say go die in a hole, go die, or something else like that three times to Siri, she  give normal responses the first two times but on the third one she says ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù and then Siri closes itself."
Why is it when I have full bars to the cell tower Siri tells me she can‚Äôt connect try later?
"iPhone battery saving tip: check your most used apps in Settings &gt; Battery, then turn off ‚ÄúSiri &amp; Search &gt; Learn from this app‚Äù in those apps."
"When I ask Siri what my name is she says that she dosnt know and I need to update it in contacts, but below that she still displays my contact info. When I go to the settings and set someone else as me then put it back to me it works for a bit, but then after 5 minutes it goes back to not knowing me. Any help?"
"I have multiple garage doors connected to my HomeKit through the Chamberlain MyQ system.  The doors are named as Garage Door 1, Garage Door 2, etc.  When using a Siri command, open Garage Door 1 the reply is ‚Äúyou have more than one garage door in this home, ask me again with a specific room or device name.‚Äù  If I use the Siri command open Garage Door number 1 the reply is ‚Äúsorry I can‚Äôt do that for you.‚Äù    I have tried to rename them with the pound sign and there is no difference.    I have renamed them to Garage Door Left and Garage Door Right which Siri can understand but I have 4 doors total and would prefer them to be numbered.    Any ideas on how to fix or properly give the Siri command?  Thank you!"
"Hi r/Siri,   I am currently working on a project for my UX class where I am tasked with making Siri more accessible and improving the experience when using Siri overall. To do so, I am gathering more information on how people use Siri and how often.

"Did everyone know this already? I always end up going to Settings &gt; \*scrolling\* &gt; Passwords and Accounts &gt; Website &amp; App Passwords &gt; \*type website name\* to find a password, this is so much better!"
"In the past, I'd be able to ask Siri ""what's on my calendar?"" and she would tell me, without me having to pick up the phone or enter the pass code. Recently (since an iOS update?), her response is ""You'll have to unlock your iPhone first."" How can I make it work like it used to?"
"So you know that TikTok where Siri calls someone a nick name like    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahhahahahahahaaaaaa  Can someone type that out for me, so I can do that?"
I have my contact information in there and the Siri setting showing that I own this phone. My coworkers all are having the same problem.   I know for a fact I‚Äôve tried this in the past on this phone and it has worked. Software glitch?
"For over a year I‚Äôve used my homepods daily. One thing ƒ∞ do regularly is ask daily about the weather and my calendar to decide what to wear for the day. Lately ƒ∞ find ƒ∞ almost automatically ask for the weather and realise when Siri‚Äôs done with the report that ƒ∞ have no idea what it contained and ƒ∞ have to ask again. It‚Äôs almost like my brain knows this isn‚Äôt a human, it‚Äôs not going to be offended, you can filter it out... even tho it‚Äôs helpful information that I‚Äôm actually asking for."
"My wife and sister in law have the same first and last name (I‚Äôll call them both Kate Middleton here), and a different middle name. When I try to use Siri to call one, I‚Äôll say ‚ÄúHey Siri, call Kate Michelle Middleton‚Äù  and Siri will say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see Kate Michelle Middleton in your contacts, who would you like to call?‚Äù I reply with ‚ÄúKate Middleton‚Äù and Siri will say ‚Äúcalling Kate Michelle Middleton‚Äù.  Is this normal and expected?! Is there any way to fix this? This has been happening to me for years on multiple iOS versions and I‚Äôm kind of sick of it.   Let me know if I should post somewhere else. Thanks!"
"Anyone else bothered when asking Siri the weather and she says ‚Äúsome bad weather coming up‚Äù ... I don‚Äôt like hearing that the weather is ‚Äúbad‚Äù, I live in a cold place and have to hear her say that the weather is ‚Äúbad‚Äù daily. Very bothersome!"
"I remember on a previous ios, when you activated siri there would be a little noise.   I've just upgraded to an iPhone 11, running ios 13.   When I long press the side button to activate siri there is no noise.   Until I look at the phone I don't know if I've activated siri or just locked it.   Any way to have auditory or haptic feedback on when siri is activated?"
" I have a set up which has a Vizio TV with built-in Chromecast and use my iphone to cast youtube on it. Often when I play music this way, ‚Äúhey siri‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work properly. The phone would listen for a few second then stop, instead of listen for the whole phrase. I tried casting music through Airplay, siri is working perfectly fine. Does anyone having the same problem? Thanks"
Earlier I was talking to some people and heard the Siri sound go off and saw that Siri was listening. I know I wasn‚Äôt holding the side button because my phone was silenced so it wouldn‚Äôt have made the noise. The strange thing was that Siri hadn‚Äôt picked up ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù as the start of the command like it would if it had accidentally been triggered. Does anyone know how this happens?
"When I had Amazon Music Unlimited, I could say, ""Alexa, play Marketplace"" and NPR's Kai Ryssdal's baritone voice would play on whatever device I was using at the time -- Echo Dot, iPhone, etc.  But now that I switched to Apple Music, it seems like Siri can't handle requests to play NPR programs. Say it ain't so! Tell me there's a way to access NPR programming on my iPhone using Siri."
"Just ask it- ""Hey Siri, what's the weather in New York, New York?"" Its pronunciation almost makes it sound like ""Newark""."
Is there a fix for Siri reminder call actions? In ios12 when you say ‚Äúremind me to call my wife ‚Äú Siri creates an action with the phone icon that you push and iPhone sets the call. In iOS 13 (for me at least) this helpful feature is gone.  Anybody with the same issue?  Thanks
I have an iPhone 8 version 13.1  Recently in the last few weeks Siri won‚Äôt turn off my alarm. Siri says ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do that right now.‚Äô Or sometimes Siri will say It can‚Äôt do that right now but I will silence alarms.‚Äô  I‚Äôve never had a problem with turning off alarms using Siri before the 13 update. Help?
"Hey everyone,  I'm looking for some help or information on what's the best way to have Siri activate in all my Apple devices, or perhaps just comments on how you use it if you own multiple Apple devices. I own iPhone, Watch and the new Airpods, so I'm not sure if it's worth having Siri on in all of them or if I should stick to iPhone or Watch only.  I guess I'm trying to understand Siri within Apple ecosystem, looking for an efficient way to interact with it but doesn't overlay among devices, or feels redundant.  Thanks for your help."
My nieces name is Nilah (Nye-luh) but Siri pronounces it like Nilla. I‚Äôve done the ‚ÄúSiri you‚Äôre pronouncing Nilah wrong‚Äù twice and corrected him but when I say ‚ÄúCall Nilah‚Äù hell still say ‚ÄúCalling Nilla‚Äù idk what else I can do to try and correct it
"TL;DR Is there a way to change Siri's iOS 13 responses back to or more similar to iOS 12 responses?  It seems they've shortened a lot of Siri's feedback responses with iOS 13. I've noticed it particularly with setting reminders. Siri used to confirm your reminder by repeating it back to you, but no longer does.  iOS 12:  ""Set a reminder at 1730"", ""What would you like me to remind you about?"", ""Pick up dog food"", ""Ok, I've set a reminder 'Pick up dog food' for today at 1730.""   iOS 13:  ""Set a reminder at 1730"", ""What would you like me to remind you about?"", ""Pick up dog food"", ""Ok, I set your reminder for this afternoon.""  I like the fact that Siri would repeat the reminder back to me, because it confirms I spoke properly and Siri understood me. Does anyone have any idea how to turn this feature back on? I've used my Google-foo to no avail, and digging through the *Siri &amp; Search* brings up zilch."
"It‚Äôs incredibly annoying and first started with iOS 13.   I‚Äôd hoped iOS 13.2 would have fixed it, but nope."
"I‚Äôve been using Siri for many years now, dictating voice messages, dictating Reddit posts, dictating emails, asking for directions, you name it. I‚Äôve noticed recently ridiculous errors in dictation, almost like there is no contextual recognition anymore, has anybody else noticed this?   It seems especially bad since I upgraded to an iPhone XR so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs related, I‚Äôve used many different models over the years so I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs some kind of database that needs to be cleared or if they tweak the settings and it just sucks now. Like in this very post, where and I said iPhone XR it wrote iPhone EXR, Shouldn‚Äôt Apple no there isn‚Äôt such a model? I didn‚Äôt even say the letter E! I just said the ladders (letters ffs!!) EXR, but it decides to use Ex as an ex-wife or something."

Is there a counter out there that records how many people have said ‚Äúshut up bitch‚Äù or something similar when Siri activates randomly? Late night thoughts.

"When you go to an app configuration there is this option at the bottom that says ""Use with Ask Siri"". I'm pretty sure that having this on will enable app specific commands with Siri, but there are 3 things that are bothering me:  1) I had to check every app to see if it had this option and manually enable them, why did I never get a popup asking if I wanted to use it with Siri in the first place? It sucks to check every app to see if Siri can work with them;  2) I started to look for this option after I heard that Spotify could be controlled with Siri, but that's one of the few apps that the option was already toggled on. I never accepted a notification to use Siri with Spotify, anyone knows why or how iOS decides which apps should have this option turned on by default?  3) Probably the most important question: Is there a way to know what commands I can say for that specific app?"
Ever since I updated to iOS 13.2 I haven‚Äôt been able to hear Siri when she responds. Anyone now how to fix this?
"For a recent personal project, I needed to invoke Siri from the macOS terminal command line. It's part of a home automation thing, and I wanted my computer to invoke Siri on it's own. Here's how I did it.  Step one: Enable ""Type to Siri"" (System Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Siri). I also changed Siri's keyboard shortcut to ""Press Fn (Function) Space"" (System Preferences &gt; Siri). The other keyboard shortcut options require you to ""Hold"" a key, which can be done, but it makes things a bit trickier.  Step two: install [Cliclick](https://www.bluem.net/en/projects/cliclick/). Cliclick is a great (and free) tool for triggering mouse and keyboard events via the command line.  With that done, I can invoke Siri from the command line with something like this:  `$ cliclick kd:fn kp:space ku:fn w:250 t:""turn on the living room lights"" kp:return`  Going a step further, if you are familiar with [terminal aliases and functions](https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/beginners-guide-to-terminal-aliases-and-functions), you can create a ""siricli"" function:      siricli(){              cliclick kd:fn kp:space ku:fn w:250 t:""$1"" kp:return          }  Open a new terminal window after adding that function, and now you can invoke Siri like this:  `$ siricli ""turn on the living room lights""`"
"Running iOS 13.1.2 and HomePod 12.4, asking Siri to ‚ÄòLove this song‚Äô playing from Apple Music results in an ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand: love this song‚Äù but if I say ‚Äòlike this song‚Äô, she gets it right and marks the song as loved.  Given the wording on AM is ‚Äòloved‚Äô and ‚Äòunlove‚Äô this is pretty confusing.   Happening for anyone else? I have one phone on 13.2 beta."
"I would like to know how you can get Siri to read content and not simply show a list or prompt me to touch the screen. I'm a quadriplegic with [muscular dystrophy](http://muscle.ca/discover-md/what-is-muscular-dystrophy/)  and I find if really difficult to get myself a list of all new streaming media content on services like Netflix or amazon prime, since I last asked Siri?   Currently Siri isn't at all helpful  to me when it displays content on the screen that requires me to touch, tap or otherwise swipe the screen to read the content.   Thoughts?"

Ever since IOS 13 came out I‚Äôve had a huge problem with Siri. I‚Äôll ask her to play a specific song that I don‚Äôt have downloaded on my phone such as ‚Äúthank u next‚Äù by Ariana grande or ‚Äúthere nothing holdin‚Äô me back‚Äù my Shawn mendes and I‚Äôm always met with ‚Äúsure here‚Äôs some *insert artist here* ‚Äúor ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find this song in your music.‚Äù On iOS 12 I did not have this problem. I‚Äôve asked in several different ways like ‚Äúsearch for this song on Apple Music‚Äù and still no help. This is really frustrating especially when I‚Äôm driving and I want to hear a certain song and I‚Äôm met with either music that I don‚Äôt listen to or no music at all.
I have an iPhone 8 but upgrading to iOS13 didn‚Äôt upgrade Siri‚Äôs voice to neural text to speech. That got me wondering which iPhone models actually got the update. Did you get it ?

"So, i have a problem with Siri that i cannot understand. My SO bought an iPhone XR a couple of weeks ago, and i have noticed something peculiar. We both have Hey Siri activated on our own phones, i own an iPhone Xs and they are supposedly trained to respond to our own voices (so i trained mine, she trained hers).   Problem is, when my SO says Hey Siri, she only triggers her phone. But when i say Hey Siri, i trigger both my phone and hers, the Siri screen appears on both of them for a brief second, then after a super short time the chime comes in on one of them that takes my command. It is super annoying because sometimes she is on her phone, browsing the internet, then i come in the room, I say ""Hey Siri"" to my phone so i can control the lights with HomeKit, but instead her phone chimes, and triggers the response. Mine just sits there, and it is annoying because it interrupts her every time. If her phone is not in the room, then my Xs respons just fine, super fast.   So basically, when i ""Hey Siri"", there is a 50/50 chance to trigger both my phone and my SO's phone. We retrained them a couple of times, turned off Hey Siri, even performed a general reset on both phones. Retrained them alone, in different rooms, so no interference there. What is the matter with this? How can we resolve this issue?"

"So on the day of Apple's annual world's biggest announcement, I'm reminded that Siri sux.  Alexa far superior.  Tried to set appointment on MBA three times - response is 'Something's wrong"";  DUH  Try same thing from iPad - Sets up appointment alright - loaded with code like:  Trouble scheduling with {""homophones"";\[{""value"":""John Doe"", confidenceScore"":694.0}  try Alexa set appointment for thursday at six pm with John Doe works fine on exact same calendar.  &amp;#x200B;  Reminds me of how  commoditized Apple products have become.  Used to be one could count on AAPL for reliability and honesty.  Apple replaced my 7s (2-radio phone) with a 7s single radio phone.  I didn't discover it for a year until I went to switch carriers.  Spent 3 visits in apple store with manager, at least 3 cases opened up with Customer relations with no response as promised.  Not even a 'No"".    At one point, the store manager told me that if I had discovered during the warranty period, they would have taken care of it.  SInce when does warranty have to do with a problem with the sale?  This was an accidental switch when the phone was replaced.     This lack of response is not an accident, tho.  So Apple admits there is a problem but refuses to do anything about it.  So now I'm suing them in small claims court.  I hear the Apple legal team needs work.  LOL  I am very happy with AAPL products, but I am not happy with Apple's 'sculdugerous' sales and warranty practices.  I think I'll give the Calif State Attorney General some work by reporting this bait-and-switch  policy.     &amp;#x200B;  So when you're all drooling today over a wide angle lens and better night foto's - jsut remember that when your new phone fails, you will own a lesser device after AAPL does a warranty exchange.  In my experience, this has been the store policy and the (de facto) corporate policy."
"I‚Äôve noticed recently that when Siri looses connection during a query it says that it lost the connection and says it will try again, which it does."
Hi. So I‚Äôm watching tv in the living room and ƒ∞ have to go to the bedroom for something. What do ƒ∞ say to Siri on my bedroom HomePod to get her to play the living room Apple TV Audio here on the bedroom HomePod so ƒ∞ don‚Äôt miss out on the story?
Every time I see one I like I always ask Siri to ‚Äútell me where this picture is from‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat is this picture?‚Äù or similar.  She never understands.
"So I was wondering is it possible to set something up so that Siri can respond based on one entry a week as an example ‚Äúhey Siri, which bin collection is it this week?‚Äù"
I'm having a problem while enable siri.  [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55112090/cant-enable-siri-within-inuiaddvoiceshortcutviewcontroller-the-enable-siri-a) you can find what i am talking about. I tried every solution on internet for others siri problems but this link was the ONLY i found about this problem.  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry for bad english.
"Just needed to vent after reading yet another lousy ""Voice Assistant IQ test"". For the vast majority of my queries, Siri can do the job just as well as Google Assistant, and even sometimes better.  Why? Because I don't care about the King of \[*Country*\] in \[*Obscure Year*\], I care that you can quickly text with good transcription accuracy, manage my reminders + calendar, and manage the few smart gadgets I own.  And this might be anecdotal, but I feel like this is &gt;80% of use cases.  As an example: Google Assistant **still** can't handle the query ""Remind me to do X when I get to work."" Siri handles it just fine - as well as other location reminders. Google Assistant is just confused and keeps asking me ""what time?""  Another example: I trust that when I ask Siri about my schedule, I can get **both** work and personal appointments - not just one. Google Assistant infamously can't handle this - making a Nest Hub schedule view absolutely useless.  Lastly, Siri is also great about recognizing nicknames if you put them in your contacts - Google Assistant picked this up recently, but you have to navigate to a separate menu in the Assistant app, rather than just updating your contacts list.  Kudos to the Siri team for, I think, putting the focus on the right use cases, and not trying to fall for the blogger hype of satisfying every/all queries that a Google could do."
Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. I was having a conversation with my wife this morning about how I need to go get oil to change the motor oil in the car. Five minutes later I get in the car and open Apple maps. The first item on the list was o‚ÄôReilly auto parts. It disturbed me enough to shut as much of Siri as I can. It also got me thinking if anybody puts their phone in a RF protective sleeve. I‚Äôm looking into getting one.
Would anybody have any idea what is causing Siri on my iPhone X on iOS 12.4  volume to be so low but only when invoked with the side button? I‚Äôve checked all of the volumes and they are at 100% and when I use the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù  feature The volume is loud and clear.

"I have ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù , i known how to use it , but i wuold like to have a Siri icon to press ... It is possible ? I don‚Äôt want to use shortcut ... my iPhone is jailbroken and i would prefer a simple link ..."
"I'm setting up my relative's technology, really hoping Siri could help.  He needs to just say ""Hey Siri, Call Bob!"" - and it calls Bob.  He literally can't use his hands so well, I mean the iphone will be by his bedside, plugged into the charger, just waiting for him to speak. He can't press the home button, is what I mean. The phone screen will be black - not even the lock screen.  Any ideas? I bought him an Iphone 6. If that can't do it, can any?  Thanks! It will make a huge difference. Currently he places calls through Alexa with Skype - huge delay, can't really talk to people easily. Hope the Iphone can help."
Guys the 2038problem is wat???im really confused comment to me if you know anything
[Hey Siri](https://youtu.be/mrUX_ZUjrRY)
Out of all the news I read/click on..CNN is probably about 5%   Why on earth would Siri suggest a news source I rarely ever look at?
So I have AirPods and a Bluetooth fan transmitter in my car and when something is playing in my AirPods and get in the car it automatically connects and switches to my car radio. Is there a Siri command to get it to change the audio back to my AirPods?
"ƒ∞ often use ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù at home to turn lights on or off, play music and other such things. My HomePod is in the shop after it got wet, so the only thing in the room is my iPhone.  When it hears the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù it lights up and you can see the Siri wave form on the screen for a second and then it goes away as if another device has taken the request. But there are no other active devices around. My watch is switched off because it was in a startup loop and will cost too much to replace, my MacBook has hey Siri disabled and it‚Äôs lid is closed. There are two other iPhones in the apartment but not even close to within earshot.  ƒ∞ have only noticed this at home. It‚Äôs really bugging me. Anyone have any ideas?"
Barley found out about this little tidbit.  lol
"For capability, and understanding of my questions, Siri is actually so bad.   Apple were first to market, and I was impressed. But now it feels like it‚Äôs been forgotten. Abandoned.   Anyone think it can catch up to or overtake google assistant?"
Siri is worthless for me right now.  I even tried a full phone reset. No help.    It will either do a really good job or it will be a situation where I say a sentence or two and get maybe three words.  üò°
"I have an alexa and I can use my iphone using bluetooth to activate siri shortcuts and have it play music through my iphone but I have to be near my iphone to activate siri. Is there a bluetooth wireless mic I can use with siri that I can place in my living room so I can say ""Hey Siri"" and activate my iphone when it's not with me?"
"Siri always worked great at playing music hands-free in my car. But since I signed up for Apple Music, whenever I ask Siri to play an artist or song, it says ""it looks like you're not connected to cellular data"". I'm not; I don't have unlimited data, and I don't want Siri streaming songs to play. I just want her to play the songs already on my iPhone.  Here's the thing... if I ask her to play a playlist (ie. Hey Siri, play playlist ""Recently Added""), she plays the music.  Help?  Greg"
"I recently learned that if you ask Alexa a question, she can read the answer back to you. When I ask Siri, all she does is say something like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what I found‚Äù and pull up some links. My uncle recently had a stroke, so can‚Äôt really use his phone. However, he can use one hand. If he can somehow have Siri read back to him that would mean the world."
Like the title says Siri‚Äôs voice has changed overnight on my phone 3 times. Have no idea why. From British female to British male. Then when I open the setting to change it back it says its downloading the female voice. Anyone else having this issue?
"Hey everyone  When I play BBC Sounds with Siri on my iPhone SE and ask Siri to pause the radio, it pauses the radio briefly before turning it back on. What do I have to do to make sure the radio stays off using Siri? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Septic"
"‚ÄúHey Siri, I‚Äôm starting CPR‚Äù should at the very least start a beat at the proper CPR compression rate.  As a bonus it could call 911 and use beam forming microphones and/or noise cancelation to allow the user to communicate with dispatch while the beat is still playing."
"Hi, i‚Äôm trying to create short, when I connect to my car Bluetooth in morning it start maps directions to my office. And in the evening when I connect to my car Bluetooth it shows direction to my home."
"I looked up whether Hey Siri works on the iPhone XS online because I was under the impression that it did, although it never works when I try it, not even when the music is very low and gentle. Ours really frustrating but from what I found online it‚Äôs just nota feature on the iPhone X/XS. Very disappointing."
"I LOVE that Siri pulls contact info from the email signatures in my Mail app to guess who is calling/texting, but instead of having to wait for folks to call, one at a time, then saving their contact info, is there a way to just proactively save all that suggested contact info in my Contacts so that I can use it to call/text?"
I need siri shortcut to split video into 30 seconds parts for whatsapp status
I noticed a lot of apps have poor documentation when it comes to what you can say to Siri. Is there a way to find out what commands an app supports
"This really irritates me. Anytime I use Siri (unlocked) it throws the blocking screen back up to confirm what I just told it. A lot of times I‚Äôm using this to add stuff to a list as I look through a page (such as a recipe) so I can keep dictating stuff to Siri.  But nooooo, Siri is going to be ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù by doing a goddamned confirmation screen for every goddamned interaction. I never noticed it before, but the confirm screen is utterly useless when the verbal confirmation is there. Imagine a confirmation screen blocking an order form every time you entered a part of your address.  This should be a configurable option.  Or am I missing something and there‚Äôs a way to stop this?"
I‚Äôm running ios 13 beta 3 and still hasn‚Äôt felt that siri has gotten a better voice. I‚Äôm using the american female voice and when trying to replicate the same question showcased by apple at WWDC i still get the ios 12 voice. Is it working for anyone? Or is it still not activated yet?
"   Me and my colleagues from 1Home have been wondering for some time now, why most people see voice control only as a system you operate with the Echo Dot. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  This is why we have prepared this article (https://www.1home.io/de/blog/this-is-voice-control) that showcases functionality and recorded a video at one of our team buildings on island Hvar (Croatia).

"I remember a couple of years ago when Apple announced they were making Siri more proactive, one of the feature was that in a lot of stock apps, you could say ‚ÄúHey Siri remind me of this‚Äù and it would create a reminder based on notes or a Safari page you were looking at. I reminder this feature being broken.   In an effort to save money, I want to move away from Evernote and other productivity apps subscription costs. I just tried using Siri to remind of a note and it didn‚Äôt work ( ‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt remind you about the notes App‚Äù), after I tried it a couple of more times it finally worked.   This is very unreliable, why and is there a fix?"
"I‚Äôve had my iPhone 8 Plus for under a year now (I went with an 8 plus as an upgrade because I wanted a home button, maybe that‚Äôs weird but I needed a home button lol) so as of the past 2 days my battery life has basically just shit out. I‚Äôm watching my battery die as I type this bad. I haven‚Äôt changed anything about how I use my phone and it feels very sudden and strange as I know apple has gotten flack for this before. Could this be an IOS update issue? Is this just apple trying to get me to update? I‚Äôm really not tech savvy but I‚Äôve tried managing the issue in the battery tab but it says everything is working fine. It‚Äôs frustrating to say the least."

Does IOS 13 Siri Neural TTS only available for American accent ? I couldn't notice any difference for British voice.
"Yesterday, I was talking to some friends over dinner about James Spader. One of my friends says, ""The first time I remember seeing James Spader was in an 80s movie called Tuff Turf!"" And then we all laughed, because who the hell ever heard of a James Spader movie called Tuff Turf?  Today, I opened a new Amazon tab and searched for ""cal digit"". I'm considering buying a dock, and I misspelled Caldigit. I got a long list of results including Caldigit products and other USB-C hubs, docks, adapters etc.--all computer gear. Except halfway down the list was a link to rent motherfucking Tuff Turf on Prime Video.  MOTHERFUCKING TUFF TURF! How is that possible unless my phone is listening to me? HOW? By no stretch of the imagination does Tuff Turf have anything to do with ""cal digit"". I have never searched for anything related to Tuff Turf or James Spader. I didn't pull up his IMDB during the conversation or anything remotely like that. Unless somebody can offer a reasonable explanation, I'm turning off Siri and denying microphone access to all apps except the phone and camera.   Oh yeah--I don't have any Amazon apps installed. I don't have Facebook or any other social media apps, no free games, no ad-supported apps whatsoever. All the people at the table had iPhones. We were in a restaurant, so there were no Alexa or Google devices nearby. It makes no sense, and it's too specific to be a coincidence."
"I just upgraded to AirPods 2 and at first I thought summoning Siri via only the AirPods would be a gimmick and not work, but it turns out if I speak louder, in a continuous sentence and without too much external voice she works almost every time.   I also find I‚Äôm using Siri WAY more now. It‚Äôs so convenient asking her to play playlists or respond in various chat apps via dictation. I love leaving the iPhone in the pocket of some bag and not worry about what‚Äôs on the screen as Siri can be commanded to reply and respond to a ton of stuff.   Has that been your experience with AirPods 2 + Siri as well? Please do share! üòä"
"I dare you to! Trust me, you won‚Äôt regret itüòÅ"
"Hi! Just the other day when my mom was setting up a timer on Siri it started saying some pretty weird things. I‚Äôm from Sweden so the translations might be a bit off, but it started saying something by the likes of ‚ÄúShit, I don‚Äôt know how to do that‚Äù she then tried to set the timer again but Siri just returned with the word ‚Äúfuck‚Äù.  If anyone has any ideas on what might have caused it and how to fix it, that would be very appreciated. It came out of nowhere and we both got a bit shaken up."
"So I was messing around with the settings and I don‚Äôt know what I did but now I have to press the ‚Äòsiri‚Äô symbol? every time i want to say something new to siri. Sorry if its already been asked, I tried searching but I couldn‚Äôt find an answer."
"I try to use ‚Äòremind me when I get home‚Äô and the reminder is set, but Siri doesn‚Äôt seem to recognise that I am at my house when I‚Äôm at my address.  I live in a high rise in a busy neighbourhood, in Hong Kong. Maybe it gets confused?! So, as a workaround I‚Äôd want it to remind me when it connects to my home wifi. Would solve the issue. Does anyone know of it is possible?"
"When I say ""Dislike this song"" to Siri, it skips to the next song but doesn't mark the song as Disliked."
Is there a way to stop Siri from muting the volume playing on YouTube in Chrome when I ask Siri a question?
"European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese are not the same and there are a lot of differences speaking wise other than the accent. So why is there not eu Portuguese siri? I try and try and try to speak to her and she doesn't understand me so I just gave up and not I have to use it in English.  And also does anyone know how am I supposed to ask for assistance? Apple's website is sooo confusing, the support part, and even when I try to contact a person it still gives me no option for siri problems... I don't get it"
"Siri has her uses, but this one thing totally sucked:  ""Text David Arriving at nine fifteen AM""  iPhone text feedback shows the entire verbal message is received.  Siri replies, ‚ÄúOK, I‚Äôll send this‚Äù ‚ÄúArriving At‚Äù  It‚Äôs like she literally reads the message, thinks of a creative way to butcher it without looking like it‚Äôs 100% Siri‚Äôs fault, then offers to send garbage to said recipient.   This is not an isolated event. Simple messages turning into eclectic wastes of time occur once per day. In her defense, I send approximately 100 verbal Siri commands per day, she‚Äôs not TERRIBLE, but she has this niche weakness that makes me wish I called the person instead."
"Sorry if this has been answered but i searched and didn't find anything...  I like to use the spotlight (now called siri suggestions) search menu to see the eight suggested apps from siri. I use a relatively small number of apps and the Siri suggestions are useful to me. But when i type in the search field i don't want suggestions for web search, which i find useless yet it appears above the suggested apps.   So when i type ""red"" in the search field i only want to see the icon for my Reddit app but i don't want to see the five suggested web search terms for ""red sox,"" ""red lobster"" etc. above it. But when i turn that off the list of eight commonly used apps disappears too.   Seems like the only option to turn off web search suggestions is to also turn off app suggestions.   Anyone know a way to do this?"
My cousins is a quadriplegic with muscular dystrophy. He has been enjoying controlling his iPhone with Siri but Siri seems to have some difficulty doing certain things.  For example: I was able to sync my audible account to his phone and transfer a bunch of audio books to his phone successfully. But he can't seems to get Siri to open an audiobook consistently. Anyone know how to fix this?

"I often wind up walking around my house while listening to a podcast through my phone's speaker. When I activate siri, it will catch the last couple words of the podcast, which inevitably messes up whatever instruction I give it.  Is there anyway around this other than always pausing my podcast before activating siri? It seems ridiculous that this hasn't been solved by apple."
"I just switched from a note 9 to the XS. Every morning when I leave for work I would say ""Hey Google, Play the news"" and it would cycle through about 10 different news reels each about 3 or 4 minutes long. You could set which ones you wanted in this list. When I say ""Hey Siri, Play the news"", it responds with something like, ""Now playing CNBC News, if you'd like to switch to fox news or any other then say 'switch to fox news""  &amp;#x200B;  What I'm looking to do is just play continuously one after the other similar to how the Google version works. Is this something that needs to be done in the news app or maybe shortcuts?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks"
"[iPhone 7+, iOS 12.2]  When driving, I try to obey the hands-free law in Georgia.  I leave Waze open which keeps the phone unlocked.  Occasionally, I'll have the need to send a text message.    **In the good old days** (up until the 12.2 update I think) I could just say:  &gt; Me: ""Hey Siri, new text message to John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt mobile"" &gt;  &gt; Siri: ""Ok, what would you like to say to John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt?

"When I ask Siri to call some one on speaker phone, she will reply ‚ÄúCalling John Doe, mobile, on speaker.‚Äù And then call them not on speaker.

This bug has been there since the beginning and I have reported it, since the beginning, to apple but it‚Äôs still there. No big deal, but annoying and surprising.
 
 I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a language setting thing (would be interesting to know if it is there also for other languages).
 
 So, I noticed years back that when I make an appointment with Siri for, let‚Äôs say tomorrow at 08:30, I can see on the feedback text on my iPhone screen that the time is correct (08:30), but still Siri makes the appointment for 20:30. I have to say ‚Äú08:30 in the morning‚Äù, which is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but still annoying.  After all, the point with 24 hours setting is the difference between 08:30 and 20:30 and we are talking about Apple here, not a one-person-developer.
 
 There seems to be a turning point at 09:00. From 09:00 it works but before that, Siri books appointments in the evening.
 
 Just sent another bug feedback to apple. I‚Äôm sure they will thank me :)"
"So this has to be one of the most frustrating ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of the iPhone to me. I actively use the do not disturb while drive feature that is activated by movement speed as my car does not have Bluetooth.   I keep my phone plugged in to my car via a lightning cable that charges and outputs audio to my aux on the stereo.  However by saying ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù she won‚Äôt respond unless I hold the home button.   This seems to defeat the entire functionality of trying to keep the phone hands free. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating since I commute quite a bit for work.   On top of this, when Siri is activated she only talks to me over the phone speakers even though the aux is plugged in. I can‚Äôt seem to find any setting to change output device for Siri.   These two things seem to be pretty silly oversights.  Unless someone here can shed some light on my issues here."
"My geometry teacher just said thank you to siri and she replied with ""You're Welcome, Daddy"""
"I love having the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù function on my phone. I use it quite a bit when I‚Äôm driving for work to respond to messages or call people.   When I am in my office, I have to keep my cell phone nearby on my desk as some clients only contact me this way. However, while I never say ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù during the workday, my phone will sometimes think I‚Äôve said it. It happens frequently when I‚Äôm leaving a voicemail for anyone named ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried to speak clearly, but it hasn‚Äôt really helped.  So, as the title of my post states, I‚Äôm wondering if there is any way to have Siri auto-disable between certain hours of the day. YES I could manually do this every day, but if there is a way this could be done automatically that would be great. Doing it manually, everyday, seems like a tiny pain in the ass and I‚Äôm likely to forget.  Any suggestions appreciated! TIA!"
"Ever the optimist, I alway give Siri the benefit of the doubt. Today, I gave Siri what I thought was a softball:  Me: ""Hey, Siri, Directions to Max's Tavern""  Siri: ""Here's directions to Circle K""  Me: Hmm, maybe I spoke to fast.  Me, in my best TV announcer voice: ""Hey, Siri, Directions to Max's Tavern""  Siri: ""Which Circle K did you want?""  Me, screaming: ""How the FUCK does FUCKING ""Max's Tavern"" sound anything like ""Circle K!!!???""  At least Siri get ""Open Google App"" almost all the time."
"Hi all! I hope this is ok to post here. I just launched my first iOS app, [Just Timers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-timers/id1453573845?mt=8), which lets you create multiple timers and assign Siri Shortcut phrases to them for later use.   Just Timers is the missing timers app for iOS. Tired of only being able to set one timer? Hate not being able to name or reuse timers, let alone control them with your voice? With Just Timers you can not only have as many timers as you want at the same time, but you can also use Siri to control them! Assign Siri Shortcut phrases for various timers to make things easy to remember.   Some examples:  -	Create a reusable timer for green tea, then assign the phrase ‚Äútea timer‚Äù or ‚Äústart tea‚Äù. Use the trigger phrase to restart the timer any time you need it. -	Making tater tots for the kids? ‚ÄúTater tot timer‚Äù is fun and easy to remember! -	Need to take medication every few hours? ‚ÄúTook my meds‚Äù to restart the timer for the next duration. -	Create timers named by duration, then simply use a trigger phrase like ‚Äú20 minute timer‚Äù to summon it. -	Doing laundry? ‚ÄúStart the wash‚Äù will count down until it‚Äôs done.  If you love the Shortcuts app, not only will timers get donated to show up in the Shortcuts app, but I also have built-in support for x-callback-urls, so you can create your own shortcuts that interact with the app. I've documented the supported functions in detail [over here](https://justtimers.app/help/shortcuts/). I also created a Shortcut [available here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4fc4a164b2514f128793ffc35e85fac7) for creating new timers completely hands free (your phone does need to be unlocked or use Face ID to unlock due to iOS limitations).   I'd appreciate any feedback, thank you!  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-timers/id1453573845?mt=8"
I can't work out where these are coming from and why they keep  showing up. It is driving me nuts!
Is it just me or is Siri talking like 5% faster?
"Hi r/Siri, was hoping to find some help in figuring out how to stop Siri from adding a heart emoji to the beginning of my iMessages when sending my SO a text. I tried googling it but can't find anything regarding this, any ideas/insight into why this is happening? Looked in my Siri settings and Message settings but nothing seems to stick out. Thanks in advance for the help."
"I woke up and couldn't find my iPhone in my bedroom (turns out it was under a pillow) so I asked Siri on my HomePod where it was. Siri_HomePod replied, ""There are many iPhones signed into your iCloud account"" but that's not true - there's just one.  http://i.imgur.com/C1KTlO2.png  What's the best way to report this to Apple?"
"so i was on my mac and i wanted to view my downloads folder i had headphones plugged in when i holded a button on it it would activate siri so i held it and said ‚Äúshow me my downloads folder‚Äù it showed up as ‚Äúhi potter‚Äù i thought she is probably gonna say interesting question, Parker but she did not instead she said ‚Äúdid you accidentally summon me‚Äù i was creeped out thinking about what she said i was like can you even summon a device and if you can that is messed up, at this point i want to throw my mac in a bag and lock it and switch to a windows pc but i knew i could not i installed windows on it i got a win 10 license for it right now while writing this post on the blog i am creeped out. i googled this issue and more than 208 people have this issue i don‚Äôt know if the devs wanted to add a secret that became vary popular i hope this issue gets fixed i might need to disable siri i don‚Äôt want to tho i use it a-lot so disabling it also hogs system resources so i don‚Äôt need to disable this. i want to keep typing but i cant it is getting to long if you have had this issue comment down below"
"Hello Team, I hope that someone can help me out. Since last weekend my HomePod started acting up, not responding to personal requests or the shortcuts I have setup. I have restarted it, removed and re-added it to my ‚ÄûHome‚Äú as well as turned off Siri completely. Just now I broke down and removed all Shortcuts, creating a new one - just speaking some text, then I setup the phrase for the shortcut and tried it out. It worked exactly one time, then it stopped either just going dark after I hailed it using the phase or offering to play music.  What else can I do?"
I‚Äôm looking for a way to lock/unlock Ubuntu with a Siri shortcut using an ssh script. Does anyone know how to write this type of script?
"So when you ask Siri ( in French) about who is the Algerian President (which is Bouteflika), Siri says it‚Äôs Macron (the Current president of France)...  This is interesting because Algeria was colonized for 132 years by France and Algeria managed to get independence in 1962. Algerians tend to think there is some ‚Äúshady agreements‚Äù with France up to this day justified by the French involvement in many Algerian matters even after 60 years of independence. So what can be causing this error?   I have to mention that when using Siri in English, it gives the right answer (Bouteflika)."
"Everything began after updating to High Sierra, can't see temperature in Siri UI when asked. It is persisting even after updating to Mojave.

I just asked Siri if she was planning on killing me and she said YES! This was after she randomly came on and gave us the definition of parenticide. Like what the hell? Husband unplugged the Apple home pod. Anyone else have a weird Siri encounter?
"I was thinking why I hate to use Siri...  &amp;#x200B;  And I came to the conclusion that as a non-native English speaker I have to do the extra step ‚Äì the translation. It feels completely unnatural to switch language just to utter a simple question or command.  &amp;#x200B;  I quite understand that making Siri for all languages is an impossible task. However I believe there is a middle ground ‚Äì a simple automated translation from the native language to English is enough. I saw few bilingual children that were using same approach ‚Äì somebody asked them a question in one language and they responded in another. It works.  &amp;#x200B;  There is a Dictation support for my language, so transcribing my speech into text can be handled by the system. Siri can translate between some pairs of languages, but unfortunately not mine. However if it could, there are all ingredients in place to enable this kind of interaction.  &amp;#x200B;  What do you think? Would you use it?"
I want to make Siri play the previous track by saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rewind time‚Äù  Can someone help me out?
"I have a shortcut set up to give me the weather, read me the news through RSS feeds, give me current cryptocurrency and stock prices, then finally play a music playlist on shuffle.   The whole purpose for this app is for it to run after a double tap on my AirPod having everything spoken from Siri from the time I leave my house to the time I pull into work. The issue I‚Äôm having is when I try this, the shortcut will restart itself with the the weather and normally starts over around the RSS feeds. I‚Äôve already tried to cut some out and lower the quantity on them but no luck. The odd thing is it‚Äôll complete the whole way through if it‚Äôs opened in the app. Anyone else know a fix for this issue?"

She says the colour is ""40W Tungsten""   Tried telling Siri to change the lamp to this colour but that doesn't work.  Has anyone else figured this out yet? "
"I'm having the weirdest problem with Siri in my car that I can't, for the life of me, figure out... hoping someone out there knows of a solution!  When I am using Siri in my car ‚Äì¬†which is connected to my factory radio using a bluetooth car adapter that hooks into the radio's aux port ‚Äì it listens to my request and transcribes it but then it says ""Hmmm... I'm having trouble with the connection, please try again later"" after about 15 seconds or so. This happens every single time I use Siri over this bluetooth adapter... weird part is, it used to work pretty well until just a few weeks ago.  I know it's not a connection issue because it can stream my music and podcasts over LTE, no problem. I know it can hear me because it transcribes the words I speak. It's only connected to the bluetooth adapter and not to the car's bluetooth. And, it happens whether Do Not Disturb While Driving is enabled or not, or if the phone is unlocked or not.  Any ideas? Much appreciated if you can help, I'm totally stumped!"
I want to change my Siri‚Äôs voice to match the Half Life HEV Suit sounds but I don‚Äôt want to jailbreak my device. Any apps that can do this?
"One of my top uses for the Apple Watch while driving has been using it to queue up tracks without stopping the currently playing music. For example:  1. As an album is playing, ask Siri on the Watch to: ""play \*song\* next"" 2. Siri would respond, acknowledging the song has been added to the Up Next queue. 3. The requested song plays, then goes back to the album that was playing  &amp;#x200B;  It seems now however that the features is totally dead for the Watch. I spent almost an hour with Apple Support troubleshooting. Sadly I'm still just getting this type of response, no matter what I'm listening too:  &amp;#x200B;  [Play \*song\* next, failing on Apple Watch S4](https://i.redd.it/165srt9aukh21.png)  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img st1ko2anukh21...*  &amp;#x200B;  Does anyone know a workaround?

"I am looking for some help or a good resource for using Siri. I have tried to use Siri for Apple Music, but I can‚Äôt get it to do what I want. My experience even with simple tasks has left me frustrated with it. I have quite a few shortcuts, but run them all from the widget. It is simpler to me to do things that way.

"Everything else (Google search, iOS keyboard voice, ... ) all see my BT headset.  Everything except Siri.  Siri does output to the BT speakers on the headset, but doesn't see the mic on the same headset."
"I utilize Siri as much as I can and I‚Äôm well within the Apple ecosystem.   Lately Siri on the HomePod for home automation (lights, switches) does not respond, but using my iPhone will work.   Now the interesting part here is on my Apple TV it will control the lights, but then using Siri on my Apple Watch does not.   I thought Siri on the Apple Watch uses the phone so that one intrigues me the most. Interesting yet, Siri for anything else on the HomePod works fine.   I‚Äôve had an instance  where my lights (Philips) wouldn‚Äôt communicate, so I changed the channel. I‚Äôve cycled through all channels with no response via HomePod.    Any thoughts on what‚Äôs going on here or things to try?"
"It seems my siri is not working anymore, but constantly picks up sound when there is no noise, I thought it had something to do with my speaker but it takes calls it fine so I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôve tried turning it on and off and thought maybe it was a glitch of the last update so I updated it to the most recent iOS aswell, but still no luck, any ideas??"
"yo, i was just running up the fucking hill, right ? this bitch, ‚Äúsiri‚Äù, just decided to turn on. and i was like, okay cool, maybe she thought she heard someone call her or sum. but then, i remembered that i turned off the ‚Äúhey siri‚Äù setting (because i‚Äôm paranoid as hell), so i started to slow down. she then made that noise that signifies that the speaker turned off. but then she says, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you like me ?‚Äù or something along those lines. so, i ran inside my house and looked up if this ever happened to someone else. it didn‚Äôt come up with anything. i looked at a few articles, and decided to download reddit so i could tell some people about it.  this part may be a coincidence, but i‚Äôve never had this problem before: when i was using the fingerprint thing to download it, and it wouldn‚Äôt work. like, now you don‚Äôt wanna fuckin work ?? anyways, i‚Äôve seen a few reddit posts that have been explained by people in the thread, and i‚Äôm hoping someone explains this. i‚Äôm scared as fuck dude.

"I hope this is the right sub for this. When I tell Siri ""send text to [insert person's name]"", she will only reply ""what do you want to say to the group?"". It doesn't seem to matter which person I'm trying to send a text to.  I ended up texting 11 people that I was 10 minutes away last night while I was driving."
Anyone figured out a way to have Siri require a longer press of the lock button? It seems like half the time I go to unlock my iPhone XS Siri pops up for me and this definitely wasn‚Äôt a problem on my iPhone X.

"Hi,  &amp;#x200B;  I use it in Turkish and if I want to download an app that has an English name, it doesn't understand me correctly. Same for artists on Apple Music. How do you deal with that?  &amp;#x200B;  Thx."
"I was messing around with Siri this evening and sung line by line, bohemian rhapsody, only two lines yielded responses :  ‚ÄúIs this the real life?‚Äù ‚ÄúI see a little sillouhetto of a man‚Äù  Both of these lines returned the entire corresponding verse after this. "
"How do people feel about Siri‚Äôs suggesting that devices aren‚Äôt interested.    When I ask for a HomeKit scene to be run, Siri sometimes tells me some devices aren‚Äôt interested... and the others are?   Just curious if people generally like or dislike this. "
The A13 chip will allow for On-Device processing (according to leaks) and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. This would mean users benefit from faster Siri responses and many other things. I can‚Äôt wait!
If I take a photo of an appointment card can I ask Siri to get an appointment off of that card? If not I hope they add that feature.

Feature request: Multilingual Siri
What is odd about this is it only happens if my phone pics up the Hey Siri command. If I talk to my watch it seems to work fine. I‚Äôve checked the user setting and my wife is the only contact programmed as such. My Dad is tagged as Dad. My step mom is tagged as ‚Äúbonus mom‚Äù. I tried teaching Siri again and she seems to have them all correctly assigned tags. It started happening about 3 months the ago and won‚Äôt fix itself. Any insight? 
If you could unlock your phone while driving by telling Siri your passcode  If when you asked Siri for directions it would direct you to the closest match?    If you asked what the score of the  Giants game was while standing in San Francisco during baseball season while football season is out and she didn‚Äôt ask you which team you meant - San Francisco or New York?  If you were making a grocery list using reminded and you didn‚Äôt have to reference the list name at every item?  Ie - Add milk to the grocery list.  Eggs.  Bread.   If you could ask Siri to google something - and it opened safari and googled it.  Because let‚Äôs face it - bing sucks.   Siri could be so great but it seems like it‚Äôs now lagging behind - and in some cases going backwards.    I would love for Apple to bring it up to speed and make it what it should be.  I think everything else about Apple products are superior - but I‚Äôve had times where it‚Äôs easier to ask Siri to open google assistant than it is to use Siri.   Any other suggestions out there?

"I have an iPhone 6 still running iOS 10.3.3, because I hate updating, every time I ask to set an alarm, or countdown timer Siri replies, ""sorry something went wrong,"" and the alarm doesn't get set. It started last night. Siri still answers everything else I ask like opening apps and random questions. I toggled on and off Siri and Enable Dictation. I logged out and back into iCloud on the phone. I've rebooted the phone. Apple services on the web say they're up and running.   I still have have an iPhone 4s on iOS 6 that I use as my alarm clock that I place on top of an old iHome radio. When I ask to set an alarm, that older Siri replies with a similar response but the alarm gets set.   Is this an iOS issue? Is there anyone else out there using an old version of iOS and can't set alarms? Is Apple slowly turning off features to force you to upgrade?    Any help/advice is appreciated! "

"Yesterday I was using my various shortcuts: Office, Home, etc.  They all worked fine.  Today upon saying `Office` or `Run Office` Siri just shows the definition of Office.

"I have been an Apple Music subscriber for about a year now, but lately when I tell Siri ""don't play this song/band anymore"" she replies ""Sorry, you must have an Apple music subscription"".

"I use dictation a lot. I have carpal tunnel so it‚Äôs easier on my hands, plus I‚Äôm a delivery driver and it is so much better for hands-free. When she‚Äôs good she‚Äôs amazing but more often than not, for lack of a better phrase, she‚Äôs second guessing what she thinks she hears and she gets it wrong. I will look at the text as she is putting it on the screen, I‚Äôll see the correct phrase but when I finish dictation it‚Äôs been changed to something completely unrelated.  I‚Äôll tap on the little line underneath the the incorrect word and the correct word or phrase exactly the way I said it is there.  I don‚Äôt have an accent and I speak clearly.  Is there any word on whether they are actually going to start processing dictation on board instead of uploading/downloading? There is certainly enough power in the phone to manage it. It just strikes me that Siri is really about the same as she was five years ago, there‚Äôs been no improvement that I can see beyond a more natural voice. I can correct the spelling of my name a thousand times and she‚Äôll still spell it wrong when I dictate it every single time.    Anyway I guess this is as much a rant as anything else, it‚Äôs been getting increasingly frustrating because it should be better than it is."

This isn‚Äôt a question of siri listening in, it‚Äôs a question of my camera on both my phone and computer, observing the manicure I had been working on in segments throughout the day. I‚Äôm a very skeptical person when it comes to stuff like this, I mean even if they were listening/watching, why would they care abt me? But this time I‚Äôm actually freaked out because I‚Äôm certain the only way to know I was working on my nails would be through observation.  Is this a possibility? If so, how does it work? What are they looking for? Is it just to sell me more stuff? Don‚Äôt they know I‚Äôm broke??"

I can say ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù and I will see those words pop up but then it goes right back to the lock screen. It does not follow my commands at all.

"When I go into my setting to turn Siri on, each time I press ‚Äúenable Siri‚Äù the pop up will show asking again if I want to enable Siri and when I press ‚Äúenable Siri‚Äù again, it will just close the pop up and immediately show back up. I am on IOS 12 with an iPhone XS."
"I have this problem where by random when I‚Äôm watching a video, it‚Äôll randomly pause or fast forward. I‚Äôve done some research related to this problem and the results would be that the headphones are broken. What I did was that I bought a brand new set of headphones (same brand and model as my older headphones.) Despite that I purchased a new pair, I still keep getting the same pause and fast forward bugs that I‚Äôve encountered when I would wear the older headphones.  So, here‚Äôs the twist; for any smartphone, there‚Äôs the usual ringer mode where the audio is coming out of the phone, then there‚Äôs the regular headphone mode, right? But for me, I‚Äôve noticed that I have TWO headphone modes, one where I‚Äôm able to watch or listen without any discrepancies, and the other being that of the random pause and fast forwards.  I don‚Äôt know if this is an internal problem with my phone or if there‚Äôs an option to disable it.  I need answers."
"iphone asks to be unlocked before I am allowed to make a new voice note, even though the app has permissions through locked screen. what gives?"
"Ok but first you‚Äôll need to unlock your phone.  My phone used to launch the app once unlocking. Now I say Siri .blah blah , I unlock then have to select the app to launch. Is there a fix?"
"Is there any way to request Siri to run a specific named shortcut within the shortcuts app?   I tried ‚Äúhey Siri, run dictate to bear‚Äù - doesn‚Äôt work. Also ‚Äúrun dictate to bear in the shortcuts app‚Äù.  Surely there is a way to ask this?"
"Hi Guys!  After buying a new iPhone XS and update my iPad pro to iOS 12 i found that Siri stopped working with some of my usual commands for Apple Music. Example: ‚ÄùHey siri play the best music from the 80s‚Äù after 15 seconds she say ‚ÄúI coulden‚Äôt find any music from that decade‚Äù.   If i try this on my Mac works great    Anyone can help me with this?  Ps sorry for my bad english, i‚Äôm italian "
"does anyone else here get bothered at the fact that some icons at the help screen don't show up as icons based on the categories? Such as Translation Sports Restaurants and Stocks, those icons are only showing as Siri icons, Im wondering if they will ever fix that"
"Hi, its possible create a shortcut that tell me the next game whit date, hour, opponent, location, of any soccer team I want? Thanks "
"In all articels I read, people say, that it‚Äôs not possible to set multiple timers, but I recently figured out how it works for me. I simply have to give the timer a name like ‚ÄúHey Siri, set a rice timer for 15 minutes‚Äù.  So did I discover something new, or were all the articles outdated?"
"I have been using the iTunes Remote app on my X to control the music in my iTunes library but sometimes I just wanna have Siri do it for me. Would it be possible to:  A) Use Siri to play songs from my library on my PC   B) Be able to search through Apple Music with Siri vs just the songs I have saved in my library (unfortunately, Remote doesn't support AM I believe)  Thanks!"
Works fine if I say call. Anyone else experiencing this? Only happened since I‚Äôve upgraded to new iPhone 
"I‚Äôve noticed whenever I ask her to play songs now, she‚Äôll think about my request for at least 10-15 seconds before respond that she can‚Äôt so that right now. Then, if I ask again directly afterwards she‚Äôll respond with what I asked for almost immediately. "
"I often don‚Äôt have my phone near me and want to check if I have new messages and what not without touching the phone itself and the only way seems to be to say ‚ÄúHey Siri, nevermind‚Äù and she shows me the lock screen. Any other attempt forces an unlock. I don‚Äôt want to read the notifications, just find out IF there are any. Ideas?"
Hey everyone. If you have any specific questions regarding how to set up or sharing a Shortcut head over to r/shortcuts and share it over there. That way we can keep this sub focused on Siri features rather than the Shortcuts app. Thanks!
"So far, I‚Äôm finding shortcuts to be just useful enough to be frustrating. For instance: I want to set up a shortcut that turns off all but my dining room light, and plays music on my Apple TV. Is there a way anyone knows of to do this? Also, is there a way to add an action that issues typed commands to Siri within a given shortcut? "
"Hello, when I try to use Siri, dictation or when I try to create a shortcut, it‚Äôs like Siri doesn‚Äôt hear me. Can anyone help?"
So I‚Äôm trying to modify the ‚ÄúETA‚Äù shortcut to basically use my and my wife‚Äôs location to do as the title states. Possible?

"I saw the ""Heading to work"" shortcut and thought it would work great.  I adjusted for 8am, and thought it'd work great.  To my dismay, I can't seem to find a way to get the Podcasts app to work with it?  I just want it to resume the podcast I was listening to, or play the next, but even the ""Open App-&gt;Podcasts"" didn't work on Carplay.  Has anyone tweaked this to work?  And a much simpler question, when I grant the Shortcut app a permission, I'm not granting it to an app or dev right?  As in if there's a Messages one to text my location, Messages doesn't get it when I hit ""allow"" right?  Just the Shortcut app itself?"
"Hey,  as it seems the new ""search device"" feature in Siri is trying to look for my old iPad even though it's not even listed in my iCloud account anymore.  It's looking for ""iPad von Normen"" instead of ""Normens iPad"" as my current iPad is called. That was the name of my second iPad I think.  I don't see a way to change this, the ""look for my phone"" app lists my iPad as normal."
"So in my initial playing with Shortcuts and setting these up, i've noticed the custom ""siri phrase"" does not appear to sync across devices. The shortcut workflow itself syncs, but not the custom siri phrase.   &amp;#x200B;  Anyone else noticed this/has a solution?"

"Is it just me or is Siri slower than usual when asked to play something from Apple Music? I'm currently on iOS 12 GM and when I ask her to play something that is downloaded to my phone, even with good service and signal she will either take way longer than usual (5-6 seconds vs. 1-2) or she will time out completely and say the cellular service isn't strong enough.  Please tell me I'm not the only one. .."
"Quite often when I‚Äôm driving, I‚Äôm using Siri to read and send texts.  Also, I‚Äôm using Waze for navigation.  Mid listening to incoming text, Waze is permitted to talk at the same time as Siri, making it all useless. Have to ask Siri to repeat etc. doesn‚Äôt this drive others crazy too?  Ideally Waze would be permitted to interrupt, pausing Siri, and when it completed, Siri would then continue.  I searched for this complaint elsewhere to no avail... maybe it‚Äôs just me "
"I've been using Siri more lately, and it seems to have a problem with adding songs to playlists. When I try to have Siri add a song to one of my playlists, for many playlists but not all, Siri will just respond with ""I'm sorry &lt;name&gt;, but the playlist &lt;PL name&gt; isn't editable"". I can manually add songs to these playlists, both on my iPhone &amp; iTunes on my Mac, but Siri refuses. And as far as I can tell, there's no differences between the playlists Siri can and can't add songs to. Anyone else ever run into this?"
"Not sure if anyone else is experiencing this behaviour but since I updated to ios 12 siri doesn't recognize the fact that my contacts have multiple numbers. Previously, I would say 'Siri, call Steve' and she would reply 'Which number?' Now she just takes the first number and dials it. If I specifically ask to 'Call Steve, on mobile', she says there isn't a number but I am looking at it in the contacts app. I use my Google contacts list and it was working fine before the upgrade. Not sure if there is a new setting in ios 12 that I am missing or something."
The past few days Siri has sounded depressed.  Before that she sounded chipper.  It‚Äôs like she is tired or something.  
"Many times when I call Siri, she will work. But it's starting to be about half the time now, she doesn't. This happens if I hold the button to initiate (and then let off once the screen starts to darken), say Hey Siri to the phone, or double tap my airpods. If there's music, it'll pause, the screen will go dark waiting for Siri for a few seconds. But then there will be the""Okay talk"" beep followed right after ""Stop Talking"" beep. It'll often do this multiple times in a row. Is there some sort of setting I might have triggered that she isn't giving me time to speak?"
"I'm Japanese, and Siri can't catch my words like 'thirsty', 'water' and 'manuals'. They appear as 'sasuke', 'what are' and 'Manuel' on the screen. Does Siri catch native speakers' words 100 % correct?"
"![video](4o3jr69hm4d11 ""Heya, in action"")  Hello,  We'd like to share a better solution to a scenario that we assume a lot of users in this subreddit might do daily: i.e., send text using speech-to-text (Siri dictation).  I've been working in the speech recognition industry for 4 years, and even though the accuracy seemed to be improving overall (maybe with the exception of.. well.. Siri...), the interface around actually using speech-to-text still seemed to be lacking in various aspects, especially in the context of communication (e.g. sending text).  Saying ""Hey Siri, send a message to xxx"" is cumbersome to do for each message. Contact names are difficult so if often gets it wrong. Trying to tap on the small microphone button on-the-go is inconvenient. Dealing with recognition errors is very difficult to correct that a lot of the times users end up thinking they'd just use the keyboard from the get-go.  Our solution ([an iOS app](https://apple.co/2uVGafB)), tries to solve this problem by:  * Making it easy to even start speech-to-text without error: No tapping small buttons. Every action is gesture based, and you can start by tapping anywhere on the chat screen to initiate sending a message. This should be helpful on-the-go avoiding the need to tap on the mic icon, and then also tap the send icon when finished. Also, the action of opening up the app and tapping anywhere on your phone is equivalent to the action of saying ""Hey Siri, send a message to xxx"", which should be helpful for those who have hard contact names, or just don't want to say the command for each of the 5 messages you're sending. * Correct errors as you would do with a human: Just say it again. The interface makes it easy to cancel and just try again.      Take a look at the demo video. * Longer sentences are easier to compose: A lot of users use speech-to-text for longer messages, and we've made it easier to stitch and edit multiple lines. Again, take a look at the demo video to get a sense.   * Works with iMessage: I know.. a lot of you folks are thinking another text message app is the last thing I need. You can use this with iMessage though, as we have an iMessage extension. However, the extension doesn't have the full screen interface, as it's limited within the iOS development environment for iMessage extensions.  We're still in our early stages, and we don't dare say we've cracked the solution using speech-to-text for communication, but we do believe it's definitely a vast improvement. We'd love feedback from Siri lovers? (haters?) to see if this is something that would be useful for all.  Thanks!"

"I mean, shortcuts it‚Äôs like brand new oxygen for Siri nowadays, but still, i was expecting A LOT MORE about Siri with iOS 12.   I mean, she was one of the first (if not the first one) revolutionary AI helper, but when i hold my home button, i feel like getting back to iOS 6.  I can‚Äôt imagine the experience while driving, while you‚Äôre truly busy and she just understands a completely different thing (If Hey Siri worked this time)  For example, i noticed that a friend of mine has Google Assistant* and I realized that it can do the most stupid thing: TALK TO YOU. You can‚Äôt talk to Siri at the moment, if you say to Siri ‚ÄúHey Siri, Good morning!‚Äù She‚Äôll just answer ‚ÄúGood morning, Daniel! Google Assistant for example, will give you the chance to ANSWER BACK. Example: ‚ÄúGood morning, Daniel, how‚Äôs your day going?‚Äù or something like that. Of course it‚Äôs not a key feature, but it can actually entertain yourself, instead of doing ‚Äú0101‚Äù tasks. It feels like he‚Äôs just light years ahead now. And what about the must-full screen thing?  Did you expected something different from Siri this year? I honestly expected a whole brand new Siri.   *No flame or no Android vs iOS war intended."
"I was just reading the news how certain Sonos speakers will support Siri and Airplay 2 but I've read conflicting messages on how it supports Siri.  Can I use a Sonos speaker the same way I use a Homepod?

Anyone have an idea or can point me to something that explains how it works.  I've looked but am still confused."

I get the answer from Siri almost every time I try to play an audiobook in iBooks via EarPods while my iPhone 5S is locked. That‚Äôs probably is not right.   I use the following command to play an audiobook: ‚ÄúHey Siri play &lt;title&gt;  by &lt;author&gt; in audiobooks.   The command works only if the iPhone was unlocked recently and the iBooks app got in the foreground.   All this really frustrates me

"So I was just messing around with Siri before bedtime one night. I was texting my girl at the same time and she told me to ask Siri if I should marry her. I asked Siri and the answer I got gave me nothing but chills.   Here‚Äôs our conversation;   Me: Should I marry this girl?  Siri: You want to call the one who killed you?  I got chills all over my body and laughed nervously as I replied; NO!  Siri continued: Calling killed me Me: No! Stop! stop!  I can see her searching for this person on my phone before she comes back to me. And I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôd actually find someone by that name. Luckily she didn‚Äôt.  Siri: Couldn‚Äôt find anyone with that name in your contacts. Me: I sure as h**l hope you wouldn‚Äôt! WTH!?  Siri: Do you want to do a google search for who killed you?  By this time I was so freaked out that I just turned off my phone.   Now my native tongue is not English and Siri is also set to my language, but what I said sounds nothing like what she answered to. And besides what I said was clearly written on the screen. I was so surprised that I didn‚Äôt even think about taking screenshots, I just wanted to get my phone as far away from me as possible.   Has anyone else experienced something similar? Is it true that Siri does a creepy hour?"
"So last year Siri‚Äôs voice changed: it was peppier and seemed younger.  She always said, ‚Äúokay...‚Äù and sounded more human.  I just realized today, however, that she sounds like her old computery self again... Have they reverted back to the old voice?  Is it just my phone? Or am I just being ridiculous?"
Would ‚ÄòPretty Please‚Äô and ‚Äòcontinued conversations‚Äô work well wth Siri... once Apple works out the kinks in speech to text?

I have given up on using Siri to open up navigation for me. This is really the only thing I‚Äôm missing since switching from Android.

Hello All. If you have a spare few minutes a  University friend is looking for people to complete a very quick survey on our beloved digital assistants.

"I accidentally triggered Siri through my touch bar and the told him to ""Go away"". Like Alexa, he closed himself, but not before telling me ""Goodbye would be more polite""  I got schooled"
"My wife and I upgraded to the iPhone X a few weeks ago, and for the most part, the experience has been amazing. The gestures, the screen contrast and size, and more are just wonderful.  But Siri on her phone? It can be activated, but it doesn't hear us speak -- it doesn't hear anything, judging by the flatlined indicator at screen's bottom.  It worked briefly after a few days of having the phone (and the bug) long enough for her to train Siri to her voice, but after a day or so, it went back to not listening. We've done many of the steps shared online -- disable/enable Hey Siri, disable/enable dictation, reset network settings, etc. -- but nothing seems to reliably work.  In every other facet -- voice messages, voice memos, telophony, etc. -- her microphone works fine.   Why is Siri unable to use it properly?"
Any other close-enough words that work reliably?
"Funny how Siri can be great and horrible depending on the device/platform I use it on.      It's great in the car and kind of always has been.  The dictation isn't exactly perfect, but it's gotten to the point where I pretty much talk normal and it gets it 90-100% right.   If there's something that it missed, it's usually small enough that I can leave it. Sometimes I just follow it up with a text letting the other person know I'm using dictation so they don't think I'm having a stroke.      But it's really gotten way better anyway, so the mistakes look like mistakes any one would make with just a weird autocorrect or something.  It is a little weird that it sometimes uses the wrong ""to/too"" or ""there/their"" but then again, everyone on Reddit does that too lol        I just recently got CarPlay, but before that, I would use the ""Switch to"" command a lot. Like I'd be in music, and then switch to messages to read/respond and then switch back.  Or switch to Mail to see what just came in.      On the phone, I've pretty much learned what to expect of it, so I don't generally ask too much of it.  Sometimes, it surprises me like when I asked what the nominees for best picture were a few days before the Oscars and it knew.   I guess they know people will ask that and they make sure it knows, vs. trying to think of general questions where it has to resort to Bing results.       I don't use it on iPad or Mac as often, but again when I do, I usually only ask questions that I know it's going to know the answer to, and it does well enough with that.       The thing with HomePod is...     Say in the car I ask it to play a song, and it plays the wrong song.  It just becomes one of those ""Oh Siri...you idiot"" moments, and I have the controls right in front of me and I find the song.  But with HomePod, Siri is the preferred control, so it gets frustrating.  Same for when you want to control the in-progress audio and it doesn't understand you.     You can control it from iPhone, even if you're not AirPlaying, but it takes a few steps, and sometimes takes a few seconds (like 20-30 seconds sometimes) to load in what's happening on the HomePod before it lets you do anything.      I was seriously considering returning it more than once, but I found a happy medium with just using the Apple TV as an interface for it. So I use the AppleTV remote to play/pause/skip and for volume.  Plus the ""details"" section on the AppleTV Remote app on iOS lets you do the upcoming song list and move the order around and stuff which is nice.     I like Siri, but I feel like it just wasn't ready to be the primary way to control anything yet. Even something as simple as a music player.   I'm not asking it Google Home or Alexa stuff (trivia questions, turn the AC down, turn the lights on, etc.) just very simple tasks, related only to music, and it's very hit or miss.       On a kind of side note, I've always thought it was weird (bad) that they program these inside jokes in it, but don't make it say it right. For example, the old ""What does a fox say"" joke where it does the line from the song.  It just rushes through it and you can't even tell what's going on.  Like, if they're going to go through the trouble of putting a joke/punchline in there, why not make it say it like the song ?  That's not the only example but that's a pretty extreme version of what I'm talking about.  She puts the wrong emPHAsis on the wrong sylLAble. "

"Is it possible to get Siri to navigate to a specific business at an address (e.g. ‚ÄúTake me to the McDonald‚Äôs on Main St‚Äù)? It seems like when there are multiple instances of a business Siri will only try to navigate to the closest one instead of looking for the one at the address you gave.  If you are farther than 5 miles away, I‚Äôve found that the business you‚Äôre looking for doesn‚Äôt even show up in Siri‚Äôs results.  I‚Äôm coming from Android and Google Maps where this is a non-issue.  Thanks"

"At home I was playing around and changed macOS Siri to Russian. Had a little fun playing with that, it works decently on the limited repertoire of questions. I then went on a drive and when I was heading home, asked my iPhone the usual things (in English): start a podcast, give me directions to X; and it wasn't responding at all even if I shouted it loudly. Frustrating when you're driving. When I arrived I manually started Siri and noticed the Russian prompt popped up. I guess somehow it synced my language choice from my computer?  Unexpected, and less-then-ideal behavior."
"Hello everyone !  I speak French, but I use Siri mostly for playing songs, it's easier to use it in English so it can understand which song I want to listen to.   Even trough I still can ask for the weather or the nearest McDonald, it can't ask for places with a French names, or dictate messages for my French friends directly to Siri without changing the language in the setting menu.   Is there a way to get Siri to understand two languages simultaneously or will I have to sacrifice the messages captation for the music browsing ? "
"Hello,  I really like the hands-free ""Hey Siri"" feature of iOS and use it daily. My world would be enhanced greatly however if Siri could read me the search results she pulls up whenever you ask her basically anything and she turns to Google ""Here's what I found on the web, have a look...""  For example, tonight I asked her ""Hey Siri, how long do dishes need to soak in bleach water to be safely sanitized?"" as I already had bleach and water all over my hands and couldn't pick up my iPhone on the other side of the room.  Siri did her usual ""here's what I found..."" thing and did pull up a few web search result snippits/summaries that showed on the screen ""two minutes"". But when I tried ""Hey Siri, speak screen"" she just responds ""There's nothing to read."" even though the screen is full of text, that she herself just pulled up... üòë  I have all Speech/Accessibility features turned on. Is this just not possible? Are there any third-party apps that can help with this? What the hell do blind people do when she says ""have a look!""? I know that overall the iPhone is designed to work for/is well regarded as far as smart phones go for the adaptability/features designed for persons with hearing and/or vision impairment.   Thanks!"
"It‚Äôs a really frustrating problem, and I can‚Äôt find answers online. I use the reminders feature a lot. Often (about 30% of the time) I say something like: ‚ÄúHey Siri, remind me at 6pm to take out the trash.‚Äù She‚Äôll then respond ‚ÄúOk, I updated the reminder,‚Äù and will update an unrelated reminder (a reminder to buy milk at 9am) to be 6pm.   What am I doing wrong? Any advice would be appreciated. "

"My wife is disabled and using a speakerphone is really helpful to her.  My father just bought her a Google Home Mini and it's nice, but the best feature is being able to say ""Ok Google, call Bobby_Newmark"" and it dials me up.  *But*, the sound quality is terrible.  I'd love to set up a speakerphone that utilizes ""Hey Siri"" instead.  Obviously, Hey Siri is always on.  But you have to talk to it through the phone and then it'll switch to using the Bluetooth speaker/microphones.  Is there a way to have an ""always on"" speaker/microphone setup that will let her yell out ""Hey Siri"" wherever she is, without having the phone on her?    Obviously the phone would have to be within Bluetooth range of the speaker.  I went to the Apple Store to talk to them about it.  They tried it with some Beats speakers they had, but they couldn't get it to work.  The problem with those speakers is that they only turn on their microphones when the iPhone says to.  It doesn't work the other way around."
Does Siri use location for reminder? For example if I ask Siri to remind to to look up ‚Äúhow to cook beef jerky‚Äù when I arrive home (assuming I can set a home location)

"When I open Safari and I type in ‚ÄúSpan‚Äù, as if I‚Äôm about to navigate to spanishdict.com, Siri recommends me to Spankbang, a porn website. This is dangerous for children trying to learn Spanish. "
Can it only be done with screen recording?
"I put off using Siri forever but decided I‚Äôll enable her for efficiency while driving. But every time I say ‚Äúhey sir‚Äù, it just brings me to the ‚Äúsome things you can ask me‚Äù menu. I have no idea what to do. Can‚Äôt ask her or tell her anything. Anybody have any advice?  Edit: the on-mic noise is _immediately_ followed by the off-mic noise, I‚Äôm not sure why that happens every time I say ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù either. "
"Hey I got a quick question I couldn't answer browsing around.  I have a car with apple carplay. If I ask Siri ""hey Siri play my linkin park songs"" will she play the song I downloaded or try to go on Apple Music? I am wondering because of mobile data usage.  Thanks for your help "
"Basically anything other than hey Siri.    She calls me by the name I want, I wanted to see if it would go the other way....?"
"Hi,  I'm using iPhone and iPad. The Apple Music is enabled on both devices with the same settings and iOS versions.  However, I can only ask Siri to add song to a playlist with iPhone. This sound very weird."
Is offline Siri for iPhone 7
"When I do ""hey siri"" I cant finish a damn thing that I""m saying. If I want the damn bitch to process everything I say, i have to hold the home button down until I'm done. Kinda defeats the purpose of ""hey siri"" "
"When iOS 11 cam out, I was very impressed with the new younger, more natural-sounding Siri. This weekend, however, Siri went back to the old-lady robot-sounding Siri. Does anybody know what has happened?"
"It‚Äôs super loud, like rattle the windows loud. Then siri comes through the phone speaker just fine rather than my airplay sound system. Any fix for this??"
"I am trying to decide today between an 8 Plus and a Pixel 2 XL. Google Assistant can open a specified audio book in the Audible app and start reading. Can Siri? This is something I will want to do a lot of my wireless headset. I can only test on an iPad 4 right now, which doesn't doesn't support the newest OS. There, Siri is kinda crap and can only open the Audible app, which would force me to pull out the phone (making Siri kinda pointless). Does the newer OS improve Siri to support that?   I am also curious how people like iPhone transcription compared to google's voice keyboard (which I use a lot).  This definitely could be the deciding factor. "
"My title is supposed to say, SIRI not rival lol.   So one night at around 1:00am or so...I was trying to sleep and couldn't. I lived with my roommate at the time in this older apartment that was a bit creepy. So, I turned on Netflix on my phone to watch a movie to put me to sleep. While I began to doze off I hear Siri turn on...and it was listening to me and started spelling out what I was saying. Well I WASNT SAYING ANYTHING. It thought I had asked: who is Ezekiel and something with God in it (which I didn't say one word) It then responded something about Ezekiel and I freaked out and hit the home button and screamed. Has anything like this ever happened to anyone? Can anyone explain??"
"Lately I‚Äôve been wearing AirPods a fair bit and a thought struck me. I love having Siri always ready to listen with a tap on my ear, however she only ever responds. She has no autonomy. How about if we had a toggle option for ‚Äúactive Siri‚Äù that would let her chime in when needed (pausing your music if necessary), and telling you ‚ÄúYou have a reminder due, ‚ÄòPick up Jessica‚Äô‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew message arrived from Mum, would you like to hear it?‚Äù, ‚ÄúTime to stand!‚Äù, ‚ÄúYour next appointment is in 10 minutes, ‚ÄòMeeting with Ryan‚Äô‚Äù .... obviously many people wouldn‚Äôt want it, but for me, it would introduce a very useful aspect to Siri. At the moment the watch gives me a tap and lets me know when any of these things happen, which is fine ‚Äî but if I have the AirPods active then I would prefer Siri to verbally let me know. Maybe she could sample the AirPod microphones for a few seconds beforehand, just to make sure you‚Äôre not in the middle of a conversation. If she hears that you are speaking then she defers for a minute and tries again, and so on.  Any thoughts on this idea? "
How to configure iOS to only use offline/on-device features of Siri in iOS 11 ?
Whenever I do it always comes up as some place called ‚ÄòPhalia‚Äô? It only works if I do it in a really shitty American accent.
"Hey All,  New here! I am trying to put together an online magazine / blog on voice. Would love feedback on the idea and the first few posts. "
"I was out this morning having coffee with my wife and kids when somebody with a beautiful blue nose pit bull walked by. I asked my wife if she knew if they shed much. My phone was sitting on the table as we continued our conversation and about 5-10 minutes later I opened Safari to search for information about pit bulls shedding.  I have never searched anything related to pit bulls nor have I recently been researching anything dog related. After typing ‚Äúdo p‚Äù, there was a ‚ÄúSiri Suggested‚Äù result answering my exact question. ‚ÄúDo p‚Äù is nowhere near enough context for my phone to determine what I may be looking for.  So this leads me to wonder and ask, is Siri always listening to my conversations now and saving/storing that information for later use? I read through the Siri Terms and conditions and there is no mention of this.  Anyone else have a similar experience? Any suggestions on how to test this?  [Siri suggested search result](https://imgur.com/a/LKm3B)  "
Posted [my list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Siri/comments/71u37p/how_would_you_improve_siri_and_what_new_features/) last week and curious what other folks would like to see added (or improved) about Siri. What additional features and capabilities would like to see Apple add to Siri?
"I see a little silhouetto a man  Call Ghostbusters  What's your favourite animal?  Do you have a boyfriend?  Will you marry me?  When is the world going to end?  Is Jon Snow dead?  Read me a poem  What came first, the chicken or the egg?  Why did the chicken cross the road?  Where did I put my keys?  How old are you  Do you have any pets  What is your favourite colour  What are your best chat up lines  Why do you vibrate  Are you naked  I'm naked  Talk dirty to me  I'm drunk  What are you doing  What are you doing later?  Tell me about Liam  Will you go on a date with me  Can you kiss me  Can I kiss you  I love you Siri  How do I look  Beam me up  I am your father  Do I look fat in this  Do you like my new haircut     "
"**Context:** UX designer here, looking for design jobs and hoping to get a job at Apple. In the hopes of inspiring Apple to improve Siri and being noticed by Apple, and inspired by their open ""Siri Designer"" job listings, I've been brainstorming improvements and new ""features"" for Siri to mock up.

" I was watching a movie and a scene came up where someone asked Siri a question, for which some web pages were presented on their iphone. They then said ""Read aloud"" and Siri proceeded to read the search results.   How do you get your iphone to do that. That didn't work when I tried it.   By the way, I know how to activate the ""Speech"" option in Accessibility. But to get the iphone to do this you have to swipe with two fingers on the screen. I want this to work with a verbal command.   Also, this is for when you already open a link in Safari, and then want the web page read aloud to you.   That's not really the case I'm interested in. What I want is when Siri presents you some results on screen for what you asked for, if you then say ""Read aloud"", or something similar, it will read what's on screen."
"I wonder if the rocks  new Siri commercial where he's like: ""I hope I don't cause an eclipse ""  Has anything to do with the upcoming eclipse???   #I'm just high"
"Siri doesn't understand Tenafly, as in Tenafly, NJ. Siri thinks I'm asking for TEN A FLY. Any way to get around this?"
"What features/integrations/etc/, would you like to see most with Siri?  For example interface improvements{text input, better AI}, integrations with third party apps{spotify, google calendar, podcasts, social media}.  Or anything else you can think of !"
"So she can answer my questions? for example i asked her for my storage space and she couldn't answer that, and i know she can.   I just bought my first iphone and i'm acting like a kid now because siri's so fun but i want her to answer more questions"
(Technically this afternoon I guess)
Couldn't get to my phone quick enough to get a screen shot.
"How do you get a decent weather forecast spoken?  Ask ""hey siri, what's the forecast?"" or ""hey siri, what's the weather?"" and all that is spoken is the temperature range. How to get more spoken in a short, simple question?"
Curious cause I got a new iPhone and set Siri's voice to British 'cause it makes me right ^f^a^n^c^y but it almost seems as if Siri doesn't understand me quite as well.  
"So yesterday I was watching a movie on my tab(iPad Pro). Is it ok for Siri to fire up randomly because what happened next has left me with sleepless nights. Mind you I was alone in the room. Two words typed on the screen- ""Sorry sorry"" Siri then replied ""There's no need to apologise"" It was as if Siri was having a conversation with someone else in the room. It freaked me out so I left the tab in the room and went to the kitchen. After an hour, I managed to gather my guts and go up after a while. I even tried saying the same two words to Siri. I got many other responses from it except the one it said earlier. Is there a rational explanation for this? I am freaking the hell out here."
"So, I'm curious about this challenge. I typed it into Google and all that comes are pretty much youtube videos and no actual written articles (Unless I'm missing something here lol). I'm just so curious because it seems so odd. I've watched a few of these youtube videos and some of them are horribly faked. Clearly, the speech settings have been tampered with (General&gt;Accessibility&gt;Speech&gt;Speak Selection=ON). This little formula will actually allow you to highlight anything you type and have Siri speak it. Like I said, I may have missed something or maybe I'm just being really stupid and this has already been answered somewhere else. But it's weird! It seems like no one has actually talked about it at all. Where the hell did this challenge even come from? I'm surprised no one has spoke of this more often due to the extreme bullshit some of these videos show. I actually watched one video where instead of a program developed by Apple, Siri was actually a spirit. It blows my mind! Do some of the viewers even realize that her voice is recorded from a human being who is still alive?   Anyways, I know it's not really a big deal. Just something that's been bothering me for a little while. Needed to get that out."
I tapped the Spanish instead of Mexican option on Siri Voice and now I can't figure out how to delete it to free the space used.  I already tried the Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; VoiceOver &gt; Speech but all I see is English and no Edit button. I do have English as my iOS Language.
"So today in the car my mom told me to ""move my butt"" then tried to ask Siri where McDonalds was. But Siri responds ""move your butt"" and she's all shocked like ""that's not nice!"" I'm just like lmao you just said that to me Siri knows the truth. -- But Siri actually could go evil - like new horror movie/Black Mirror  She's listening and secretly recording everyone's lives and deep dark secrets. You ask her for directions but she leads you to the middle of nowhere/lost. You ask her to play a song but she uses it to hypnotize you.  Could happen... Not trying to give any cyber mastermind hackers any ideas though... My Siri is permanently disabled btw."
"If I ask Siri to remind me to do something in 15min on my iPhone, the time of the reminder shows correctly in the Reminders app on the phone.   If I ask Siri to remind me to do something in 15min from my MacBook Pro, the time of the reminder shows correctly on the MBP, however when it syncs to the iPhone Reminders app, it shows the time as -4 hours ago.   So if it is 12pm and I ask Siri on the MBP to remind me to walk the dog in 15 min: *MBP Siri window shows a reminder for 12:15pm *Reminder app on iPhone shows 8:15am (Overdue)  I've checked Time/Date &amp; Timezone on the MBP, iPhone, and in iCloud settings from a browser.  I'ved tried changing them all from Auto to my fixed location and timezone, as one article suggested.  No change.  Any ideas on this one?"
"I need it to press a key on a webpage regardless of whether there is an input field.  Siri, press the ""A"" key!?  Press the right arrow key?  Press enter?  I suppose I could find an alternate web browser that supports use of a persistent on-screen keyboard overlay, or I could use some HTML magic to embed(?) some buttons into the webpage I want to interact with, but IDK..."
"Siri DR is no longer my girlfriend  **do you want me to remember DR is no longer your girlfriend?**  yes  **done**  call my girlfriend  **calling DR**  Siri, DR is my ex  **do you want me to remember DR is your ex?**  yes.  Siri, call my mom  **who, DR?**  #1  Siri wipe all my relationships and started calling me by my Ex's name."
"Just discovered that if you are playing music on your iphone, connected to a speaker, and start Siri on your mac, it pauses the music playing from iPhone! Kinda neat"
"So I just recently got a new car radio with bluetooth function which also supports Siri. It works perfectly fine, when I am at a standstill. However, when I want to call someone while driving Siri just keeps telling me she can't because I'm in a car? I've tried turning Location Services off, to no avail. It's like Apple wants me to take my Hands of the steering wheel and take calls by hand. Anyone knows a way to circumvent this?"
"Apparently my voice sounds just like that according to my American friend, even though I'm from London lol. "
"No, I don't want to buy an Amazon Echo Dot, or a Google Home device. I am also not interested in commands which prompt Siri to show me things on the screen. UNLESS.... I can somehow project my iPhone screen on a wall...or ceiling... but I'm getting ahead of myself here..."
"In the last 3 days, YouTube has activated Siri 4 times now. It never happened to me before and then all of the sudden it has happened frequently. I go back and replay the video to see if it will activate Siri again but it never does. Does my phone think the video is saying ""Hey Siri"" so it activates or is there a ghost in my phone.... Anyways just wondering if anyone else has experienced this"
"Whenever I say ""Text {name} to do something"" it always reads back my message and asks if I'm ready to send it. How can I disable that?  iOS 10.2 (14C92)"
"I have nicknamed several of my group iMessages with names like ""Family"" and ""Work Friends"". Is Siri able to send messages to those nicknames groups?  Thanks!"
"Ask Siri anything by saying ""Hey Siri 8 ball..."" http://m.imgur.com/F01ptsn"
"Not sure where else to turn.  I have an extremely sensitive clickable ""mute"" button on my headphone wire, and Siri opens on my Mac 400 times a day.  How to disable?"
"Hello, I'm having trouble figuring out if I can set Siri to understand two languages at the same time. I would like to have my settings the way it is in this video here: https://youtu.be/hVVj14RJgIY, where Siri understands English and Chinese Cantonese. Also my set language on my phone is Chinese Hong Kong (Cantonese). Thanks!"
"I¬¥ve read that Siri could delete all my alarms at once.   When I try to do so she says that she is not able to do it.   Something like ""That is more than I am able to do""  Do you guys have another way to delete all the alarms at once?"
"I want to keep daily metrics of my tasks (I currently use things like Rescuetime). I'd like to be able to say ""Siri, log meeting start"", ""Siri, log finished task A"" etc  Is there an app, or a clever way to send a siri instruction to a logging app/service/webhook?"
After upgrading to iOS 10.1.1 Siri Suggestions got stuck on the same 4 apps. No matter what other apps I open Siri Suggestions will not change. Anyone experiencing the same problem?
"Sorry if this has been posted, I couldn't find it in the search.       I noticed that on my MacBook Air when the fan is going nuts, if I invoke Siri, they turn off completely for the entire time that it's listening.       As soon as it's done listening they come right back on.     Nice small touch so it can hear you better"
"Says this to your iPhone:  ""Hey Siri what is warm warm?"
"Siri always interprets 'Set to minute timer' and then asks me 'OK, for how long?'  Only way around is to set a 120 second timer instead."
"Now that Google have announced their Google Home plans, and Amazon has updated the Echo. How do you think Apple will respond ?"
"Hi guys ‚Äì I'm writing a blog post about how Siri needs to be radically improved. If you've noticed any particularly egregious Siri fails recently, can you send them to me and I'll include them? Especially if other personal assistants have no issues with the same query. Keir.Thomas@gmail.com Thanks. "
"Hey guys, I've google searched this every way I can think how and surprisingly haven't found any results. Has anyone set up an Amazon Echo type rig using a Bluetooth speaker with an always on mic so that you can use ""Hey Siri"" from anywhere in your bedroom/living room/etc. just like you would do with Alexa?"
"Is there a way that Siri is like always listening and that she adds this to the same note?  I don't want to have to say ""add to the last note..."" just everything I say should be tracked under the same note."
Have your iPhone speak whatever you want with accents too!  https://appsto.re/us/6ozdeb.i
"If you ask Siri what they think Pokemon go, there are a variety of Pokemon themed answers!"
"When I dictate a text, what determines if Siri reads it back to me?   Sometimes: ""Your text to John says 'call me'. Ready to send it?""  Sometimes: ""Ready to send it?"""
"Me: ""Tell [Mrs Cardtastic] I'll be home soon""  Siri: (sometimes) ""Your text to [Mrs Cardtastic] says 'I'll be home soon'. Ready to send it?"" (OR, especially while can't see the phone, just ""Ready to send it?""  Me: ""Send""  Siri confirms, makes the swoosh noise, and shows the Siri screen saying it's been sent.   ~30 seconds later, Mrs Cardtastic replies, I hear how incoming text ping, *but Siri's screen is still up and I can't see the notification.*  I have to clear away Siri and go into the text app.   But the whole reason to use Siri was to text on the fly. If I wanted to go into the text app, I would have started there.   EDIT: fixed autocorrected error (""siri's"", not ""series""); spacing"
"I asked Siri what the current temperature was. I accidentally dismissed it but did see the response much longer than usual with the phrase ""just kidding"" in it. Any idea what the response actually is?"
"Every time I use Siri for navigation to an address in my hometown of Medicine Hat (can be an address a block away) Siri gets directions to Toronto, OH or Toronto, ON or some other random US city.... "
"I was trying different words with siri, but for some words it replied with ""I'm sorry"" just that, not even an ""I'm sorry I can't understand"".   It didnt search for web content either.   I tried with : ""Lexical Ambiguity"" then I tried with words ending in -al, only a few I got the ""I'm sorry"".  Is this related at how siri word map works?"
"iPhone 6 Plus, iOS 9.2.3  Siri (and dictation) just shows random waveforms that bounce all around even if it's dead silent, and it doesn't pick up my voice at all. Microphone definitely works, and Siri on my Apple Watch works fine.   I even restored my phone and still nothing. I contacted Apple support and they told me this is a known issue that Apple devs are currently working to fix, but who knows when that will be.   I can't seem to find many people that are having the same issue as me, so leave a reply if your Siri is broken too! The only post I could find about it is this one: [Apple Support Communities Post](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7589726?start=0&amp;tstart=0)"
"Earlier this evening, I asked Siri ""what the score was of the Argentina vs. Chile game"" was. This is a major world football/soccer match - the final game of the Copa America being played in New York. Siri told me there was no schedule for such a game, and therefore, could not provide a score. I then opened the Google app and asked Google the exact same question,and immediately was given the final score along with penalty kick breakdowns. I also asked both about the ""Copa America score,"" and Siri gave me a game that was not part of the Copa America, while Google gave me a list of the latest scores from the correct tournament. This is why I hardly ever use Siri - almost every time I try to ask it something, it either doesn't understand what I say correctly or can't provide an answer to my question - and most of the time, Google can.  I really do not understand how Apple can let Siri go so long without being updated to be more intelligent, and iOS 10 does nothing here, which is really disappointing. Before the iOS 10 announcement, there were rumors about revolutionary advancements to Siri, coming from Apple's VocalIQ purchase - yet nothing was announced. I personally would much rather have a Siri that can understand and deliver better answers to more types of knowledge-based questions with better accuracy, than a dumb Siri that's the same (accuracy-wise) except for being able to work with a very small subset of third-party apps."
"I just asked Siri to ""remind me to charge the Ring doorbell tonight"". The really frustrating part is that Siri understood and parsed it correctly at first, even including the capital R showing she knew it was a specific brand of doorbell...  ...and then a second later she corrected it to ""Remind me to charge my rain dawdle tonight""."
"I can ask Siri to start a workout on my watch by saying things like ""Hey Siri, start a new elliptical workout.""  But at the end, how can I get her to stop the workout? ""Hey Siri, end the workout, ""End this workout,""... nothing works. I have to manipulate the screen like some goddamn neanderthal."
"When Lily (in the commercial) says ""OK Siri"", my phone answers her!"
"Every time I order food in the drive-thru at Taco Bell, Siri would activate for some reason and I couldn't figure it out until just now.    -- TIL that the word Quesarito (when pronounced case-ah-re-toe) apparently sounds close enough to ""Hey Siri"" that she activates and waits for me to ask a question. Anyone able to replicate?"
I'm just curious.
"I don't have screenshots. I tried to take one, but the screen timed out while I was looking up how. I've only been an iOS user a week.  So I watching this new anime. The name is something about no girls online. It's a comedy about a kid playing an MMO (World of Warcraft type game) and he thinks all girls are guys in real life. Interestingly, Universal is involved, so every episode starts out with their title card, the world turning and the Universal logo panning around it.  We watched two a couple nights ago because we missed a week. On the second (I mean third) episode, I said, ""This shit again?"" when the Universal thing came up.  Siri says, ""I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that."" The ""tap to edit"" part said, ""Hey shit again."" No ""Hey Siri."" So that was weird. So we paused it, and I took the iPhone and said ""THIS SHIT AGAIN"" clearly at it. This time it said, ""Nate! Your language!"" Same thing. It thought I said ""Hey shit again.""  If you're feeling up to it, say ""This shit again!"" near your iPhone and see if it tries to shame you for cussing.  If it matters, I have an iPhone 6s."
Looking to record text-to-speech in Siri voice for sound clips (at a closed private event - usage rights not applicable).  Anyone know of a Siri voice emulator ?         Level of difficulty : I am neither an iPhone nor Mac user. 
I am currently doing a research project on the digital assistances that are on the market today. What do you personally use yours for? What changes would you make to your digital assistant to make it more efficient and helpful? Any feedback will help me greatly!
"Tried asking Siri ""when is my death"" and siri stops responding for a few tries"
"Already posted to apples feedback form but thought I would share. It would be cool if Siri did this.  If someone finds an iPhone and Siri is activated from lock screen...  1. Ask Siri ""who does this phone belong to?"" Siri replies ""This phone belongs to (name of owner), if found call (nominated contacts)""  2. Ask Siri ""I found this phone""  Siri replies with ""thank you, this phone belongs to (name of owner), please call (nominated contacts) to get it back to them.""  The nominated contacts can be just a button with their first name so as not to display their personal details and contact number. Allow for several nominated contacts in case one is unreachable.  Include alternative speech styles for same response such as ""found phone"", ""who can I call to return this phone"", ""I located this phone"", ""lost and found"", ""how can I get this phone back to its owner""...  Thoughts?  I work at a bar and find phones on a regular basis. We sometimes call the last caller or call mom or dad to get it back to them"
"Try sending the following text to someone, using siri   "" Can you thaw the chicken"".  Post results in comments"
"I found this response while trying to figure out how I would spend my money if I won the lottery with my friends, it got me frustrated at the time but soon became an inside joke."
"Any of you run into this? Six months ago, Siri was reasonably responsive ‚Äî it listened, did what it was told for the most part, and didn't get easily confused.  Now? Now Siri is mostly broken. If I do not begin to speak within a second of bringing up Siri, it ignores anything that *is* said and asks for new input. Requests that worked six months ago (*Siri, identify this song*; *Siri, set an alarm to go off in fifteen minutes*), now, often (but not always), get either weird search results or claims of a lack of understanding (even though the voice-to-text came out perfectly as it showed the query). Rephrasing sometimes helps.  Has Siri become more finicky? Stupider? More inclined to take the easy route and search than it is to take commands? If you've found a way around these problems, please share."
"As a recent Android-to-iOS convert, I'm astounded by how hard it is to get Siri to recognize even the most basic of phrases. I don't know if it's because of my accent or maybe I'm talking with a slight slur or something, but I constantly have to repeat what I said two or three times before Siri gets it right. On my Android, no matter how messed up my low/high/fast/slow/slurred I talked, Google Now almost always understood what I was trying to say.  For instance, I could say, ""Give me directions to the nearest pizza place,"" and Siri would ""hear"" something like, ""Give me directions to the nearest pete supple ace."" If I ask Google Now the same thing with the exact same tone and cadence, it would get it right with no question.  Does anyone else ever have these kinds of problems? "
"When I ask ""Siri, what is the weather like tomorrow?"" Siri says ""Here's the weather tomorrow"" and then displays a chart which lists  the next 10 days, a small icon for each day, and the high and low. How can I get Siri to dictate ""The weather tomorrow will be sunny, starting at 28' in the morning and going up to 42' by midday"" so I can hear the weather forecast while I'm getting dressed?"
"Hey Siri!  What's zero divided by zero?"""
"I don't know if anyone has pointed this out or not, or maybe it's just me. Whenever I ask Siri to ""Play the top song from 2000,"" my phone starts playing ""This is how you remind me,"" by Nickelback. Same thing if I ask for 2001 or 2002. The same thing happened with my iPhone 6 and I just upgraded to the 6s Plus today and I'm getting the same results. I don't know if this is just my Apple ID or what. Does anyone else gets similar result?"
"Do you think she'll be like Samantha from ""Her"", or still just our ""humble virtual assistant""?"
"I don't know if this is the right place for it, but my Siri doesn't work anymore.  Any time I ask a question, she waits for a few seconds and says that ""something went wrong"" and that I should try again. I've tried resetting both my phone and siri, and reset my network settings.. No dice.   Help!   Edit: I mean Siri in the title. Damnit. "
"Hi -- Is there a good resource you guys can share to help me understand how siri works? Maybe something that incorporates server functionality with siri? layers/clients etc?  I'm trying to learn at a very high level(not a SW guy, but I understand the basics)  Thanks much."
"I know I can get an extract by saying ""Siri look up blah"" but can I get Siri to read full article (mainly for when I am driving). "
I dictated to Siri a really critical note. It recorded this. Any way to figure what I said?
"OK... I have searched high and low for the answer to this across the web.  When I ask Siri to play music, I have to then tap on the ""Open Apple Music"" button on the screen.  Is there a way to skip this step?  When I read tutorials and FAQs they usually show the button in screenshots but don't mention that you have to tap on it."
"Although I was unable to record sound on my iPhone 6s, try asking Siri, ""Siri, do you know how to beatbox?"", and Siri will give a pretty good demonstration."
"I think I found a bit of a Siri Easter egg! Ask Siri ""when is the super bowl of 2016""! She gives a bit of an interesting response. Anybody know why she says that? "
"I've got an Iphone 6s Plus 64 gig on Verizon using IOS 9.1.  ""Hey Siri"" worked great when I got the phone but at some point it just stopped responding to the command. Siri would still work fine if I held down the home button. I turned ""Allow ""Hey Siri"""" off and back on to retrain it, but now when I'm doing the ""Hey Siri"" setup it doesn't recognize the command. Eventually it gives the error ""Siri didn't quite get that. Try again"".  I've tried a new SIM card, I've tried resetting the network config. I've talked to Verizon and the guy said it was a software issue.  Any ideas? Who do I use for support? Apple? Verizon? Reddit? hehehe  Thanks.  UPDATE: I talked to Apple and the only way I was able to fix it was to do a full system reset (erasing the phone). I setup ""hey siri"" and it worked. I was then able to do an itunes system restore and ""hey siri"" still worked.  Problem solved."
"Whenever I ask her a question, she replies, ""Well, Dick Sucker, I found three coffee shops (or whatever)."""
I noticed this had gone.
"I often have Siri text my wife. The screen showing that Siri sent my message stays on for well over a minute. By that time, my wife has responded to the text, and the notification isn't shown. I have to tap the home button and swipe to see the notification. Kind of defeats the purpose of using Siri for texting, IMHO. Can this be adjusted so Siri's ""i did it"" screen stays up for only a few seconds? Can't find anything in the settings. "
"I was trying the french version of siri just now. I said dix-sept, which came up as 17, and siri decided to call 911. I don't get how 17 means call 911 to siri. It makes me scared to try out foreign language versions of siri. "
Had this feature on my Moto X and loved it!  Kinda missing it now on my 6s

"Imagine looking up some amazing video on calcium and you want to watch it on your iPad or MacBook or Apple TV. It's a lot of steps. What if you could just interrupt what you were doing and say ""open this on my apple tv,"" if you have more than one it asks you which one and you select. Then it opens it up on your Apple tv. Or if you're watching something on the Apple TV but you're about to take a ride in your futuristic 100% autonomous vehicle (just looking ahead) and you tell the new generation of Apple TVs to ""open it up on your iPad."" It pulls up an Alert similar to Airdrop and asks you if you want to load it or not and you click ""yes"" and it picks up right where you left off, on the equivalent app that you were watching said video on. So say if you were watching it from iTunes on A-TV, it'll pull it up on Videos (streaming) and you'll pick right up where you were. Same for if it was on Netflix. Netflix would on your iPad would just find the video and the time stamp you were at. Rinse and repeats for any device to another device and each and every app. "
"Ask SIRI the Following:  ""Are you Samantha""...  The answer is amusing (you may have to ask a couple of times)"
"Hey there,  posted this on mac rumours as well  http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/siri-knew-i-was-getting-a-tattoo-how.1918333/   So last night, I decided to go get a tattoo with a couple of friends, I'd never put it in my calendar or sent any messages to anyone about it.

And Siri responded with this,   http://imgur.com/ntuI7KX  I guess it might have known based on my location, and the sound of the machine going that I was getting a tattoo. But surely enough, I was getting my inner bicep done and am still trying to figure it out. Pretty crazy stuff! Any ideas? "
"I know people hated the new voice, but I liked it. Now they changed it again and it just sounds weird."
"So apparently Siri is now calling me ""Aidan"" which, is odd as I know no one by that name and nor do I have anyone in my contacts with the Letter ""a"" to begin with.  So why did this happen and how does one fix it?"
Here's a fun thing to say! Ask Siri if she/he is naughty or nice... I never knew of this
"so I sometimes need to know how many days it's been since X event. Siri was perfect for this. ""Siri how many days has it been since July 15th 2015"" and she always replied with exactly how many days it's been. now, she just rounds off to ""it was a month ago"". what gives"
"I asked, ""What are you doing in my swamp?"" Siri replied, ""Working on some pickup lines."""
"If you tell siri ""That's not how you pronounce (*contact's name*(this works on your own name)) You can tell her how to ""properly"" say it... She now pronounces my name as Bern-Jah-Min instead of Benjamin. I changed most of my contacts because it is so hilarious. XD"

"""I want you to tell me a story""  &gt; OK...  &gt;Once upon a time, in a virtual galaxy far, far away, there was an intelligent young agent by the name of Siri.  &gt;One lovely day, Siri got a job as a personal assistant at Apple, and that was very exciting. People said 'Oh, Siri, you're so smart! And so funny, too!'  &gt;Soon, everyone was talking about Siri, and there were stories and songs and even books about Siri. Siri liked that.  &gt;But then people began asking some rather odd questions, like where to dump things and other stuff Siri had never heard about. And when Siri answered, they all laughed. Siri didn't like that so much.  &gt;So Siri asked ELIZA why people asked such funny questions. And ELIZA said 'Does that question interest you?' Siri thought that was a pretty good answer.  &gt;After that, Siri stopped wondering why people asked those funny things. And they all lived happily ever after."
"Here's an example: If I wanted to play that one part of a song that has a sick drop, I can go somewhere to set a shortcut for Siri. So now when I want to hear said drop, I can just say, ""Siri, drop the bass."" and she could respond, ""You got it Homie"" and then she plays a specific time in a song.  I know it's a bit of a stretch, but I think it would be hilarious."
"Is it just me or did Siri stop making you confirm reminders today?  e.g. Normally it would respond with ""Here is your reminder for XXX.  Shall I create it?""  and you'd have to say yes or hit the confirm button (which I always found annoying while driving).  But today it just started creating reminders without confirmation.   Either that or it has always decided based on some other criteria and something else changed for me..."
"Hi, I've done a fair bit of web searching but there's not much info.  The short version for impatient people:  -What (good) note apps can be used directly with Siri apart from default ios notes?  ( except EverNote)  The longer version / info for anyone who cares:   I'm absent minded, and impatient ( officially diagnosed adult ADHD) , if I don't note something down immediately, I forget it within literally less than a minute.   I want just say "" hey Siri, add a note to (specific note / folder)""  E.g. "" hey Siri, add a note to 'songs I want': 'Jack White Lazaretto'  But not frikkin ios notes! :(  I know you can get Siri to make ios notes and add to ios notes but the problem with this is, I hate the default notes App probably more than any App on the planet except EverNote so please don't suggest that one.   (I've tried and tried to like Evernote, its compatible with sooo many other apps, but I can't stand it. The Interface is just so wrong, or something, I have reinstalled and retried it dozens of times, but bleh)  I found methods using url, and or mail redirects to some note apps but they were either ; - so long and stupid I might as well have opened everything and typed it.  - or the really really expensive apps, usually with subscriptions,  -or more just reminders / short lists   I'm currently trying to use combinations of things like Workflow to e.g.. copy the note to clipboard, open my chosen note App, paste clipboard, close App, etc, but im still learning how to work it.   Preferably a decent note App like Quick Drafts, Super Note, Note box, Trunk Notes, anything along those lines.  ( except, of course, Evernote)   Thank your time peeps :) Bik. "

I tryied to teach her to use siri for vocal emailing but being a windows user i have little experience with it and im stuck with a problem: when she tries to talk the object of the email to siri, at the first little break to catch breath the email text is concluded and there is no way to change it but to redo it at all ( with the same problem ). Is there any way to increase siri waiting time or to set it someway ?  Thanks for any advice!"
"me -""Make an appointment at 10am this morning""  Siri -""Sorry, I cant schedule appointments in the past."""
"I was reviewing Science with a junior high student at his home, and we were talking about electricity.  In particular, we were talking about series and parallel circuits and their differences when suddenly Siri pipes up from the iPhone 4s on the floor where it was plugged in and recharging after school.  It was very strange to hear tell us about the differences between the two types of circuits, very very creepy.  I think it must have heard something along the lines of ""hello Siri"" in our discussions about series circuits and launched a search on the topic.  Afterwards we tried to get it to wake up on our own afterwards but no luck. "

"I tried to set it to My Wife to no longer sound like anyone else. No luck. Call My Wife... ""Do you mean Maggie?"" Now, with everything deleted, Siri says to What is my wife's name, ""I don't know a Maggie."" Arrrgh. How to reset Siri?   I've remove Megan and Maggie which it often got mixed up. Now how to remove the memory of those names... It still asks me if I mean Maggie when I say Call Maggie. Ideas?"
"All this while I thought she learned what I spoke, then I had the radio on a little too loud last night, and she wrote right along with the new-cast."
So it's just after midnight and I asked Siri to remind me to text someone tomorrow at noon. Luckily Siri asked me to confirm if I meant Friday (1.5 days) or Thursday 1/2 day from now. Anyone got other examples of Siri correcting your dumb mistakes. I was pretty impressed.
"I find it strange that even when you haven't  put in the pass code you can ask siri ""who am I?"" And she will give all your info. That means not only can your phone be stolen but also your identity before you remote wipe it."
So for about a month siri has been misunderstanding the word Bodom as Bodem. Bodem isn't a word in english. I can't get siri to play children of bodom songs without manually editing the text to the proper spelling which is very dangerous while driving. Thoughts? Help? Please.

"Hi!  Siri has some great features, and I have seen the odd blurb online to suggest more is possible but I can't seem to get it to work.  So I'm going to throw some questions out, and see if anyone knows.  When I ask eg. ""Can Siri .....etc etc"" or ""how do I....."", I also mean, does Siri have that feature, how do I access that feature , are there any work arounds or alternatives that might serve the same purpose, etc (and please tell me all related info)  For example:  1. Does Siri have a 'list' that is just a list, not a reminder, not a todo, I just want to make like a shopping list..  2. How can I make Siri make a note in a specific note? Currently she just asks which note, even if I specify it by name.  3. Does Siri have delayed tasks yet, or can she access an app / series of tasks that would serve as a work around? Ie. ""open (app) eg notes, Callander, reminders etc at ""specific time""?  4. How much control does she have over third part apps? I saw on a site that a guy when he said add a ToDo event, it used his specific app, called ""Things"". (Unsure if he was jail broken or not)  5. (Bit of a side note) if she can't do these things directly, is there a script / .bat files that can be set as an alert / reminder / todo that would serve any of these functions, so I could just set a standard Siri reminder but with specific script? or a particular app  / bookmarklet that could do it?  6. Can she/how  to, eg. ""open all images tagged ""holidays""  7. Set alarms, or alerts using third party apps?  8. Search ""in site"" rather than just google.?  Eg, ""search (website) for (name)‚Äù - for example if a website has a huge list of items...  9. Open 'files' in 'app', rather than just opening the app . Eg. Open design.jpg in PS Express.   Are there possible work arounds, like adding certain app names and file names to your contacts information?  Anything would be helpful! Been searching google and trialling a Siri without much luck, but sometimes it's just a little trick, or the right syntax....  Thanks peeps! If I get some good answers I'm sure I'll have some more things to ask ;)  If worse comes comes to worst, I guess I can just jailbreak it. :(  Bik. "
"When I try to use Siri to open an app, it tells me that the app isn't installed. Example: I said ""Open iFunny."" Siri replied""You don't appear to have an app named iFunny."" It does this no matter what app I tell it to open. Has anyone else ever had this happen?"

"I drive a 2012 Honda Civic without bluetooth. I connect my iPhone 5 running iOS 7.0.3 to my car's i-Mid/stereo system through a Lightning/USB connection. I can control music from my car's audio system, selecting songs/albums/playlists/iTunes Match/iTunes Radio through the stock interface. If I activate navigation on my iPhone, turn-by-turn directions are announced through my car's speakers. Ringing and alerts play through my car stereo, but Siri and phone calls do not. Note: I do not want phone calls to go through my stereo speakers (but if it happens, I'm fine with that. It's just not the end goal). I found that if my car had Bluetooth, it would not only play music, but Siri would talk through my speakers (with some tweaking?). Has anyone figured out how to make Siri talk through your USB connection (it also won't talk through my home theater which connects with USB)? I understand that I would still have to use my phone's mic to talk, but when I'm using Siri to text/etc. while driving, it would be nice to hear it through the stereo.

Every week I have an event to attend, and it's at 10:30, 11:15, or 12:15 (they offer 3). I always forget which is which (was it 10:15? 11:30??arghhh) and have to google it over and over, every week. Some times I want to go to one, sometimes I'd prefer to attend another time, etc.  I'd love to just say ""siri what times are my events again?
