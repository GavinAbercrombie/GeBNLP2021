"Hello there,  my google assistant behaves very weird. Logged in to my main google account it changes the activation tone to a piano chord and becomes very unresponsive in comparison to the normal behavior when activated on my locked phone. If i change the account to my second google account, the normal tone play and the assistant is more responsive.  Sometime the assistant decides not to respond at all, when my phone is locked. But my ""hey google"" was recognized and when i activate my screen google appears.  In some occasions the assistant takes a long time understanding and suddenly changes the language from German to English, displays similar sounding English words and says ""something went wrong, please try again"". At that point i need to restart my phone or clear the memory...  60% of the time i try to use google it won't work, although i love using the assistant.  Maybe you guys could help me..."
"So I live in care and I can not say much more then that. I have a Google best hub max in my room and a google smart speaker. I have some Philip hue lights as well they are grouped as shown  The main group contains lights as follows   theorangepan light 1   theorangepan light 2   theorangepan light 3   theorangepan light 4   theorangepan light 5   theorangepan light 6   There are two Futher groups I created today in the smart life app   theorangepan even lights   theorangepan light 2   theorangepan light 4    theorangepan light 6   and  theorangepan odd lights   theorangepan light 1   theorangepan light 3   theorangepan light 5  the smart life app is linked to the Google home app and the lights can be controlled through Google assistant.  The issue I have is when ever I say ""hey Google set theorangepan even lights to (colour) "" google will set change only theorangepan light 2 or change all of them.  This is the same if I use theorangepan odd lights.  I often change the colours of the bulbs create patters or to fit my mood. The even and the odd group are simply to make it easier and quicker to create a colour Scape with the lights.  If Google assistant can't respond to me correctly then it defeats the purpose of making these two groups.  Can anyone help me with this ?  Please note  theorangepan is a fake name as being in care I am not allowed to use my real name."
I ride a motorcycle and my helmet has a button for google assistant. The only drawback is once it's done it stays on the screen blocking my navigation app. Is there anyway to make assistant go away after it's done?
"Hello! Hope it is okay for me to post this on here? As part of my Master's thesis, I’m doing a research project at the University of Amsterdam where I look into users’ relationships to voice assistants within the home – and I was wondering if anyone would be interested in taking part in the project? The research looks into the role of digital assistants in the home, and involves doing an informal interview with me over Zoom! Would be great to hear from you. Thanks!"
"Got my lg tv and, lazy me, didn't really feel like typing everything with the remote and used the. The option to activate the Google assistant (works simultaneously with the TV's AI) poped up and i deeply regret it accepting since it is too anoying.  I have to say ""search on google *this thing*"" or else I'm getting a ""I didn't quite understand what you said"". Can somebody PLEASE tell me how to deactivate it ????"
"Hi, I have the redmi note 8 pro and I used to had the new ui before but I noticed it's completely gone now. Everything is up to date."
I've been noticing that my Google Assistant will randomly Pop up when I'm watching a YouTube video or sometimes if I'm playing a game it will suddenly Pop up and I will not say anything!!! What can I do about this and how do I fix it??
I'm wanting to set the assistant to wake me up at sunrise by giving me weather updates and reading my texts and the time but it won't audibly say anything. It'll just pop up with a visual notification acknowledging 7 different routine jobs. I just the 1st set to turn up media volume to 💯. What else do I need to do?
"So I'm looking into a nest hub. However, I also have a google pixel meaning that I don't want both to activate so I was wondering if there is a way to only have the hub work. But still have the phone one work whilst I'm not at home if that makes sense?"
"I honestly don't know if this is an Assistant issue, Maps issue or an Android Auto issue. But as of recently, when ever I ask google to find me something lets say Tim Hortons. It will pull up locations that are not exactly close to me. Every time I ask it to take me to X location (Gas, Food, Tim Hortons, Montana's, Kelsey's, Costco...etc) I will get a location that is over an hour away or 40 KM away. I have even gotten a place in a completely different providence then me before.  I then manually type in the same thing I just asked for and it instantly find locations near me. I even asked google for my current location and it provided the correct location information. But even manually entering Tim Hortons or Gas or anything really when I am just looking for closest place for X Y Z. Is now starting to sometimes show me locations that is no where close to me even though I know there is 5 places 1/4 of the distance and time away."
"My dad just got a new Samsung Galaxy A31 (I have the exact same phone) and he likes to use the Google Assistant to make calls while he's driving. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to working for him. He can use the assistant to send text messages just fine but not calls. I've tried everything from resetting his Google settings, to ressetting the app to making sure his contacts are saved to his Google account. I've also tried it on my phone and it seems to be working just fine. Any ideas on what the issue may be?"
"For example, I'm at home right now and I asked the assistant on my phone where I am, and it told me my cousin's address, which is where I was twenty minutes ago.  My phone has options to only allow location access while a certain app is open, and it appears that the assistant assumes I'm where I last opened the Google Maps app. I gave all Google Maps and Assistant related apps permission to access my location all the time. I'm using a OnePlus Nord N100.  This threw me off earlier when I couldn't figure out what street I was on in a part of town I don't go often and it was giving me my home address."
"Hello, I have a Mi Note 10 Lite running Android 11. Some time ago I received an update that changed the assistant UI to the ""light bar"". But out of the blue, it's now the old design. I see other people running Miui with the new design. Is there something I can do about it?"
"I've tried changing the pitch and speed, and it sounds normal in the test settings, but if she reads any answers or notifies me of an alarm it is at 1/3 speed...  Any ideas?"
"I want to say to Google: hey google, set binary sunset. Then I want it to set my lights in a certain mood (which i found out so far) and play the epic music part of binary sunset (star wars).  Now i tried it with ifttt, but there i can only do two commands at a time in the free version and I don't really wanna get pro for this one giggle. Are there alternatives?  And is it even possible? On spotify, I've found the track, but it take some time to get to the point with the part I want to play. On Youtube I've found a Video with exactly the part I need, but I couldn't find out if I can play it with a command. Is it an option to have the audio data on a device like my smartphone?"
"My Q app is linked to Google Assistant, but when I say Hey Google, ""open my garage door"" all it does is open the MyQ app and does nothing else?  [This is the MyQ device I have.](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8/ref=sr_1_5?crid=J7CONZMBXX0S&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=my+que+garage+door+opener&amp;qid=1615813090&amp;sprefix=my+q%2Caps%2C183&amp;sr=8-5)  I'm starting to thing it only works with the actual smart garage door opener not just the hub thing.   Any advice?"

"Talking about the home devices not on phone. Has anyone noticed a difference in the responsiveness/response times for the google assistant devices? Have had the original google home device for several years. I'm in the same room with the device and it doesn't register my wake up command. I'm not overly loud, but sometimes a device in another room will respond instead of the device that's in the same room that I'm in. Been getting worse and starting to become annoying."
"I've suffered a brain injury that affected my speech. Alexa adjusted fairly well, but I cannot get Google Assistant to understand me enough to trigger the wakeup command. Does anyone have any ideas or tips for getting things working for me again?"
"Pls help, thanks in advance, also did I put the flair right?"
"Hey all, when I try and get the Assistant to read a page out loud, it now says that it doesn't see a web page on the screen, even though I am clearly on a webpage. What gives?? It was working just a few days ago."
How can I disable corner activation of assistant? Just use the assistant from swiping from corner few times it will go away.
"Hey, although GA seems like it is able to operate in its own language, i've hit an obstacle. On my new lenovo yoga smart tab I need to have system in language, that is not supported by GA. And even though I have set GA language to US english,  ambient mode and other functions (like setting default music player for GA) is not working. When i set system language to english as well, everything works just fine.  Did anyone figure out how to bypass this and have fully working GA in english on different language system?"
"I was just watching spooky videos with my wife on YouTube late at night. I was speaking phrases out loud such as ""im so scared!!!"" And ""im freaking out!"" and ALL OF A SUDDEN my Google Home device said ""Don't worry, we can be brave together."" But I didn't say ""ok google"" ""hey google"" or the word google whatsoever?! Has anyone else experienced this phenomenon?   I tried recreating the results by speaking the same things again, but Google never spoke again, what has happened here?  I was half joking from the youtube videos, but Google talking to me unprompted was the real scare here..."
Where did it go? I've gone through all the Google Assistant settings and can't find it on my Note 20 Ultra. Articles only show the old settings layout.
"I'm not sure what to try and adjust in this situation.   I'm stumped.  Assistant has all the permissions it needs, location is on, notifications are set right AND Keep loc reminders work perfectly.   Anyone?   Thanks in advance..."
"I have routines it feels the need to announce every action it's taking in a routine.  I can't use the standard/popular commands as those don't include colors, brightness, volume levels, etc etc like I can do with custom google assistant commands (where you type in what you would normally say to Google).  I don't enjoy listening to 2 minutes worth of ""ok turning this bulb red. Ok adjusting brightness of this bulb ok this bulb is unavailable. Ok turning this bulb red. Ok turning volume to 40% ok turning input to Google tv. Ok closing curtains 90%..."" And on and on and on... When I say ""ok google watch movie on Google tv"""
"Randomly when I use the google assistant, it'll turn up my phone's volume when it's giving commands. This is quite annoying. Anyone experienced the same?"
"Just today the assistant no longer has access to my calendar.   It responds with my name, which means it knows who I am, but when I try to ask for my calendar for tomorrow it shows me a google search instead of actually telling me my next appointment.  The routines 'good night' and 'good morning' work and I get calendar information there.  I have tried resetting devices, removing and adding Voice Match and removing and adding the access to both calendar and if my information is publically available or not.  Any and all ideas are welcome."
"Hello,   I get alerts for the stocks on my watchlist, but I'm living abroad so the timing of the alert is not good for me.  Is there any way to change the time this notification triggers? I can't seem to find anything in the settings nor online   Any help much appreciated."
"At bedtime, my assistant reads aloud my first upcoming appointment for the next day. That’s fantastic, but what isn’t, is she continues in a long dissertation of the complete address of the appointment. This is never needed by me. Is there a way to turn that address off without removing it from my meeting details?"
"The Assistant in my Google Nest Audio consistently announces events from my Calendar with the wrong time, 5 hours out of sync. It's the only device in my home that does this. If I ask what's on my calendar for tomorrow, it reads the events 5 hours later than they are actually scheduled.  My Pixel phone, Nest Hub and minis all get it right. How can I change the time setting?"
I got an alter/reminder to take out the trash at 9pm that i didnt set. Any ideas how that could have happened? (other then a spooky ghost using my phone) .
"A few days ago my assistant stopped waking up when I say okay google or hey google, tried the fix by google, deleting the updates and then reinstalling and not using voice match at all, it works fine if I turn it on manually and otherwise hears everything properly, with or without headphones....  Using Oneplus 8T"

"Asking google to flip a coin or roll a dice pulls up a really cute animation of it literally doing so, however sometimes it will take a bit more time to load it in than it's worth. I'd like to go efficiency over charm, so is there a way to disable the animation so it simply tells you the result?"
"I have had my voice match set up for years before this happened. I recently had issues where I could not add one of my Nest Minis to the voice match so the support representative had me remove all devices and remove my voice match entirely. Now I cannot add my voice match back whatsoever. Every time I go to turn it on, it says ""Trouble Connecting"". The rep said I need to contact my phone manufacturer but it has nothing to do with Samsung. Please help!    Several representatives did not know what to do to fix this and wanted me to factory reset all the devices(two Nest Minis and a Google Display) and even train my voice using another device other than my Galaxy S20+. I already uninstalled and reinstalled the Home app and it did not work. My GF was able to add all devices to her voice match no problem(same phone).  Any assistance is much appreciated!"
I have to turn off the voice match and turn it back on for it to work. After a while it goes back to not working so I have to turn it off and one again.
"""Ok Google, turn off kitchen light"". ***""******Ok, turning off kitchen light******""***  Bitch, don't tell me.. JUST DO IT! I am not going to assign all nine automated lights into the same room config just to force you to shut up. Fucking annoying."

"Ive tried a few IFTTT applets but  none have worked correctly. I want to make a google assistant phrase like ""ask mom"" or ""ask name"" and the nest speakers will say ""contacting name"" and send her a text or something. This would be huge for us. For some reason, no one wants to get up and walk over to touch her to get her attention so its a big item of contention. The only way she can enjoy media is to use headphones. One ear is dead and her good ear is low quality. So she cant keep one ear muff off to hear her surroundings. We've talked about a earpiece that allows outside sound in but then she cant hear and enjoy media.  I'm trying to find a smart solution where someone can just speak a phase and it lets her know that someone is trying to get her attention. She can take off her headphones and hear them. All help is appreciated. Thank you!"
"For example if I'm in my bedroom and say  ""Turn the light off"" to a home mini   Is it going to turn the rooms lights off or turn the whole houses lights off?"
"I have found at least 6 different ste by step guides, some of them only at most 3 months old that show how to enable this, but on my phone (Mi 9T) and my headphones (SoundPeats TrueCapsule) on Android 10 there simply is not a single setting in any place.  &amp;#x200B;  I checked assistant settings. Some suggested to go to ""voice"", but I have no such section in the settings. There is ""voice"" in google app settings, but it has nothing to do with devices. Then others say to go to ""devices"" in assistant settings, but whether I choose ""set up a device"" or ""link a device"", nope.  Google official support page says "" Tap **Devices** 📷 **Your headphones** "", but there is no ""Your headphones"" section here.  What gives? Are they shuffling and changing"
"So I use fullscreen gestures on my phone and the gesture for going to the home screen is a swipe from the bottom, when I use it I portrait mode everything is fine but when I open an app in landscape and try to go to my homescreen the gesture activates google assistant even if it's turned off. Is there a way to turn of this feature?"
"I  am a tea drinker and set timers to steep my tea. ""Ok Google, set a tea Timer for 7 minutes."" Plays I am a little tea pot and steam sounds when ready. I am finding this fun."
"After updating my phone to android 11, google assistant will no longer make a single sound. I have tried deleting data, reinstalling the app and a bunch of other things. Unfortunately, nothing solved the problem. And yes the volume is up. Im on s10 btw.   Anyone know how to fix this?"
Can’t seem to find it / link it ...
"We have two android phones and several google devices in our home. When I say ""ok google"" to my phone and ask a question it gives me the answer on one of our Google speakers rather than my phone. This is very annoying and I cannot figure out how to change it so that it answers me back on my phone. Anybody know?"
"I've gone through the threads and don't think I've seen this one:  I understand Google broke the Assistant functionality on a phone while it's locked, so I have my phone set to stay unlocked while on my person (connected to my Fitbit).  However if I say ""Hey Google"" or ""Okay Google"" the assistant will pop up, but will not be in ""listening"" mode - nothing I say is recognized. The audio bars are at full size and no text is entered no matter what I say. I have to wait for the Assistant to minimize again and try again while it's ""awake"".  I can see a rationale (thought I disagree with it) for keeping it from working while the phone's locked, even though I think it defeats the entire purpose of having a voice-activated assistant. However in my case it seems to not work even if the phone is unlocked, but just ""sleeping"".  Anyone encounter this?"
"Hello, I was wondering if there is a way to synk my google assistant's microphone to my windows 10 pc? I have managed to synk the speakers on the assistant but not the microphone.  What I want to do is be able to make a call with discord, jitisi meet etcetra on the pc and use the assistant to get a better sound. Is this possible?"
"Hello,  yesterday Google assistant started getting things wrong and mishearing me so I went into settings to retrain voice which should have been easy.  When I went to retrain it said it already had a voice model. I looked the solution up on how to stop this message and it said go into My Activity and erase the data. I did so and started assistant again which was going well until it asked me to say Ok Google. I did as told but it wasn't listening. I tried turning Hey Google off and on but every time I turn it back on it goes back to the 'say Ok Google' screen and still isn't listening.  At some point it started asking for something called 'Voice Access' and giving me directions to settings that aren't there. I don't know what to do.  My phone is a Mya-L11, Huawei phone which I have had since the year before last and have never had this problem.  What do I do?"
I recently bought the JBL Live 500bt headphones and they work with google assistant. I spent some time setting up the headphones with the app and the assistant was working fine but then when I closed the app and tried to use the google assistant it says “The Google Assistant is not connected” This means that the app has to be open for this to work which isn’t very hands free. Is there a way to get it to work without the app open?
"I have a direct shortcut on my home screen to launch the voice command/search feature of the Google app (I have it mapped to an icon swipe via Nova launcher). Previously, I could flick it and give commands like ""play artist xxx"" or ""set a timer for 15 minutes"". Now I get an error message ""Set Google as the default assist app to access your assistant"". Why, Google, why? It was working fine for years without. On my Pixel 4 i remapped active edge to toggle the flashlight, and I've done similar things on other devices. There's zero chance I'm going to break these more useful features just to appease Google to get voice commands back. I see no reasonable reason to make the app refuse to function just because I won't let it be linked the the assistant button on my devices.   Why does Google keep breaking stuff unnecessarily? Is there a way around this?"
"Question: when I say ""Hey google drive to work"" it opens Waze and shows me my route &amp; traffic etc to work. Fantastic.  When I use ""Drive to work"" in a routine it shows me a list of destinations all with words ""Work"" in it, which is annoying when there are other commands to be executed.  Any ideas why the difference."
is anybody else experiencing an issue where live transcribe does not transcribe audio when earphones or earbuds are connected? the minute I route the audio to the phone speaker live transcribe resumes and works properly does anybody know a solution to this?
"When you say Hey Google - you used to get an audible beep to know that Google is listening, now you get nothing. I understand that 'google is always listening' but its rubbish. At least when you say Hey Siri you still get the audible cue, now when using your phone you never know if its listening despite what it says."
"I said hey Google and said what's up and it replies with random weird facts like ""Hi, I've set a reminder to remind me to remind you"", and it's annoying because I just want to chat normally and it gives me information I don't need.  Another bug is that I can only say a sentence because after that everytime I tap on the microphone it just repeats what I previously dictated."
"Hey guys, I have some issue going on... I have a new phone, and Google Assistant can't open my apps for me...

"Today not one of my 18 devices is working on any of my 5 google nest mini or home max. I have lights and plugs that have worked on using Google Assistant. Today every device that I ask Google to turn off or on it says ""It looks like this device is not setup, to do that use the Google Home app.  All 18 devices are currently in the Home app and are named and said correctly. Anyone seen this bug where Google will not interact with a device that is listed in the Home app and been working just fine for months. Ps I changed nothing. This is a new bug today."
"For the last several days I've been unable to access or add anything to my ""shopping lists"" via the google assistant? It keeps giving me this message: ""Sorry, something went wrong while trying to fetch your lists."" What do I do?"
"Last evening my google assistant started answering to ""computer""  between 10pm and midnight -   This occurred while I was talking to Alexa using my trigger word ""Computer"" in parallel google began answering my questions.  At first I thought it was an anomaly being an accidental trigger work, therefore I ensured the initial command was completely finished before evoking the next five or six triggers with same results.  Has anyone else experience this odd behavior?   Is this a possible hidden future feature?       I'm running version 1.50.229149 on a home device and [2.32.1.5](https://2.32.1.5) on my phone  #accidentialtriggersGA"
"Hi, wonder if anyone has advice, have searched a few posts and forums. For some reason I am unable to create a routine using the new Sunrise or Sunset as a trigger. It will not save, get the error ""Your changes could not be saved. Please try again.""  Does this feature work in South Africa?  All apps have location permissions allowed. Is there a way to view a log file for errors?"
"Hey guys, if I'm trying to send a WhatsApp message with the Google assistant it's not working anymore and it says that the app isn't installed. Here's a screenshot of it: https://ibb.co/rf1xgZ2  Thanks in advance!"
"I've found that over the years, certain keywords don't trigger as you might expect, and/or Google interprets them differently or ignores them, and thus it attempts to do wonderful things like TURN OFF EVERY LIGHT IN THE HOUSE.  This is generally something I will never want to happen (off OR on).    Does anyone know of an override hidden somewhere to prevent this?  Basically a ""disable all whole-house requests"" switch. I'm rather tired of trying to do something like ""hey google, turn on my lights and set the color to Candlelight"", having Assistant get confused, and responding with ""Alright, turning 12 lights on. 6 devices were unavailable."" in the middle of the night while children are sleeping!   &amp;#x200B;  Come to think of it, that's a second feature I'd like to disable... the ""N devices were unavailable"" response if something is unplugged.  Show me on my app, but don't yell it over the loudspeaker every day. I can figure out if a light didn't turn on by the fact that.. it didn't turn on."
"So yeah, I want to be able to add reminders from the PC, and it's not working.  If I add the reminders from google calendar, I can see them on my phone, but I get no alert at all on any of my devices.  But if I set the reminder from assistant directly, everything works fine.  I use Keep Notes, and I can set a reminder on there, and it works flawlessly on all devices, but I don't see a way to set that as my default reminder program if I yell at assistant to set a reminder.   Is there a way to even change the default reminder program when in assistant?"
"I set a routine that:  1. Turns on my living room lights (using the function to select the lights in the list to turn them on) 2. Sets living room lights to dark red (using the typed-in command ""set living room lights to dark red"")  If I activate the routine by voice on my Nest Mini, I get ""Sorry, I can't find any lights that support colors. Please add them via the Google Home app.""  I can instantly respond, ""turn on living room lights and set to dark red"" and it will say, ""sure, setting living room lights to dark red.""  So essentially same command issued by a routine fails, but issued directly and it's a non-issue. I did originally have steps 1 and 2 reversed, and swapped them thinking maybe it couldn't set the color with them off, but nope.  Any thoughts?"
"I have a monitoring service (Think uptimerobot or the like) that in order to put monitors in maintenance mode, I'd just need to do a wget against certain URL's. Is there I could say make Google Assistant do this?  Flow:    Ok Google, activate maintenance mode.   (Gassistant reaches out to where it needs to, to trigger these wget commands), which turns on maintenance mode.     Ideas?"
"While driving and not connected to Android auto, but audio connected via Bluetooth, I can say ""OK Google, play music on YouTube music"" and it would be followed with ""ok, playing some music on YouTube music"" now....for whatever reason, in addition to my ""ok google"" being completely ignored most of the time, I get ""ok.

Tried googling this issue but I don't see anyone complaining that the app fails to launch, just complaints that the assistant doesn't respond to commands.

"Like the title says, when using the existing routines for I'm Home or Leaving Home, Google Assistant now asks if you want to change your Home status to ""away"" or ""home"". It asks every single time, and repeats itself over and over if you don't answer it. When you do answer it, it frequently doesn't ""understand"".  How can this be disabled?"
"I've just thinking about it...If I had a Google Home device and my phone in the same room, and I say ""Hey Google"" or ""Okay Google"", both Google home and my phone will respond, or how does it work?"

"I've set up a Google assistant routine that triggers along with my alarm, to play news, turn on the lights etc, but want the media from the news and other sounds to come through my nest mini, rather than my phone. Thanks"
"I have my assistant set to be TYPING default.  But, I also often use voice.  When I start it, I currently have the ""compact"" UI.  My phone is running Android 10, my google app is v [11.43.6.23](https://11.43.6.23)  &amp;#x200B;  What happens is that whenever i start the assistant, they tap the voice button and do an action, i get prompted with a ""quick start guide"" on using voice. As if i started it the 1st time!  The action i say does get done, but the overlay is still there.  &amp;#x200B;  This seems like a rather jarring and big bug, yet it has persisted for at least the last 1.5 years.  &amp;#x200B;  Just wanted to check if I am the only one? Maybe I am the only one who has typing set to default, so nobody ever noticed?  *Processing img crcd3s0qb3c61...*"
"We have the Google Nest Hub and both me and my partner want both our Google accounts on it. We would both like to ask the Hub about events on our Google calendars and for it to recognise the correct voice then show the corresponding calendar, is this possible?  Also, we share a shipping list on Google Keep notes. How can we have it so I can add something to the list and then she can add something to to list as well just by speaking to the Hub."
"So I usually use Google Assistant to call people when I'm cycling but just now I pressed the voice assistant button on my earphones, and instead of hearing the normal assistant tone, my earphones just switched straight to microphone mode.   Then when I said ""call XX"", this robotic voice said ""there are several contacts named XX which one do you want to call"" etc instead of remembering my preferences (it usually just places the call immediately). The audio quality was also really weird, much worse than usual (like headset audio instead of the usual stereo that Google Assistant plays in).  So I tried it a few more times and it happened inconsistently. It sounds a bit like the Google Translate voice, but I'm not sure why that happened/what happened."
"This is my first time using the app (iOS) so I’m  probably being dumb, but I thought with the app a could ask it about a song and then hum/whistle it. But each time when I say ‘what’s this song’ it replies “sorry I don’t have that information”. I did grant it access to the mic and I am logged in with my google account.  Thanks peeps!"
My google slides shows up on my entire screen instead of a internet tab does anybody know how to change/fix this it would help me out.
"Hello, how do I my make sure my Echo Dot says the right choice? ""I read Tara Reid plays a reed instrument. Did you read that too (on reddit?"") 🤪  Thank you!"

"I'm trying to make a routine to open netflix on my Google TV and turn on some lights but whenever I ask to my assistant (on my phone) to ""open netflix on the TV"" the app opens on my phone.

"Q: After setting reminders with a specific time, when the time comes I get notified by both the Google app and the Google assistant app. Any way to fix this?

I received the new UI design previously. Was in the beta version of the google app. Updated to the new version today. And noticed that the Google Assistant UI design has reverted back to the previous one. Anyone else facing the same thing? Currently on version 11.42.12.23.arm64
"Apple recently integrated their Music platform with Google Assistant, so that you can link it as a default provider on a Google account.  Playing music from Apple Music via casting it, or on an Android phone (Assistant or physically navigating to and playing) usually had no issues playing what I wanted to listen to prior to this integration with becoming a selectable default music provider, but if I invoke one of my Google Home Minis to play a song, whether I specify ""on Apple Music"" or not, it plays a remix, acoustic, live, etc. version every time.  If I invoke it via Assistant on my phone, and don't request to play it on any device in my home, it plays the correct song on my device directly.  However, if I invoke via Assistant on any device, phone or speakers, it plays everything but the original song.  I seem to recall YT Music having a similar issue, which normally would have a work-around of just casting the requested media vs invoking Assistant, but I shouldn't have to do this.  Assistant clearly hears me correct, and even in the text response that is simultaneously read aloud via Assistant on my phone, it shows the correct selection, but the playback doesn't match that.  Any ideas?"
"I've had this problem for a few months now, everytime I try to talk with the assistant, it just replies saying ""something went wrong, please try again""  I tried to solve it by:  * formatting the phone * removing my account from the device * using another account * using another language * clearing cache and data   and none of these things solve my issue, so I hope someone can help me with this.  &amp;#x200B;  *P.S- My phone specs (in case it's important)*  *Alcatel 1X 2019 (5059D)*  *2GB RAM*  *Android 8.1*  *16GB Internal Storage (put a 64GB microSD on it)*  *release date: 2018*"
"so all of a sudden one day a couple weeks ago, google assistant started reading out the names of people who sent me messages through facebook messenger. I dont recall if it is doing it for texts, I dont really use text super often, and the app for that one is the google messages app.     it happens whenever I am using my headphones for some reason, but not when I have them unplugged or on bluetooth, why is this happening and how do I stop it?     thanks!"
"Pic : https://imgur.com/gallery/gQVFRLk Model : Pixel 3a XL   It started after the most recent security update. Google assistant doesn't work consistently. Saying ""Hey Google"" or ""Okay Google"" sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Another, as seen in picture linked above, some texts faded.. not that it affects anything.. just a teeny bit annoyed.   On an unrelated note, why can't I switch ""USB controlled by.."" from My Device to Connected Device ? Seems like a really common problem."
"Hi there!  So when I go to sleep, I use the Good Night routine on my nest mini. In the alarm setup, I configured it to run my Good Morning routine when the alarm is stopped.  However, when I tell ""OK Google, stop"" when my alarm starts, it doesn't start the GM routine.  &amp;#x200B;  Am I supposed to say something else?  &amp;#x200B;  I speak French but I guess that if I'm supposed to say something else than ""stop"", I'll just translate."
" A simple command like ""Hey Google, Lower brightness to 10%"" would take up the entire screen. It first pops up at the bottom to listen. But when it executes the command, it takes over my screen and I have to press the back button to go back to what I was doing.  I currently have a OnePlus 6 Running Android 10 I hadn't noticed this before but I just realized how annoying that is because I just got an iPad and Siri doesn't do that. Siri just pops up in the bottom corner, does the task and confirms right in that small corner. I can continue about my task with out extra steps.   This has been mentioned before in an archived thread. Has anything given this further thought?

"I need some more structure in my life and I'm trying to get google assistant to help me out.  What I want to do is after an alarm goes off, to have it specifically say to me ""Hey malenkylizards, it's time to start your workday"" and things like that.  Nothing else.  I added \`say ""it's time to start your workday""\` as a custom action to a routine that starts after I dismiss an alarm and left it at that, but it doesn't really know what to do with that.  Is there an option for something simple like this?"
"So. I'm kinda doing something for the meme and im not sure if it's even possible. Currently I have an ""intruder alert"" routine that makes my google home say: ""The slayer has entered the building"" followed by all of my lights flashing red and then Mick Gordon's Super Gore Nest to play over the speakers.  I would like to take this a step further. Id like to make the routine be triggered automatically by a motion sensor or door sensor. Is this possible? Does anyone know of any security system setups that can initiate google assistant routines?"

"Hi, I use the Rinnai tankless water recirculation skill on google assistant. I created a routine where I can say, ""Hey Google, I need hot water,"" and it starts circulating hot water throughout my house so that I have immediate hot water at all my taps.   The main problem is that only trained household members can call this command. When I walk up to the Nest Hub and try to access the routine by clicking on it, it won't work and it says I must verify my identity by my voice. Is there a way to change this? I want to allow anyone to make that request in my house, like house guests.  Thanks for your help, in advance."
""" hey google what song is this""  Works great, but for goodness sake why can't it give me the option to open the song on Youtube Music... The service that I pay for, and was forced to drop Google Play Music.   It used to do it for GPM. Hell, it even gives me suggestions to open it with Spotify or Deezer (🙄). But why not YTM?   It is all just a damn damn shame man.   It gives me the option to search the song on google assistant, then  brings up hit results for apple music, spotify, etc, but now youtube music. It gives a link half way down the search results page for the song on Youtube. But not youtube music. Yes they are somehow interconnected but it is so cryptic nobody truly knows how."

I have it so the shopping list on my Google Keep notes can be added to from my Google home hub by asking it to add a certain item to the shopping list.

"Over the past year, Google Assistant has been popping reminders on my pixel 3, perhaps 1 every 2 months, that it is time to leave in order to arrive on time at a specific restaurant. When I have legitimate calendar events with addresses, I get these reminders and I expect them. I have nothing on my google calendar for this restaurant. I've been to this restaurant once in the last 10 years. I sometimes get emails from them about promotions, but I regularly delete them upon reading them. If I were to search my gmail inbox right now for the name of this restaurant, there would be nothing. It is a local restaurant, and I know exactly how to get there, so I do not search it up in maps. Why is GA doing this?"

I am able to clear all alarms by saying: ""Turn off all alarms'. However this command refuses to work inside a routine. It just opens up the clock application.   How do you clear alarms generally? Can you clear only a set of alarms or alarms by day etc"
"Hey all, this has been driving me up the wall lately.   &amp;#x200B;  Here's a bit of background. I'm in Japan, and bought a Nest Hub a few months ago.   &amp;#x200B;  I already had a few google home minis (the speaker only kind). Because of google assistant's multi language capabilities, this was very convenient for me and my gf who are living together (she doesn't know much English). When I first set it up, it was in English, which matches my google account language, iphone language, etc. Japanese is 2nd, priority wise.  &amp;#x200B;  However, upon setting up the Nest Hub, although it understands commands in either language, the display itself is in English. I know it supports Japanese, because initially, the setup screen on the device is in Japanese. However, as soon as I get partway through the setup (usually around the time it asks about voice match), the screen goes black, comes back on, and it's in English from there on out.  &amp;#x200B;  I've already changed my iphone's language to Japanese, my google account language to Japanese, reinstalled the google home app, factory resetted the google Nest a dozen times, and even deleted my home within the app. What the hell is going on? How can I change the damn language? Every time i search on the web about it, the topic is the assistant voice. I'm talking about the display!   &amp;#x200B;  PLEASE help!"

"I found out a few weeks ago about tell google assistant to do something in X amount of time (ie turn light off in 5 minutes)  I was thinking about that and decided to try something and to my amazement it worked. You can turn devices on or off at a certain time.  Works; ""Hay google, turn light on at 4:30""  Does not work ""hay google, at 4:30 turn light on""  Now in my bedtime routine I can set a custom command to turn the lights on at the time my alarm clock is set for. Alarm clock is set to 4:30 so I can set command to ""turn lights on at 4:30"""
"Hey there! I'm looking for a solution to a problem on my OnePLus 8 Pro, where saying 'Hey Google' doesn't activate Google Assistant. Now this problem might appear simple or obvious, but I'm afraid it doesn't seem to be. I'm no newby to electronics, I know my way around phones, software and Android, and I know how to look for solutions on the internet. I have quite literally tried everything there is to find about it, in official manuals, by asking the Assistant itself, on Google, Android and OnePlus forums, here on Reddit and a few other forums. The problem is that everything about the Assistant works perfectly fine, I can open it trough long-pressing the lockbutton, a certain swipe gesture, just opening the app and using a hotkey on my headphones. The Assistant opens, it hears my voice perfectly well, it functions as it should and it does what I ask it to do. It's just that saying 'Hey Google' (And 'Ok Google', and both of those in about every pitch, accent and voice I can think of) doesn't do anything. Now as I said I've been looking for solutions for a while now, but nothing seems to work. Restarting the phone, uninstalling and reinstalling both Google Assistant and Google apps, clearing caches, troubleshooting them, asking the Assistant to recalibrate Voice Match (will get back on this later), obviously turning the 'Hey Google' command on and off (and turning it off, restarting phone, turning it on, turning it on and off without restarting phone inbetween, turning off, reinstalling the app and the turning it back on etc. etc. etc.), deleting my complete Google Assistent history multiple times and Voice Match profiles.  I've checked my microphone (it works), checked everything was up to date, checked that all Google apps had the right access' and permissions, went trough almost all the developer options. Nothing works, it's just like the entire function doesn't exist.   Now a lot of possible solutions I've found mention re-training the Google Voice Match. A pecculiar thing is that there seems to be no option what so ever to do so on my phone. The most obvious way for this is going to Google app &gt; More &gt; Settings &gt; Google Assistent &gt; Voice Match. And here the option just doesn't exist (see image), also not when I turn the 'Ok Google' option on and off as described above. I've tried other ways of doing it, including asking the Assistant itself to learn my voice again, but it all leads to this settings page.   I run the following specs:   \- OnePlus 8 Pro IN2023 (Dutch)   \- Android 11   \- Oxygen OS 11.0.2.2.IN11BA   \- Google app version 11.41.10.23.arm64   \- Google Assistant app version 0.1.315561676  I do love the 'Hey Google' detection, and I would love to be able to use it again. I hope I've provided enough information (and haven't overlooked anything obvious), and that maybe someone could be able to help me! Thanks"
"Hey all, basically looking for your support, I've sent feedback to Google, will paste it below. I'm thinking this would be beneficial and if a lot of us request it, maybe it'll get some traction.  &gt;It'd be amazing to have a 'flag clickbait' button, users could raise the issue with news and filter it out if based on a percentage (e. g. if more than 70% of readers reported clickbait, don't show those stories - but we could choose the percentage ourselves).  If these flags were visible to those posting, it may reduce the level to which papers spin the truth, much like having a fake news report button on Facebook reduces the temptation to exaggerate stories there."
"Recently, Google seems to have updated Assistant so that when you hit the microphone option for Google search it asks, over your speaker, ""What do you want to search for?"" I find this redundant, and very annoying. Is there any way to turn off that voice prompt? It was not readily apparent in the settings."
"I have the Google search bar widget on my home screen.  Me: Click the mic icon.     Google (display): ""Listening...""     Me: ""text Joe""   Google (speaking): ""Text Joe Bloggs Oklahoma, what's the message?""  Uh, wat?  Where did Oklahoma come from?  Oklahoma is NOT on the contact card.     This also happens with *every* *single* contact.  What's more, this is happening on my Dad's phone too.  Their phone.  Their Google account.  My account is not on his phone.  He said it began happening on his phone last week.   Oh, and I'm in the UK.  Never been to Oklahoma in my life.  Don't know anyone in Oklahoma either."
"When you ask Google to call Santa Claus now, there's a cute routine that comes on.  An elf picks up the phone and then transfers you to Santa.

"I'm ready to pull my hair out. For years my IFTTT applet to add stuff to my shopping list via todoist has worked great. My kids can add to it without voicematch, I have a widget for it on my home screen, it's great. Since last week, when I say ""Hey google, add whatever to my shopping list"" it now defaults to my Google lists. It added a list and even after trying to delete lists, change the name, whatever, it will not listen to my IFTTT parameters. So, I begrudging deleted my IFTTT applet and made peace with using Google notes instead (or rather a third party app available through it)  Only now, I can use it fine, but my kids adding items still route through IFTTT and todoist, despite having deleted the applet. I've tried every solution I can think of, and nothing seems to clear the applet from Google Assistant, nor did trying to add to voicematch to my daughters Gmail so I could setup access to the stupid defaulted Google list. I don't want to use Google lists at all - is there any way to disable this feature from being used when adding something to the shopping list? Is the magic word ""list""? Will we just have to come up with something else?  This is so, so stupid."

"I'm using a Pixel 4a, fully updated.  1) I don't get the full experience unless I'm navigating. If I'm just driving around in my own town, I can launch the driving mode, but unless it's taking me to a destination, I don't get the assistance with messages, or the convenient media controls. 2) I can't change the apps available to launch for media. I don't use YouTube Music, and all my audio books are in Audible. I can launch Spotify from driving mode, but I have to exit and launch Audible separately. 3) Messaging is quirky. Sometimes, a text message comes in and it helps fails to read it. It pretends to, and nothing comes out, it just asks if I want to reply. But if I go to Messages, I can see the message clearly. 4) Facebook Messenger never works right. It will reliably read the message, but always asks me if I want to repeat. I can't reply to them with driving mode.  Is it just me, or does anybody else see weird things like this? I'll try driving mode in a month or two, maybe it will work better later."
"I enabled Assistant Driving Mode on my Pixel 5 as soon as it was available. And I've noticed that whenever I begin navigation in Google Maps, Driving Mode starts up and (understandably) puts my phone in Do Not Disturb (DND) mode.  However, when I exit navigation, DND doesn't end. And perhaps worse, Driving Mode changes my DND settings to hide notifications from the status bar and pull-down menu entirely. I'm okay with that while driving... but not for all DND situations.  Has anyone else experienced this?"

"If you don't know what this is, google assistant can now do things like: ""Turn off the lights in 20 minutes""  Without having to set a routine!   This (I haven't tested) should be able to work inside of the custom routines, too!   For example, I plan on having a routine turn my tv on in the morning and tune to the news / weather while I get ready for work, 20 minutes after that I want it to turn off the TV  This feature was supposed to arrive 'Early 2020' but this is the first I've seen!"

And when she does i just loops her back to thr same page. Also she cant turn on Ok Google.  Is it because of the Huawei ban or something else?"
Hello everyone ! I have had this new UI from google assistant and then i have changed my ROM and i still had it like 2-3 times of reset but then i just lost it and I don't have it anymore and i was wondering is there a way to get it ? Also i was wondering if there way a way to get new Gboard UI too ?
"This is mostly a rant but eh.      I use my assistant on my Pixel 4xl constantly. Voice commands and routines are really useful for day to day things including managing my schedule and operating home automation. I also use it while driving for directions and music.      So I get up in the morning, use my phone some, grab my coffee, go to my desk and put my phone down. Then I check my emails and start using the assistant.    ""Hey Google set an alarm for nine thirty""   - 'Sure, but first you will need to unlock your device.      My phone is literally sat on the desk next to me. It can see me and usually it wakes up and face unlock immediately unlocks it. But then the assistant does nothing. Just hangs out waiting for a command. This morning it told me to unlock my phone while already unlocked and displaying the home screen as I'd just put it down.     Then there's driving. Hands free and safe right? Nope. Can't play any music without digging out my phone and unlocking it. Can't change my route without first taking my eyes off the road.       Both my home wifi &amp; car BT are marked as trusted but we all know that has never worked correctly for Android. Assistant used to work really well and felt pretty transparent. Now I feel like every time I use it that becomes a task in itself. I have to say the command, unlock the phone, repeat the command, and then check that it did what I actually wanted. Such a disappointment.      In comparison my Google Home works really well but doesn't sync anything to my phone. Any alarms or appointments I set are tied to that device which is also fairly useless.     Anyone have any tips (other than 'buy an iPhone') or similar experiences?"

"Hello,  A few days ago google assistant updated and started a new feature in which the assistant is activated when the action button on my headphones is pressed. The thing is, that now all the usual functions (such as stop/play, end call, etc.) don't work anymore because it always acts as if I requested the assistant. Is there a way to turn this function off and have google assistant triggered by her usual ways? I tried looking through all of its settings but didn't find anything related.  (Also, a few weeks back, the ""ding"" that used to play when the assistant was called had stopped unless I'm with my headphones. Does anyone know who to bring it back? It's my main tool for finding my phone)"
"I have a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and a Google Home Mini in my kitchen. My Xbox One is also hooked up to my Google Home app and Assistant is enabled on all three devices. Ever since I upgraded my phone from an S8 Plus, nearly every single request I run through my phone is met with ""Something Went Wrong...Etc...""   Even simple tasks like making a phone call can no longer be processed. I have tried everything I can find in the support pages. I uninstalled, updated, and reinstalled both the beta and non beta versions of Google app, I have enabled and disabled nearly every single pertinent setting inside the assistant settings.   I have figured out that I can't use voice activation on my phone if I am in range of my Google Home Mini. It always gets routed through the speaker which is very annoying for common tasks. I have to manually activate the assistant on my phone in order to use its assistant, which sort of defeats the purpose of voice activation.   All that aside, I only want my assistant to work as intended. What can I do to fix this? As of right now, its nearly completely useless to me. I can't even make a call or send a text anymore, let alone anything more complicated. It doesn't seem to matter if I'm on WiFi or cellular data, or any other variable I could think of to test. I just seem to get A LOT of ""Something went wrong, please try again.""  Thanks everyone."
"So, I was watching YouTube on my Xbox one, and it suddenly got disconnected from my account. I tried about five times with different codes to login in at YouTube.com/activate(BTW I use a iPhone 8), I went to google and tried to solve it by searching the problem up, but I then couldn’t use google (the app), so I went to chrome, and tried that, I then get the error code “505”, so I can only go to safari and search what the error code means, it tells me to clear the app cache on my phone, I’ve done that twice now and still can’t use my google account on any device, any website, nor any app.  P.S. I can use every app fine once I log out."
"Between 6 and 7 am this morning, all devices (Home, Home Hub, Wear watch, smart speakers, Pixel 5) only respond with something went wrong or there was a glitch. Internet speeds are fine connection is stable. It occurs over 5G or Wi-Fi.  Anyone else having this problem this morning?"
"Here is what I'm looking for a Home compatible podcast app/site that I can just start from my Google Nest Mini without having to touch my phone in the other room. It needs to have the following:  * Smart Playlist (When a new episode of a subscribed podcast is available it auto adds it to the playlist) * Ability to play the Playlist from the Mini * Smartphone app that supports downloading of the podcast so I can play them on the go without using data) * Played/Progress Status between the 2. * Ability to mark episodes as played en mass as one of the ones I listed to has more than 300 episodes and I have no desire to go mark each one individually.  I currently use Pocket Casts, but it's a pain to have to go into the other room and start it on my phone then cast it to the Mini. (Please don't recommend the Google Podcasts app as it has none of the above, and I don't believe Spotify does either)"

"Hey!  I recently got a Pixel stand for Pixel 5, as well as the new Lenovo Smart Tab M10 HD.  I'm finding that for either device, when I put the device in the dock the first screen always is the lock screen. Eventually the Ambient mode kicks in and shows recent photos/highlights based on what I selected in the Ambient mode configuration.  What I'm finding though is after 1-2 hours it just goes back to the lock screen with the digital clock and my notifications. I would like it to stay on the photo frame (similar to the Google Nest Hub).  Is there some setting or something I need to disable/enable to keep the lock screen from popping back on?"
"I'm just curious. I love google assistant and think it's much more intelligent than Apple's siri. But if Apple's SoC has more computing power than google's SoC, why is siri lacking in intelligence. For example, the new A14 bionic chip has 16 cores and google, who uses snapdragon, only has 8. I tried researching into this but I couldn't find anything. Basically I'm just wondering why assistant is more useful when it's hardware doesn't match up with siri who has better hardware.   Let me know if I explained it good, I tried my best to articulate my question/problem."

"Is there any way to out Google into like a training mode? Like where I can say a bunch of stuff and have it learn my accent better?  I know back in ye Olde days of voice to text stiff in the 90's and early 00's you had to train software to your voice, and the more you used it, the better it got with your accent as you painstakingly corrected it over and over, eventually you had to correct it less and less.  For reference, I speak kind of like Steve Irwin with a fairly broad Australian Accent, not quite as broad as Steve Irwin, but broad.  Like if I say ""Mate"" I accentuate the A, causing Google to add a bunch of additional ""A's"" to the word, so it puts out ""Maaaate"" and then strangely, changes it to something bizarre like ""Massage"" which is certainly not what I said.  But obviously Maaate isn't a word, so I think at that point autocorrect kicks in and tries to find a word, so maybe voice to text does its job, but it's autocorrect screwing me?  Further, Google has issues when I send messages like ""What's going on?"" Which it will reduce to just jibberish ""Was car done?"" or ""Was Conan on?""  Or if I'm sending someone a message, it just can't figure out ""G'Day"", possibly one of the most common greetings in Australia. Generally it just calls stuff ""Gay""  So inevitably, I end up trying to correct a message that's bizarrely gone from:   &gt;G'day mate, what's going on?  To  &gt;Gay massage was Conan on?  Also I inadvertently say things like ""Yeah Nah"" or ""Nah Yeah"" when Google asks me a yes or no question, I mean, to us the meaning of those phrases is obvious, but Google does random shit, generally the opposite of what I want.  So like, if it asks me if I want to reply to a message and I say ""Yeah Nah"" it replies with ""What do you want to say?""  That or I guess Aussies are like the Welsh, Scottish, Irish, or basically any English speaking nation that's not the USA, and we'll just have issues for a long time until Google's AI finally figures us out."
"So in the past I've had issues with Assistant not always doing what I tell it to do even if it properly recognizes all of the words I just said (mainly in regards to playing specific songs/albums, detailed a little more in a post I made here some [ten months back](https://redd.it/f0vowj) that unfortunately no one was able to answer).  In trying to find a way to circumvent this, I considered setting up routines so I can give Assistant custom commands that will make it queue up the songs I play most often or that it seems to have the most trouble playing via normal voice command.  The problem I noticed with my idea is that setting up custom routines seems *too* simple. Unless if I'm missing something, the only things I seem to be able to make a custom routine do are either recognize one command as another, or choose from a list of ""popular"" actions. What I'd rather be able to do is, on creating a routine, tell it to open my music app and and selecting the song/album that I want that command to play.  For example, let's say I want to tell Assistant ""activate self destruct sequence"" and have it recognize that command to mean I want it to play let's say the entirety of the Beatles' Abbey Road album which for argument's sake would be stored on my phone. I'd like to be able to set up the command to, in order, open the preferred music app, select the album, and play all. Instead, it seems I would have to more manually tell it to recognize the words ""activate self destruct sequence"" as ""play Abbey Road on &lt;app&gt;"", which seems to defeat the purpose of what I want to do with routines, except maybe shorten some commands in practice.  Is there any roundabout way of setting custom routines up to do what I want it to do or am I SOL and forced into something that is more or less equivalent to telling a programming language that 3 = 4?"
"Does anyone  know how to make Google assistant use a start up sound again. With the new updates the google app is a nightmare to figure out and the start up sound no longer happens when I say ""Hey google"".

New to Google Assistant and I’ve looked around but I couldn’t find anything anywhere. So my questions is how to I give Google Assistant the command to shuffle music from Spotify? I’ve already got a command that plays my playlist but it just can’t figure out how to shuffle. I’ve tried “Play &lt;playlist name&gt; playlist on shuffle” and “Play &lt;playlist name&gt; playlist” than “Shuffle” but neither seems to work and for the life of my I can’t figure it out...
"It's said that you can use an Assistant routine on an android phone to do something like set the phone volume to zero at a specific time.  I've created such a routine and when it runs at the specified time, I get a message that says it failed. It suggests I add a speaker to the routine (which doesn't make any sense). I have tried adding one but it still fails.  It's most interesting to me that I can now add a button on my home screen to run the routine. When I do that... It friggin works!  Another example of a half-baked feature that shouldn't have passed QA. Assistant is great at some things, but it is SO terrible at a lot."

"So I asked Google Assistant earlier to set an alarm to let me know when it was 8am in the UK  Pretty simple question I thought, as the UK is all on one time zone.  However what it actually did was set an alarm for 8am, in my time zone, with a note that would tell me ""In the UK""  For comparison I'm in Australia, Brisbane, so I take my current time and subtract 10 hours.  So my bad math means at 6PM QLD time is 8AM UK time  \*Checks Google\* Yep, looks about right.  But without having to check and manually calculated it, I thought that would be a thing that had already been solved.  A more relevant thing I would want to normally set a reminder for would be Brisbane to Sydney time, because for half the year, Sydney has decided they want to be on GMT+11 instead of GMT+10  So if I need to talk or interact with someone in Sydney, I'd set a time for Sydney at 5PM and I'd get an alarm for Brisbane 4PM  Maybe I'm just asking Google wrong, but I also tried asking it to set an Alarm for Greenwich Mean Time 8am and it decided I wanted an alarm for tomorrow morning (my time) at 8am, with the note of ""Greenwich Mean Time""  So how exactly do I set an alarm for Google to tell me the time in another time zone?  I mean, I can already ask Google to tell me the time in these locations, like if I Ask ""What will the time be in the United Kingdom when it is 6pm here"" so gives me 8AM Friday Morning.  However when I ask it the Inverse, ergo, ""What will be the time in my location when it is 8am in the United Kingdom on Friday"" it will instead use my time, assume I'm asking about 8am in my timezone, and then give me 10pm Thursday night as the answer.  So it gets the time difference, but there seems to be no clear way to look it up correctly. There has to be some manual guesswork involved.  So instead of knowing when my show is about to drop on Netflix, instead I have to camp my arse on the couch and wait, rather than be reminded, or manually set an alarm after I manually calculate the time difference.  Am I just structuring my questions entirely wrong?"

"I had no problems with Siri for many years. If I ever asked for a notification at a time/day it would give it to me at the time I asked with exactly what I said.     Take this reminder for instance: ""Remind me at 2pm tomorrow that I have a phone consult at 3pm"".  With Google Assistant I have the following problems:  1. It can put the notification at the time of the event, not the time I asked to be notified, i.e. at 3pm I will get a notification that reads ""Phone consult"". Sometimes it does exactly as I ask and at 2pm I'll get a notification saying ""I have a phone consult at 3pm"". Why would it respond differently, causing harm to the user despite speech to text saying the exact same thing. 2. Despite knowing I said 'tomorrow' it can put this notification every. single. day. unless I manually remove it. I have to look after every reminder I put in that I don't get repeating notifications despite the speech to text being exactly what I asked. 3. Sometimes I'll get a notification saying ""phone consult"" when it clearly read my speech perfectly. Sometimes it will say ""phone consult at 3pm"" at 2pm like I asked. Sometimes it will just say ""phone consult"" at 3 when I asked for it at 2pm.  Bear in mind Google Assistant has no problems with what I say, it reads them perfectly it's just.. inconsistent to the point of causing harm rather than a feature."

"I got my new LG Stylo 6 1 week ago and I love it. But I have had this problem for 4 days where Google is suddenly turning on Google Assistant for no reason. They told me its because it hears a sound that it thinks is ""Hey google"" but I was in a completely silent room and I wasn't playing a video. It changes my volume and opens assistant every 5 - 7 seconds . It is agony to type this. I tried to turn it off but when I open assistant options, it gives me the asking screen again. Making it impossible to do it fast enough. It also completely shut down my phone one time because it couldnt access my files. Any questions write them in the comments."
"My nest hub is about to arrive, do you have any tips for me?  Also I read that youtube doesn't attach to your Google account and the recommended videos - after watching a youtube video on the nest hub - aren't based on the user but on the video. Is this true?"
"I accidentally manually cast a YT music song to my firetv in the list of devices and interestingly this worked incredibly well. My TV turned on and the firestick started playing my song (from my personal library) on the YouTube app.  Wondering whether I can utilise this further. Is it possible to ask Assistant to cast music of TV shows to Fire TV in a similar way? Trying it out just now, Google doesn't recognise the name of my fire TV despite it being in the casting list, and I can't add it to my Google home."
"This morning after I restarted my phone, my routines are not finishing completely. They're only partly finishing. When I go to routines, everything looks okay. Can't figure out what's going on. Anyone else having this problem?"
"Hello, I'm trying to configure the Google Home Mini for my mum. She is disabled and cannot pronounce words clearly, she can only make some high pitch non-lingual sounds.   Can Google Home Mini or Google Assistant software recognize custom sounds (non human language) and take them as commands?  If it's not a native feature of Google Home Mini, are there some ways to workaround for achieving that?  Thanks a lot in advances!"
"I have a Google hub and several minis around my house.  I will ask them to play something on Pandora and all my devices will usually need to be asked multiple times.  I will always get a response ""playing such-and-such on Pandora""... but then nothing happens.  If I ask a second or third time it will usually work. Sometimes my Google Hub will display the Pandora icon but will not actually fully load the app, other times nothing happens at all.  I have unplugged the devices and re-linked Pandora to the account.  An internet search showed some posts complaining about the same thing from some years ago, but I didn't see an answer.  Anyone else still experiencing this?"

"'Shuffle x on all speakers' shuffles a Halloween rock song, followed by pop music, where it used to shuffle rock genre, when x = 'rock music'.  When x = 'jazz , it shuffle music by Ariana Grande, Lewis Capaldi, etc. and also plays ambient music of rain 😂  This morning, when x = 'rock music on Spotify', it shuffles a bunch of songs by the Bee Gees, so that has changed from the Halloween music   When x = 'my music on Spotify', this used to work, but now it thinks I'm asking it to shuffle music that is playing, and tells me that nothing is playing, if there isn't. 'My music' without 'on Spotify' has never worked properly and shuffles music I've never heard of, now all commands are broken, and I can only say, 'shuffle my library on all speakers'  Basically, you get the picture. When saying these commands without 'all speakers' some of them work properly. Other times, I have to say 'on Spotify', but that has broken this morning for rock music, which plays the Bee Gees  Is there something stick, or something that needs to be reset?"

"iOS has a nice shortcuts app to automate things.  I automate some of my exercise routines when I start and end.  Is there any way to get Google assistant to trigger/run an iOS Shortcut.  So currently I say ""hey google I'm working out"" to my mini and it does a number of routines for me.  I would like for it to also run my customized iOS Shortcut that's on my iPad."
Probably a simple answer but I can't find it through a simple search. I'm using Google maps through Android auto and simply want the assistant to not call out my ever turn (mostly because it's obnoxious when I'm on the phone and speaks over me). But I don't want to completely disable it either of course. Where can I find this setting? Thanks all.
Title is a bit dramatic but it's really a small problem(sorry btw if this isn't the place to post about this stuff). Anyway I was wondering if anyone knows how to make it so Google assistant won't open other apps when you ask it to do things. I'm mostly asking for Spotify. I want GA to be able to play music/a playlist without forcing me to go to Spotify. Thanks!
"Long story short, is it possible to create ONE ROUTINE that if:  a) a lightbulb is on the command will turn the bulb off  b) and if the lightbulb is off the command will turn the bulb on  I know you can have two separate Lights Off and Lights On, but id love one singular ‘Flip the lightswitch’"
With mt previous phone (Oneplus 5) I was able to say Ok Google when the screen was on and locked and was disabled with the screen off save battery life. With my new phone (Asus Zenfone 7 Pro) I can't. I have to activate the Hey Google command which works with the screen locked and I don't want to. I want the assistant to works only when the screen is on (locked or unlocked) but not when the screen is off. How can I fix it?
I've seen ways to do it but I don't know if they actually work.
"Hi!  I recently replaced my older LG tv with a Vizio. The LG had both sleep and wake timers, so I could tell it to turn off at 2am and turn on to a specific channel at 8am. The Vizio has a sleep countdown timer, so I can tell it to turn off after XX minutes, but not to turn on/off at specific times.     Both the TV and my TiVo Stream have Chromecast built in and I'm trying to figure out if I can set-up a routine to mimic the same thing. Anyone have any idea? The most I currently use Google Assistant for is getting directions and changing music in my car."
I use google assistant to voice-log events that get sent into a google calendar. Is there a way to log events with google calendar that are logged as a single moment in time rather than as a timespan. So far I have only found a way to reduce the default google calendar entry length to be a 15 minute time period that has a start time and a stop time. I only want the entry to be a single moment in time.
"I just made the switch to a Note 20 from my iPhone 8 plus. Loving the android experience so far but there is one thing I'm trying to figure out. I could set reminders with Siri to have it remind me of things when I got in the car,  usually to record my mileage since it's a company vehicle. It would trigger the reminder when the phone connected to my car's Bluetooth. Is there a way to make Google Assistant (or Bixby) do this?"
I have been using Google assistant on my Android phone for years and years I notice a new update to the Google assistant app which is coincided with me resetting my phone and I can no longer get Google assistant working I have looked at the settings and and there are now hundreds but none on which actually switch the assistant on or off
I really want to use it handsfree while my phone is locked and screen is off.
I know Google limited GA functionality a while ago but this has been working for me up until about a week or two ago. If my phone is unlocked that command works no problem so it sounds like it's a limitation brought on by the GA security change but that was over a year ago. Is there another explanation or is my question already answered?

"I was at a doctors appointment the other day and my doctor asked me a question. Ever since then, my google assistant tells me every night ""Don't forget to (do what doctor said) before bed."" I never set any reminders, I never even use google assistant. I cant find any reminders or voice notes or anything on this. 1) How did this even happen? And 2) How do i make it stop?"

"I asked the assistant to play Skrillex on spotify several times and each time it says it will play Skrillex, but instead it plays Sonny Moore - All By Myself. Am I the only one having this problem? I have never had a similar problem with mysic playback unless the assistant mishears me."
"I use this feature a lot, for safety reasons while driving, I'm placing a call through google assistant, and it used to work really well and simple, but now, it tells me I'll have to unlock my phone first (which is set to stay unlocked via smart lock when connected to car btw, but it used to work without that too) which defeats the entire point of google assistant if I have to reach for my phone I'll make a call manually pressing 2 buttons. Is there a way to fix this?     Also, when phone is not connected to car's bluetooth, it works as intended, not asking for my fingerprint."

"I currently have a Harman kardon invoke in my kitchen area that I absolutely love regarding sound quality. However, Microsoft is discontinuing Cortana so it's going to become nothing more than a basic Bluetooth speaker in the beginning of next year. I'm looking to replace it with another speaker and I'd prefer to have Google Assistant over alexa. I was wondering if anyone here could recommend a few smart speakers that offer 360° sound that also sound really good, similar to the invoke?"
"I remember once I launched assistant and it had the rainbow bar that they've shown as part of assistant 2.0, but now I have the old Assistant UI yet when I open assistant settings I see a Continued Conversation option. The assistant is not nearly as fast as assistant 2.0 in the demos. I am using a Xiaomi Redmi Note 9S, is it just me or is assistant 2.0 still exclusive to the Pixel?"

" Hi r/googleassistant,     This is a lightly edited version of a thread I posted to Google Assistant Help on 10/17/20. Today is 10/26/29 and I've had no replies in that forum. I'm posting here on reddit hoping that someone may have an answer, My question and circumstances are as follows:   On Android phone, how do you make the Google Assistant's new ""Say"" command output be directed to the phone's **internal** speaker? When I create the routine, the ""choose a speaker"" drop down is just grayed out. That's probably because there are **no standalone** Google/Amazon/Apple or other brand standalone smart speakers at this location.   I'm currently doing this ""Say"" functionality at specific times of the day with Tasker. The procedure is a bit more complicated and may be beyond the technical reach of many users. By the way, it took me 15 minutes to figure out that Google Assistant's Help's choice of the single word ""speaker"" meant an external smart speaker.  Thanks for your help, comments or suggestions.  Regards . . ."
"I'm going to try to summarize the issue as succinctly as I can;  - in the car I connect my phone to bluetooth so I can make/receive calls.    - when driving, I have radio (sirius xm) playing.    - when I talk to google assistant, it is responding to me through the Bluetooth connection (I think, because it is silent but if I look at the screen I can see GA is interacting).    - because my car stereo is on radio and not bluetooth, I can't hear anything.   what I'm looking to figure out:  how do I get Google assistant to respond to me through the phone speaker rather than the active bluetooth connection?  I'm looking for any creative solution if it will help me listen to car stereo while interacting with GA at the same time (short of buying a new car of course).  Thanks!"
"Ok so after s bit of not using the assistant I noticed it would t pop up when I held down my home button or say ""hey Google"". I also noticed that in Google maps, the voice button doesn't work so I can't enter addressed with NY voice manually in maps. I tested voice function in other apps like Facebook messenger and discord and confirmed that my phone still can record voice and the problem is s Google stuff. I noticed that the assistant app wasn't there anymore either and when I manually downloaded it back to my phone it wouldn't work. Amazon Alexa works but Google assistant doesn't it. They used to both work fine though."
Does anyone know what is really shared in a family group sharing plan?

"I live in Israel and Hebrew does not supported. Tho a few days ago i was like ""hey lets activate ga and see how is it"" surprisingly it worked, but in English, which is totally ok for me. Today my dad wanted me to turn on ga on his phone and it did not work. So i dont know why, i disabled the ga on my phone to see whats the difference between mine and his phone but now MINE DOESN'T TURN ON AGAIN. My phone was on Hebrew and ga was on English and everything was ok but now i need to make the phone in English to be able to make ga turn on again. Why did this work then but now its not??"
"Gonna ask again, hoping someone found a workaround. When you ask Google Assistant, ""What's on my calendar today?"" you get the response, ""Sorry, I can't find anything on your calendar today."" Even though my Google Calendar is chock full of events from Outlook Sync. So they aren't native Google Calendar events, but rather events that are appearing in my Google Calendar because I have it synced with my Outlook account.   Back before Google screwed this up, you could ask your assistant and it would read out Outlook events. But that was when I had a Calendar app that was not Google Calendar, it was first the Moto Calendar and then the LG Calendar. Both were skinned versions of Google Calendar, I believe.   I am wondering if anyone knows of a permanent workaround for this that doesn't require importing the events into Google Calendar? Anyone tried using another Calendar app and disabling Google Calendar?"
"I have gone under the assistant settings -&gt; notifications -&gt; tips &amp; tricks and turned it off. Yet I still get ""Protips"" with about half of my requests. Like this morning.  Alarm goes off at 6 am Me: ""Stop"" Me: ""Hey google, set an alarm for 6:30"" GA: ""ok alarm set for 6:30 and here is a pro tip. If you ever lose your phone, just ask and I can find it""  This is useless, annoying, and I am just trying to sleep. I have turned this feature off.  How can I make these stop?"

"It was one of my favorite uses of the Google Assistant, but lately I asked to add stuff to the list and it adds non sense, like I asked to add Toast Bread to the list and the response was ""done I added GA PA to your list"" WTF is GA PA, why it's confusing.  In order to check if it was me or the microphone, I installed Alexa and asked the same thing, no issues with Alexa."
I picked up a new phone the other day (Poco F2 Pro) and when i say OK Google it was vibrating i tried removing vibration access to Assistant it kept doing it  Thinking there would be an option to change this i looked for hours  It turns out the only way you can disable it atm is to install Android Accessibility Suite then either enable Accessibility menu or Switch Access then you get the beep when you say OK Google instead of vibrate  Here's an idea have a setting people can change OK Google beep/vibrate/none  quite why i have to have another app installed for beep to work is boggling
"There's this feature that allows google assistant to read the screen for you, but it simply isn't working on my pixel 4.  Every time I tell her what's on my screen, she just says she need permission to my screen. The feature doesn't work even though I have given permission in settings.  Is anyone else having the same issue?"
"I have a Redmi Note 9S and I can't get Google's assistant to open by voice, only when pressing the home button or by opening the Google Assistant's app. I got this phone this week and it does not recognize when I say ""OK Google"" or something alike, even though Voice Match is on.   When I looked online tutorials I saw I was missing the option of retraining voice model.  I tried every troubleshooting, clearing Google's app cache, updating the app, and changing the language to English US everywhere and nothing works.  The only thing I see wrong is when I click on add devices in the Voice Match menu it always says connection error, try again later. Other than that it should be working  For context: Smartphone: Redmi Note 9S MIUI: 11.0.4 Google app: version 11.32    If someone has any idea on how to make the voice model option appear, I'd be much appreciated"
"So I've recently started integrating Google Assistant into my daily routine. I'm fact, I've added routines for when I leave for work and everything. Everything works great except for when I try to set a location based reminder for when I get to work.   I have all the permissions enabled. My work address is saved. I always get a ""It looks like I don't have your work address, let's fix that."" I've tried the option of hitting the ""edit work"" and telling the assistant what my work address is. She confirms it and the reminder is saved. The next time I go to set a work location reminder, she forgets the location.   I'm close to pulling my hair out because the main reason I want to integrate it is because I have a condition that causes short term memory loss. The assistant has been great for a ton of other reminders and lists, but this is REALLY what I need it for. Thanks in advance for any advice."
"It was working fine before the quarantine few months ago, but stopped working when I got back to work. I have reinstalled google maps and enable all the notification and related settings.

"I live in Italy and hear a lot of the new features that google add to assistant doesn’t work and they say that soon will be implemented the other language, but when? There is a website or something like that announce when they will be available?"
"A recent update (within the last month or two) has made my voice activated google assistant completely unusable. I pretty much only ever use it to set timers and now it hears ""set a timer for 6 minutes"" as random shit like ""shut up Sam wilson"". It doesn't even work if I speak real slow.   The wierdest part though is that if I press the assistant button (lg g8), it seems to work fine.  Anyone know what the hell they did to this thing and how to fix it or revert it?  Thank you"
"Hey guys, I can make reminders by saying hey google remind me to whatever. But when the time comes along I get no noise notification NOTHING."
"Hey Google, text Jennifer Smith.  ""You have several people named Jennifer in your contacts list. Tell me which one. Try saying the full name.""  Jennifer Smith  ""Okay.

"I often work with both devices in front of me. How do I choose which device responds to my GA command/question?  Often I say Ok Google open Chrome, hoping that Chrome will open on the Tab. However, the Note 8 responds. Can I use one trigger phrase for one device and another phrase for the other?  If so, how do I do that? For example, Ok Zelda for the Tab to respond and Ok Google for the phone. I often have both hand in use and can't open GA in any other way than voice.  Is there another solution I could use?   Thanks in advance."
Can an alarm be set on a nest mini then have the alarm or an alert notify me on my phone?
"I got a Pixel 4 a couple days ago, and I was trying out some tricks with the assistant. To my surprise, she didn't flirt with me when I told her to kiss me.  I remember this working on my old phone (Pixel 2) back in the days. Also, this was a well-known trick. Why won't the assistant flirt anymore?"

"While Google Assistant shows that it is linked to Wiz, it does not execute any commands . I ask it to Turn off lights (Wiz bulbs set up) , it says one or more devices not set up.   Whereas from the Google Home app I see it it connected and saying the same command - Turn off lights , it executes and turns off the lights .   Essentially I cannot execute any command to control my wiz lights from the assistant but can do it from the Home app.   Any solutions ?   BTW , it was all working fine till Wiz updated their app."
My Google assistant is broke. I am really sad. Now when I ask it something for instance a search it only shows this results and does not speak out a summary anymore. So now when I'm driving I have to look at my screen and I might die. Please help me get Google to talk to me again.
"Like the title says, I've noticed it both with Google assistant and even just with Google voice search. When I have Bluetooth earbuds connected, Google will still only respond to audio picked up by my phones microphone and never through the Bluetooth mic.  I've tested and made sure the Bluetooth mic is working fine. And every other app on the phone immediately registers the Bluetooth earbuds for input and output, but for whatever reason Google only ever responds to the phones mic"
"I've got an LG G8 with Google Assistant built in. I was excited to try out the Google routines with the assistant as I am working from home and would love a reminder to take breaks/my lunch/stretch/etc without downloading another app or just setting a bunch of alarms.   The morning routine seems to work fine as I have to prompt it with ""good morning"" which triggers all of the different actions (say ""xyz,"" tell me the weather/my calendar, play music), apart from that I've never gotten amazon music to automatically start playing using Google assistant...   For the workday routine I used the basic suggestions with a few modifications, but the Assistant isn't actually doing the things I've asked (telling me the time, saying ""take a 10 minute break/go grab a glass of water/take a few minutes to stretch""). It just creates a notification and uses the standard notification sound. I experimented with having my screen locked and unlocked, even when unlocked it only created a notification. I don't have a smart home/speaker device - is that the problem? Can I only make use of this with an external device - when I click on the Play Assistant Responses with bar, nothing (not even just my phone) pops up. I just want it to use my phone but that doesn't seem to be an option. I hope I'm wrong!  TIA!"
"Is anyone aware of any products which might exist where it's quite literally just a button.  maybe the size of a Tile?   I've been hunting around, and the closest I've found is VoiceMojo on Kickstarter, which:   a) I don't want to wear around my neck   b) looks a little clumsy  Basically, I'm getting a little tired of ""hey Google"" before everything, and I've taken to walking around with the new Chromecast with GoogleTV remote in my pocket so that I can use the voice feature on it... It works well, but it's a TV remote at the end of the day.  I can do a similar thing with my Bose headphones, but I don't walk around the house wearing them all day, and they need to connect to my phone.  I know this is possible on WearOS watches too, but I've not worn a watch for years (since they put clocks on phones)  Essentially, I'm looking for something similar to the assistant button on the GoogleTV remote, but smaller.. say like (oh, please God, a Starfleet pin).  I'm just wondering if anything like that is knocking about yet that I've not found, or is it too early?"
"I read it can't for security reasons, but it's not like it even unlocks the phone. I just want it to work like Siri where I don't have to turn on the screen first. Heck even the android phones that do support this feature don't unlock the phone, they just work the same way Siri does. I don't see the security breach in searching using voice while the screen is off because IT WORKS EVEN ON LOCK SCREEN ANYWAYS. Just not when the screen is off. Is this a hardware incapability or what?"
"I've been using Google assistant many times a day for months flawlessly, But the last few days it has been so dumb. If I say something like ""send feedback"" it would receive ""bend kneecap"" I speak as clearly as possible and it still doesn't work. Idk if it's my phone's mics but something is wrong. Is anyone else having this Issue?"
You can whisper close to mic and Google Assistant will listen. Handy in library or late night when you don't want to wake up someone.
"I use a wifi switch to control a garage door which has been working great until I got a car with Android Auto. The issue is I have a routine setup for the phrase ""open the garage door,"" which replaces the standard phrase of ""turn garage up on"". Routines unfortunately don't work in Android Auto, and it's much less natural to use the standard phrase.   Is there a way to add a custom phrase to a task in Google Assistant without routines?   Thanks!"
"I'm guessing this is because of the ""you can talk to it like a person"" aspect of the Google assistant, since most people ascociate MTV unplugged with nirvana.

The windows Spotify app is hell to use, and I don't want to go there to select my playlist because it can sometimes take several minutes to open. It's so much easier just to say ""hey Google, play ________"". I'd really appreciate some help solving this issue because I can't seem to get it to play that playlist no matter what I try.   Cheers and thanks in advance to anyone who can offer help :)"
"For the first time ever I'm trying out the whole add to shopping list feature on my phone.   But I've run into an issue.  After I tell it to add something, and then actually look at my shopping list it opens the web browser, and pulls up shoppinglist.google.com.   Then when I click on an individual item, it pulls up a box that lets me add notes about the product, and has a show product button at the bottom.  Here is my issue, after I do that, it starts searching for stuff in british pounds currency 💷, and shows products from the UK, even though I live in the state of Missouri in USA.  Why isn't it searching for American things, with american currency, rather than items in the UK, with British pound currency?  I've looked everywhere and googled my fingers to the bone trying to find out how to change this, but can't find anything.  Anyone that can help?"
"I've set up a bunch of Family Bells for my work from home and my kids remote learning, but occasionally there are days off or holidays, like today, where they don't have school and we don't want to have the bells going off throughout the day.

i know google can tell me estimated commute times at a certain time or from a phrase but i wanted to know if its possible to have it tell me when i l need to leave home by to make it to work by x time. i know google maps can do this but a daily routine would be great - esp when there are accidents on the road or etc.
"Hey guys, I own a broad link and a few other devices and very often I have compatibility issues. Sometimes when I say Turn On tv, instead of turning it on, assistant would search for this content.  First I thought it has something related to my G account being  an G Suite account (enterprise?). Then I migrated all the settings to a personal Gmail, switched the account at assistant settings but no improvement... Sometimes it works, sometimes doesn't.  Anyone has any clue of what's happening?"

"According to  my Google Reminder list, I have 95 completed reminders, but no matter  what steps I take, I am flooded daily with these same so-called **past**  reminder that I have already deleted, but either mysteriously reappear  listed in the ""At A Time"" list as ""overdue"" or as normal reminders right  below the ""overdue"" reminders.     BTW, What is an ""overdue"" reminder?   Furthermore,  Even if they do not reappear on the active reminder list, I still get  reminders from the completed list, and who knows where else?   And if you try to remove an item from the ""Completed"" list, it puts it back on the active list.     I  searched for answers, but most of the suggestions refer to the Google  Calendar.  Google Calendar related reminders apparently have similar  issues, but for me, this is a **Google Assistant** reminder problem.   If  i turn off Google notifications, will that stop the reminders? If so,  what other side effects can I expect, i.e. will turning off the  notifications stop clock alarms.   I just want it to stop.  How do I purge the reminder list for good?"
"Does Google Assistant not play the name game anymore? Whenever I ask nowadays, just for fun, it just plays the song instead. :("
"I have a few commands that I would like the assistant to execute. For example ""Hey google, I'm leaving home"" Than the command is to disable phones Wi-Fi and enable mobile data instead. But the assistant wants me to unlock the phone first, and even if I do so, it forgets what I just said, and replies with some random answer instead.  I want it to execute certain commands in Lockscreen Mode. How is that not a thing?"
I was looking through the mint app and noticed there is an option for Google Assistant integration. Does anyone know what it does?
Samsung Note 10 plus. How do I fix this
"Is there a way to pick and choose which news sources to hear?  There's a glitch with CBS News updates.  The volume is way too high only from CBS, much louder than the other news sources, and it's usually the first source that plays when I ask for the news in the morning.  Really obnoxiously loud, not a good way to wake up."
"In the next week I will start to work on electricity in my new house.  I want a Led strip in the living room and in the kitchen, I was thinking, why not control them from home assistant ? And not only control on/off also control the colors...  I found some in AliExpress, but not sure if there is any option to control it by assistant ?"
"How can you make it stop talking so much. Meaning,every time a scene turns on,it says that it activates it. Or everytime a light isn't set up properly it talks for another whole hour about what the problem is. Is there any way to change that and make it just use a specific sound to show you that something worked or not? It isn't convenient at all. I was thinking of taking the whole set of the Google home assistant containing the hub as well,but the more I use it the more annoying it gets. If this continues I can't help but make the change to Alexa!"
the title says it all.  I want my tv to turn on whenever I give a command that interacts with my Chromecast in any way.  Is this at all possible? I'm willing to use third-party tools as necesary

"Just set up my new Home Hub. It's playing the intro video and says 'ask me to show you how to cook croissants...' So I say '*Hey Google, don't show me how to cook croissants*' - to which it replies 'here's some videos showing how to cook croissants'.   Does it have to be that childish!! :-)"
So a few months ago my assistant stopped making the acknowledgement sound when I activate it.  I messed about with settings and finally discovered the accessibility installed services fix. When I switched on my phone companion the sound came back.  Now for some reason the sound has stopped again. I can't seem to figure out why or what's casing it to stop. And yes I really do want the sound as I use it to find my phone and it helps to know when assistant has acknowledged me when my phone isn't close by.  Any ideas what's causing this and how to fix it? It's a right pain in the arse.
"Lately, Assistant hasn't been working properly. With the cover open, it works like it should. With the cover closed (original Samsung cover with the magnet) it will launch, but whatever I say will just be displayed as text in the Assistant window. This is mostly annoying when I'm out walking and need to make a call. To make matters worse, if I click the ""Call XXX"" text in Assistant, it \*will\* call, but will hang up again if I close the cover. This does not happen if I make a call ""the old fashioned way"".  &amp;#x200B;  Anyone know what might be causing this? Winter's coming (no, not in a GoT way - literally) and I'd like to be able to operate my phone without taking gloves off and stuff.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!"
"Hi everyone, is anyone else having issues with Google assistant voice activation? For me, voice match stopped working and I can't enable it again, I get the msg"" this feature is currently unavailable for this language "" I haven't changed any settings. I'm on an OPPO Findx2 Neo Android 10"
"As the title says really - I have 'hey google' activated, but after my screen is locked it will not respond (if I turn off any type of screen lock, it won't respond after the screen goes 'inactive').     If I turn on any type of screen lock (except swipe - it does not activate the unlock with voice option), unlock with voice appears as an option. When I turn it on, it asks for verification by using the unlock method then goes back to the previous page and gives me a warning... if I click ok it jumps back to the verification screen. This then gets stuck in an endless loop with the option never turning on.  Hours of googling provides seemingly no solution - I have tried any suggested 'fixes' found, or simply locked threads on the google forums where no help/solution is given. I have cleared cache and data, uninstalled and reinstalled, I cannot turn on personalise while locked as this won't appear until I turn on the unlock with voice option.  For specifics - Galaxy S6 running Android 7.0, Google app installed/updated (assistant will not run at all if I revert to base system version), and the issue presents whether I have the google assistant app installed/updated or running base system version     Has anyone found a way around this?"

"I actually want it to do exactly what it says it is…but it doesn't add anything.  Weird this is – I can't seem to find anywhere where I've configured Assistant to have reminders go to Apple Reminders (vs google's reminders), and can't find anything else saying this is how it should work by default.  It does the same thing if I do it from my iOS device, or from my Google Home.  Any ideas how to get this working, or where it is even configured to do so?"
"Okay so I was stoked to find out that I could not access the snapshot page at a single click. After I had my ""desktop"" icon I deleted the panel that let me create it. The panel just takes up precious space after all.  Unfortunately someone played around with my phone and accidentally deleted the new icon from my home screen. I cannot find any way to get it back.

"TuneIn is the default source for radio stations on Google Assistant. They have been forced to block the majority of overseas radio stations from the UK due to a High Court ruling.

"Ever since my pixel 3a was updated to android 11, my assistant does not speak through bluetooth.  I can launch assistant with the truck controls, and I will get the beep sound from Google waiting for me to speak, but once I give it a command such as ""text person"", the assistant no longer asks what the message is or anything. I simply get another beep which I know is indicating she is waiting for me to speak, but without looking at the phone I have no way of knowing what assistant is asking. For example, today I wanted her to text someone for me, and I have multiple contacts with the same first name, so on my phone the assistant asked which contact it was for clarification, but the question did not come through the sound on the head unit, only the beep which follows to prompt you to speak.  This was never an issue before android 11.  Truck is a 2019 f150 with sync 3.4 using bluetooth on Pixel 3a."

However, now I have a problem where Google Assistant keeps creating a list called ""Shopping List"" on shoppinglist.google.com despite me repeatedly deleting it. Plus, there already IS a list on Keep for shopping.  Is there some way I can stop this behavior? It's really annoying when I tell Google to add something to the shopping list and it doesn't do it because it re-created this stupid list and doesn't know which list to use."
Has the Assistant sound (the little bing) vanished in the latest update?  I'm on Android 10 and apart of the Google App beta.  This is very concerning.
"We (my wife and I) have a Family Spotify account that I am primary on.  I listen to Spotify at work and often times my wife, if she is home with the baby, will ask the Google Home Mini to play X song on speaker.  And I lose control of the the Spotify on my PC at work.  And its obnoxious and I can't figure out a solution."
"My dad recently got a new Google Pixel 4a.  He is a truck driver and uses a bluetooth headset to make most of his calls, which uses the Google Assistant.  Every since updating his phone to Android 11, trying to make a call on the headset resorts to Google saying:  ""Your phone's mobile data is turned off, so I can't help you with that at the moment.  Turn on mobile data below, or turn on Wi-Fi and try again.""  Why??  You don't need wifi or data to make a call.  You never needed it to be on previously.  He has a limited data plan so keeping it on all the time isn't an option.  If anyone has a fix for this it would be wonderful because right now he can't make a phone call on his headset without his data on."

"Hello there,  I  want my Smartlife plug (not compatible with Hue but with Google Home) to switch off when a certain Hue scene is  active. I know I could do that with a custom Google Assistant voice  command but I don't want to speak.  I  have a hue dimmer switch that I use to switch between X scenes. When  the scene ""watching tv"" is on, I want to switch off my Smartlife plug  and switch it on when an other scene is on. Therefore I need Google  Assistant to detect when ""watching tv"" is on. Is it something possible ? I tried to find something like this in the settings but couldn't find.  Thank you."
"Today I noticed assistant had begun censoring any ""offensive"" words, which is quite annoying, especially when it tries to say the title of something and it bleeps out half of it (gotta love modern music)...

"I've got a music library of around 10,000 songs albums and every time I ever want to hear. For the best part of 7/8 years I've been able to ask Google assistant to play anything I want from Google music library whilst I'me driving and navigating with maps. All for free, no streaming, no lags, no inherent usages, no dead spots, no fuss. For the last 3 years is been buggy as they are trying to scrap Google music app in favour of you tube subscription.

Is there a way I can chain this whole thing so I don't have to pause 3 times everytime I make a note? In Alexa for example I can ""tell zapier to take note"" which brings the number of step down to 2."

Google Maps and Uber show the correct location, but if I ask Google Assistant any location-related question (e.g. ""coffee around me"") it always falls back to the home location. Also, on the dev side, when I request DEVICE\_PRECISE\_LOCATION in my action, I always get the home address no matter where I am at the moment. I'm pretty certain that the problem is with my phone (Pixel 4, Android 11) but I cannot figure out how to fix that. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
I have recently had to change my credentials for my SiriusXM online streaming account. It was hard enough finding the method to add Sirius initially but changing anything within GA to get Sirius working again seems impossible. I would remove and go through the headache of adding it again but I can't even find an option to do that.  Where do I go to change the login for SiriusXM so GA recognizes the account again?
"I just discovered this. It reads the web page out loud and can even translate a page to English.

"Yeah, okay, you may think I have too much time on my hands, but I enjoy finding ways to make Google Assistant go a little nuts. Currently my favorite way is to ask it this: ""OK Google, what is Avogadro's number to the fourth power?"" It really chews on that for a while. Then ask it ""What's Avogadro's number to the 7th power?"" Heheh... What's your favorite Google Assistant freak out?"
"When I say ""sync my devices"", it says ""sure, synching devices for 6 providers"" (which seems correct) immediately followed by ""sorry something went wrong and I'm unable to control your home device"" followed by ""isn't available, you may try again to set it up"". If you notice, it does not say what ""isn't available"".  So there is something wrong, maybe a ghost provider.  The interesting thing is that I already deleted my home, and even with empty providers, I still get same error.  Any idea?  Thanks"

"So, I noticed that the ""ok Google"" feature have some weird behaviors and I'm wondering if any of you have some insight of how it works and how can I stop these.  So 1. I don't like Google assistant nor do I use it, yet everytime someone say just the word ""okay""+something in a video or an audio clip I watch,it will trigger, and I cannot deactivate it because it will still trigger a page that will ask me to activate Google assistant when the world ""Okay..."" is pronounced. My question is here, why does it have so many false positive and how can I fix there? I've tried to retrain it many times a year back when I was still actually using but didn't seem to have changed anything.  2  And this one is kinda freaking me out. So I dropped my phone like 6 days ago and since then, the mic is completely dead. And when I mean dead, I mean it, even music blasting at full volume can't be recorded, you just hear white noise. So I need to plug in my earplugs in order for the phone to hear me.  And the thing is... With earplugs unplugged, any video or audio that say the ""okay""+something is still somehow triggering Google assistant. I've done some experimentation, I tried triggering it by voice multiple times, and sure enough, nothing happens because the mic is dead, but while playing any random video testing Google assistant, everytime the okay Google is pronounced, it is triggered. So, is Google listening to what I'm listening/watching? Or do you guys have any other explanations for this?  Thank you very much"
"I have a google home routine to run a 10 hour white noise through Help me sleep, it works fine when run from the home app or from the google mini itself, but if I use a Siri shortcut to run the routine through google assistant it plays white noise on my phone instead of the speaker.  Does anyone know of a workaround to force the routine to a certain speaker when invoked through google assistant? Does the routine have to be called through google assistant?  Using iOS 14"
"Since my kids are in virtual school, I set up a bunch of Family bells for both of them in google home devices in their rooms. Worked beautifully for almost two weeks. Then, it started ringing the bells in the wrong time zone. It is also showing the wrong time zone in the family bell settings.

"Hi,  I have somehow lost the ability to activate the assistant via the hot word hey Google.   I've tried resetting the app (both Google and pixel buds) , resetting the buds, resetting the phone but nothing seems to work.

"Just what the title says.  My Chromecast settings haven't changed, my LG C9 settings haven't changed, I've confirmed that CEC is still enabled... but for whatever reason, I can no longer turn on/off the TV with a Google Assistant command to turn on/off the chromecast or turn on/off my TV.

"It appears that ""ok google"" detection doesn't work anymore. I tried everything I can think of. I cleared google cache, tried to turn it on, but it keeps turning itself back off, the language is set to English(US) and I've allowed usage when my screen is locked. I even asked The assistant (manual activation) to retrain voice model.  She then asked to open speech settings and turn on voice match. When i tried to tap on it, I got a notification saying ""app not installed"". I'm absolutely clueless on what to do and I use it all the time, so I really need this."
"Could be an Android 11 thing, but the phone no longer appears in the list of devices in the Assistant settings. Meaning - if you changed anything there (like I did, experimenting with text input instead of voice, you're stuck.  Assistant's settings have always been a nightmare, but good lord..."
"So I had Google Assistant make a few notes for me; thinking that it would use Google's note taking service, Google Keep.      However, I found out that the notes were nowhere to be found in Google Keep. I then found out that it goes to assistant's own ""Lists and Notes"", which in inaccessible though anything over than a mobile device. This I can swallow if it means better integration, but what I can do with this is laughably limited - it won't even read the contents back to me when I am using a mobile device - it only does that on Google Home.      Still more maddening is the fact that if you have assistant display your notes and you take a look inside one of them, there is a field for ""title"". So I am thinking: oh, I guess I can have Assistant modify a specific note or at least refer to a specific note - nope. As a matter of fact, I tried to combine few of my notes under a same title, and now Assistant won't even show me the contents of my notes when I say ""show me my notes"". It only shows me the titles and hides the contents unless I go down another level  I then found out that the ""Lists"" portion of this is even worse - it just opens up a browser to Google Shopping list ([shoppinglist.google.com](https://shoppinglist.google.com) \- which I didn't even know was a thing), and I have to modify things from there, inst. There is very little integration between this and Assistant.      What madman thought this was a good idea to have it operate this way?"
"We've got 3 Home Minis plus Assistant on our phones (S9+ and S10+ respectively). When I say ""OK/Hey Google"" it wakes up both our phones effectively interrupting whatever my wife is doing on her phone. It does not work in reverse when she gives the Google command. I just asked Google to set a timer and it did it on both our phones. We've tried re-pairing her voice. Didn't work for long. I can't see anything in her Home app about recognising my voice. I'm male so it sure as shit should know the difference."

Otherwise, what's a good recommendation for a portable speaker that has Google Assistant built in if I decide just to do one speaker?"
"Hi  So I use Kasa for Smart sockets. I have 4 devices named:  1. Xbox One 2. XBOX 360 3. Nintendo Wii U 4. Nintendo Switch  I at some point, renamed #3 from Wii U to Nintendo Wii U on Kasa. I checked it on Google Home app and it was updated to Nintendo Wii U. Now when I say ""turn off Xbox"", it turns off 1 and 2. However, when I say ""turn off Nintendo"", it only turns off #4. I've tried re-syncing my Kasa account and it still behaves this way. Is there a fix for this? On Google Home, devices are listed above.  I can only interact with #3 if I say Wii, Wii U, Nintendo Wii and the like. All the devices are assigned to the same room.

"Hey there GA!

Nothing is working .... I have an S10 plus.  Can someone help with this?"
"We've had 3 really bad summers/falls of wildfires in California now and we're entering our fourth consecutive year. One thing I have noticed is throughout the years, Assistant struggles with displaying air quality.  Today I tested Siri vs. Alexa vs Assistant and [**here are the results**](https://i.imgur.com/rlPGVTH.png):  * Siri &amp; Alexa: No issues at all. * Google Assistant: Asks you to connect to a 3rd party app which must be fed a location and cannot use your current location. This is a marginal improvement over 2019 where you would just be [fed the definition of air quality](https://i.imgur.com/26OPSEY.png). It makes me wonder. Do Google engineers ever step out the door or look out the window? Is it maybe because Apple's history of having to send engineers to China so much that they are familiar with air quality?  What's also interesting is the stock weather app on iOS shows air quality, whereas it is not shown in the Android weather card. I also distinctly remember [Series 4 Watch having a face that shows AQI](https://www.podfeet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Apple-Watch-Series-4.png).

Now, when I say: call my wife on mobile, Assistant says: I don't know how to help with call my wife on mobile. So it's not like it doesn't understand me... I have to say: call my wife, then it asks: mobile or work. When I say mobile, it confirms by saying: calling wife on mobile... Is it just me?"

"Hey there,  I have been using Google Voice Search/Now/Assistant for a long time now. It never had trouble registering my voice. Infact, it was so good at it, that it understood my voice even when I was eating something. (Yes I know you shouldn't talk while eating, but that's how good it was)  However, recently I've noticed that the voice recognition is getting progressively worse. Bixby understands me the same as it always has, so I know my voice isn't the issue here. But Google just doesn't seem to understand the very same queries that it never struggled with in the past."

"Hi all, I’ve been looking high and low for this but can’t find a clear answer.   Resently Google made Routines available in the Netherlands and I’m looking for a way to trigger my Apple Shortcut via the ‘Bedtime Routine’ in the assistant.   Reason I want it to trigger the Shortcut is because the shorcut makes it possible to sequence my Hue lights; dims the living room, enables the hallway, puts 1st floor on 20%, shuts off livingroom and hal after 1 minute, puts 1st floor into nightlight shortly after. This comprehensive way of enabling/disabling and changing state can’t be done via assistant as far as I know of and neither does Hue or Hue Labs.   So what I’d like to do is have the Bedtime routine do stuff like change the thermostat to a certain setting, shut off the tv or radio and then trigger the Apple Ahortcut for the light sequence.   Is there any way of doing this? Ive tried simply using Siri but then I can’t shut off the tv or radio without the shortcut opening Assistant. And I ofc don’t want to use both Assistant/Siri to get 1 task done. Help! :-)"

"My Assistant has the orange voice (male).  If I ask GA what's on my calendar, he reads my calendar entries in full UNLESS it's an entry for a certain doctor (I'll call him XXXXX here--not his real name, he's not a supervillain or anything).  For those, the orange voice says ""At 11:00, you have"" and then this mysterious woman cuts in to say ""Dr. XXXXX.""  She sounds European; French, maybe.  I thought it might be because the doctor's name ends in ""-in"" (like matin, jardin, vin, etc) but if I add a calendar entry for ""Dr. Matin"" it's the orange voice all the way (with a very non-French pronunciation), and if I add an entry for ""Mr. XXXXX"" it's the orange voice, and if I change a letter in ""Dr. XXXXX"" it's the orange voice, so it appears that the combination of Dr./Doctor and XXXXX is what causes her to appear.    Dr. XXXXX: Orange voice tells me the time, mystery woman reads the entry. Mr. XXXXX: Orange voice tells me the time and reads the entry. XXXXX:  Orange voice tells me the time and reads the entry. Dr. Matin:  Orange voice tells me the time and reads the entry. Mr. Matin:  Orange voice tells me the time and reads the entry. See Dr. XXXXX:  Orange voice tells me the time, mystery woman reads the entry. See Mr. XXXXX:  Orange voice tells me the time and reads the entry. Dr. ZXXXX:  Orange voice tells me the time and reads the entry. Dr. XXmXX:  Orange voice tells me the time and reads the entry.

"Have you achieved voice control features with Google Assistant and using SmartLife devices when screen is locked?  I am trying to order my android to turn on or off some lights/sockets/whatever I have on my SmartLife app. Alexa on Android is not working when screen is locked (i've tried hand-free &amp; everything, but it seems it only works on certain androids), so nothing to do here.  Last option is Google, that one likes listening when screen is locked. It turns on/off devices when screen is not locked using routines. But when screen is locked it tells me to unlock the phone to the task.I also tried webhooks (using IFTTT) but google assistant do not open the link that would turn on-off the device. I  tried directly with IFTTT, that when google assistant hears something it then does X, but it does not work neither.

"Hi everyone, I'm one of the folks who had a problem with the assistants voice screaming over my google home speakers, because media was played loudly hours or even days beforehand.  Anywho, there was a 9-to-5 google article and some news that they'd roll out a volume slider in the EQ.  I became too tired of having to adjust the volume before and after listening to music, so I stopped using my home speakers and decided to wait for the fix. Still having assistant on my phone for access to smart devices around my house. Less convenient, but I don't get screamed at.  I updated the app recently assuming I'd find the feature has been added, but I was wrong.  Now googling, I get that old article from 2019 where they say they're rolling out a fix on iOS then Android, but nothing else for news.  Does anyone know what's going on? Thousands of people had a problem with that, tons of blogs wrote articles mocking how silly of a problem it was, it was a big deal in the little world of assistant features, and it's been a year.. Am I being unreasonable? I put up with the issue for 2 years, and now have waited 1, should I keep waiting?"

"Hey guys,  For the pandemic we got my gran a simple Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2019) in order to Skype/Whatsapp call and share photos with her. So far it has worked ok but she has limited mobility in her hands and problems with memory. I was hoping that I could set up a voice command shortcut so that ""hey google, call Never"" gets translated to ""hey google, whatsapp call Never"". This is a small thing but for a 98 year old this makes a big difference. My gran is never going to be able to recall words like skype or whatsapp.     I must say I've had a difficult time getting this to work because the location and arrangement of Shortcuts has changed so many times. My understanding is that it used to be in Assistant, then it got merged with Routines and if you have Google Home it's in that app instead of Assistant. I also had to update to Android 10 from 9 and install the Google Home app in order for the routines button to show up but now they don't seem to be working.     I tried creating the shortcut but Google Assistant just says ""Sorry I can't make calls"" when I say the command.     If anyone could give me some guidance I would really appreciate it.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks,  nve"

Some times it works if I ask ""what do you remember about my keys"" but only sometimes. I wonder if they haven't fixed it because no one uses it, or if there is anyone else as frustrated as me.

"it’s ridiculous! Right now I’ve been throwing my phone across the room because I cannot get Google Assistant to pronounce a word right anymore.

It also pronounced 2000 as “mm” instead. That’s one example of shitty AI programming. The only reason why I wanted to switch from Siri to Google assistant because I wanted something that works and for months I thought everything was fine but no what do you expect, she gets a keyword wrong!!

I can use many of the features - Meme ones like saying ""wubba lubba dub dub"" or ""do a barrel roll"".  SETTING an alarm (even being specific as to when it should reoccur - EG, set an alarm at 7:15 AM, mon-tue-wed-friday).  Navigating to menus (wifi, assistant).  Opening programs or googling stuff.  Turning on/off flashlight, raise/lower volume.  So it's not like it doesn't work at all, but those specific commands that lists show *exist* just won't work :(."
How do I get it back? I have tried to clear data of the google LLC app but the text is still not appearing. Idk why was it gone suddenly but I had it a few days ago and I never touched anything related to google assistant function.
"In my current city, if at any time the precipitation is above 20% it will almost always rain. Is there not a way that Google Assistant can tell me what the actual precipitation is for that day other than ""It is not expected to rain"" ?"
"There used to be a switch for enabling Apple Music that only worked through the Google Assistant app on the mobile device. This is no where to be found anymore on my end, but what I’m really looking for is full Apple Music support for Smart Speakers such as the Sonos One.

"I'm using USB Audio Player Pro, and it doesnt seem to be integrated very well with Google Assistant, but does have some Android Auto settings. Im not an Android Auto Deck, but play music through my phone connected to my non Android UConnect system. Saying, play music on USB Audio Player Pro try's to have the app play USB Audio Player Pro. Saying play my classics playlist on USB Audio Player Pro doesn't work either. and this is after turning off the existing music services other wise it try's to have google music play USB Audio Player Pro.  The only way so far has been to say launch or open USB Audio Player Pro and then after its open just say Hey Google....Play."
Any recent simple guides on setting that up??
"When using spotify, sometimes stations will just suddenly go quiet, then suddenly lag like one sound per second. At this point, Google will ignore everything you say (including telling it to pause music) until you pull out the plug and reboot it.  Any fixes?"
Today when I went to use the assistant to identify a it just said nothing is playing right now. Before it would listen the mic and try to figure out what was playing alot like Shazam and now it doesn't. Is anyone else having this issue or is it just me? I've got the Pixel 3 XL running the August 2020 patch
I've noticed that 2 of my friends have different Google Assistant UIs on their phones (that look way better than the one I have). I wonder if there's any way I can change mine?  [Mine is on the middle.](https://preview.redd.it/vxml9093v8h51.png?width=1997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a98efc66d784c8bcb8c2e9dfc6a81723c5c746f)
"I just changed my phone(it's a Xiaomi running MiUI11) and went on to enable voice match and lock screen activation for google assistant.

After a while I noticed that on other devices the description of voice match explicitly said that it works with the screen of. Here is a ss of the app on my phone: https://photos.app.goo.gl/fLbTnNa6PcmKnMXr7  As you can see,under Hey Google it says that it works with the screen on,but not with it off.  Does anyone have any idea if there are different apks,or if this is a vendor specific... Or what is going on?  Thx in advance!"
"Was wondering if anyone knows of a way to make Google Assistant launch the [Updates feed](https://9to5google.com/2020/03/25/google-assistant-snapshot/) by default when you hold the Home button on Android? I know you can swipe up to see this, but being able to see my upcoming events, reminders and suggestions at a single swipe would be really convenient. Alternatively having it replace the swipe-left newsfeed could also be handy. Thanks!"
"I just said to GA ""Tell me a riddle"" and she said, ""Do you want a simple riddle or a riddle adventure?"".  I asked for the adventure.  It was pretty much like the Riddle Rooms that went away about a year ago."

"My smart devices all worked flawlessly with GA until this afternoon. I asked Google to turn the lights off and was told my light ""doesn't support that functionality"". I tried my other smart bulb and my smart plug as well and they have the same error.   I figured unlinking and relinking would fix the issue but know the devices aren't recognized when I try to set them up again they can't be found. Has anyone encountered a similar problem and have a fix?"

"So I have a Lenovo 10"" Smart Display in my bedroom and a JBL Link View in my living room. I've always had a Goodnight Routine that turns the brightness on my Lenovo down to 10% and a Good Morning Routine that sets it to 100%.   I've tried to figure out a way to make these changes also apply to the JBL in the living room.. but for the life of me I can't figure out how. When I go into Routines, it asks me which device I want to run this one, and it's set to the Lenovo. Is it possible to still control the JBL's screen brightness if Routines are set to run on the Lenovo?"

I've never had any issues. but as of earlier today, google assistant says it is unable to reach my lights. in the google home app, i've tried to unlink yeelight and reconnect it and it won't reconnect. The lights work just fine through the yeelight app, but it seems impossible right now to connect it to google assistant. Any help would be appreciated, thank you."

Thinking it might have something to do with Continued Conversation, I disabled it. That failed to resolve the problem. I also reset and reconfigured the speaker, but to no avail.  Please share any ideas about how I might resolve the issue, as the annoyance makes the service is virtually unusable. Many thanks."

"I swear in the past, when actively playing music on your device (I'm using Google Play Music), you could ask Google ""what song is playing"" and it would just give the track information instead of trying to listen for something in the environment.

I have a set of wireless earbuds and frequently listen to music in radio mode to find new favorites, and it'd be nice to get track info without having to take my phone out to look."

I also have a smart garage door opener.    I believe I could connect opening of the garage to turning the lights to full brightness, however  I don't want opening the garage at 7a to leave the lights on all day, nor do I want opening the garage at 11p to leave them full bright all night.     What I really want is to set lights to full brightness FOR FIVE MINUTES and the revert to normal schedule.  Any ideas for accomplish this ?"
Does anyone know of a way where I can set up a Google Assistant routine on my Pixel every day at the same time?   For example can I set up a routine on my Pixel so that at 6:00 a.m. everyday my phone will tell me the traffic without me having to gesture or do anything?

How do I fix Google not responding a second time? I hope I'm making sense"
"Google Assistant (on a Sony LF-S50G) has just started saying “Sorry I didn’t understand”. She then actually does what I asked.   I’ve tried to delete that device completely and reinstall it to see if I get a fix. No joy. In fact it’s actually got worse as she doesn’t even do what was asked now.   One such example is to play a song (Spotify is default).  Every night I asked Google to play the sound of rain and that also does not work now.   I’ve turned voice match on and off, retrained voice as well.   Any ideas please?"
"For the past few weeks (if not months) when I've used the bedtime routine to turn my living room lights and plugs off and turn my bedroom lights on, there's always one random device that doesn't work right. It's never the same light or plug the same night, either. I guess I'm wondering if there's an undisclosed limit on how many devices can be turned on or off with a routine - my bedtime routine is at 11 devices but maybe Google actually limits it to 10 or something. Does anyone have any thoughts on if that's true, or if it's not, how to fix my routine?  (Side note: ""Hey Google, sync devices"" has not been working either, but I've been able to manually sync services in the Home app, so I don't think it's an issue with devices not syncing up.)"

"When I ask GA to play Faded by Alan Walker (just an example) on Spotify, it plays an instrumental version. Why? Is there a way to get it to play the normal album version? It does this on many songs, not just Faded. It's really annoying and hinders the experience. On other songs, sometimes it'll be an instrumental, sometimes a remix, other times a cover. I just want the album song, seems like this would be the default. Not sure how it selects, first pick in a search?   Any advice on how to get better results? Magic command to use? Thanks."
recently downloaded google assistant for my IOS device and when i give the instruction to send a text message it drafts it and accepts my command but i never get confirmation it was sent and when clicking on the message itself in google assistant it takes me to my drafted message.

"""OK Google, at 9 remind me to schedule an appointment with **MY** doctor""  &gt;Schedule an appointment with **YOUR** doctor  ""OK Google, at 5:30 remind me to make some sandwiches for Edward and **MYSELF**""  &gt;Make some sandwiches for Edward and **YOURSELF**  It never reverses pronouns like I did above. If I say ""my"", the reminder is saved as ""my"" and it feels weird when Google Assistant reminds me to schedule an appointment with his doctor or make a sandwich for him. If I use first-person pronouns, it will read back first-person pronouns.  Conversely, if I want the reminder to say ""your"" when it shows up, I need to talk to Google Assistant like I want to be reminded to, again, schedule an appointment with his doctor or make a sandwich for him. If I use second-person pronouns, it will read back second-person pronouns.  Not exactly what you'd expect from a smart assistant IRL."

"I've been having problems with the Read My Book command.

"I'm pretty annoyed that there's no true hands free feature included in Android or Google assistant without spending $230 CAD on a pair of pixel buds.  Currently hands free mode means you can say hey Google and ask the typical Google assistant questions like what animal has the biggest penis; but how about some actual useful hands free features like reading and replying to notifications? A few years ago, most OEM's had these features.   This seems morally wrong on Google's behalf to strip a feature like that out in order to turn an additional profit on it.  It's like car companies charging extra for wiper blades all of a sudden."

I say ""add milk to shopping list,"" Assistant replies, ""what list do you want to add that ta?"" (Yes, ""ta"")... Which is already problamatic (it has always just added things to the correct list). Then, if I select ""shopping list,"" it just reads me what's already on my list. I use Keep connected to Assistant. Any insights would be appreciated. Thanks!"
"Hi there. I don't use ""hey google"" to open assistant.. I prefer to just long press my home button (galaxy s20+).  I have a Bluetooth dongle in my car that speaks to both my phone and my stereo to enable me to play music. The Bluetooth unit is a button on it that I can press to open up hands free voice command on my phone which is great for then asking for directions or making calls etc.. however it opens bixby (which I don't use) rather than assistant.   As far as I can tell, Google assistant is set as the default voice assistant. I don't think I can remap the car Bluetooth unit?   Does anyone have any ideas as to how I could change this?

I only see how to make a routine that is triggered by a voice command (or voice command plus schedule).  I would like to make a routine that is triggered by another device... but I don't see this option.  So the actual routine is IF (alarm system disarmed) THEN (set thermostat to a comfortable temperature)  and conversely  IF (alarm system armed) THEN (set thermostat to an uncomfortable temperature)  Please advise on how to do this as Google Searches aren't getting me there.

"I manage thousands of devices across multiple platforms, I have teams of developers using the APIs formally and informally to access GA.  Across ALL experiences, across all global regions, the ""Hey Google"" instigated sessions are FUCKED and have been for a few weeks. We are looking at over 50% sessions being unsuccessful.  The application commonly freezes when initiated by voice and the API  has started to require a ""Hey Google"" or other ""Hey Google""-length preamble before it will process input EVEN IF a different wake-up phrase has been coded. Non-audio initiations are performing far better.  Received audio AFTER a ""Hey Google"" is regularly poorly interpreted and performance remains bad throughout the session, not just immediately following wake-up.  Anyone else also witnessing a surge in general fuck-uppery?"
"I'm not sure what's changed, but I regularly use my Nest Home Max to play music through YouTube Music.  When I need to stop it, I can usually say ""Stop"" or ""Stop playing music"" and it will.

"Tracking Amazon packages doesn't work when it uses Amazon's proprietary shipper. If it uses UPS or FedEx etc, it will include the tracking number in my gmail and hence Google Assistant can read it and tell me where my packages are when asked. However, if the order is shipped using Amazons own deliver, it makes us go to the Amazon site to see tracking info and Google can't read that. Any Ideas on a workaround?"
"Posting a screenshot from my Wear OS watch for reference as to what the reply is.  For a while, I was able to ask the Assistant to ""open/close the garage,"" and she would reply to confirm my code when opening. For some reason, it now replies telling me I've failed too often and I have to use the device's app to complete the action. What's strange is, I can still close the garage door.  I've tried removing the account (Meross) from Assistant and re-linking, I've tried completely resetting the garage door and starting from scratch, and I've renamed the garage door multiple times.  I have no idea how to reset this thing so that I can open in. Any ideas?"
"I have many google homes, and I have Philips Hue setup in my home.   Philips hue does not allow you to activate scenes &gt; ie press the dimmer button and it dims the lights + plays music. Silly example.   Google Assistant lets you set a scene &gt; set the bedroom lights to 15% and play XYZ playlist.  Where this really does come in handy is my baby room, when I put her down to sleep I take out my phone and press the action block widget I created that plays white noise on her google home mini. I cannot program the hue dimmer to perform this task unfortunately. So got me thinking that Google Home should release a wireless remote with hard-keys that can be programmed to perform specific scenes."
"Hi all,  I'm not sure where to ask this, I tried searching for it online, but to no avail.

"Something recently changed on Android where I say ""set a timer 20 minutes"" it previously would open my phone's clock application and run the timer in there.

"I had the assistant action set up to say ""Hey Google! Ask Chevrolet to start my Impala pin xxxx"" and it worked flawlessly.

"When I used GA frequently, there used to be a game of some sort where you would answer questions each day &amp; amass points for the answer that (I think) most people clicked, at the end of the week, whoever had to most points often won stuff like a Google Home etc.  There was a specific phrase that you had to say to your assistant in order to trigger the game &amp; I can't seem to find anything about it on the Web other than [this](https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/35008539?hl=en) - I even went through my history of commands to try and find it to no avail.  The closest thing I can find to it is the Google Opinion app so, does anyone remember the phrase, or know what happened to the game?"
"Haven't seen much from TheVerge or CNET other than the initial announcement.   Is this supposed to be a developer facing event, consumer facing event, or both (like WWDC)?"
"I have the assistant app, not a Google home, and since the app can always be activated by saying ok Google I was wondering if it would be activated thru earbuds mics too or if it's exclusive to your phone mic unless you have pixel buds"
On the opposite side of how it can make calls and make bookings?
Is it possible to include an action in a routine that would send my current location?
Just wondering if there is a simple way to shortcut to the assistant snapshot.  I always find anything like that is pointless if it can't be accessed in 1 step.
"Somehow, Headspace started coming up when I invoked google assistant (which I have assigned to voice commands when I press a button). I had no idea what Headspace was until this happened and I researched it, but somehow it took over my assistant. I have never installed headspace, it's not an app on my phone or in my google account, and it is nothing I have ever set up in google. I got rid of it by clicking on some button and choosing ""don't use google assistant to help with headspace"" or something like that. I don't know exactly what it said because I was so mad that this thing had apparently hijacked my phone that I was not thinking clearly.   Anyway, is there any way to ensure this does not happen again? Again, I don't have a headspace account, have never installed the app, never asked google to use it, my google account has no subscriptions, and I don't see it mentioned in any of the google app settings. Thanks for any help."
"Hi all,  I need sometimes to write punctuation in text (it's in french but it wrotes ""-"" instead of ""less""... They are prononced and written the same).  Is there a way to tell the assistant to write the punctuation I just said in plain text?  Maybe something like ""I need to see the next comma in text please exclamation mark"" --&gt; ""I need to see the next comma please!"""
I'm stuck on keyboard and the original way of getting to Preferred Input under Speech and Voice is gone..
Hi all! I recently switched my sonos ones over to the google assistant and am getting acquainted with the system!  I was wondering if there was a way to pull up the control for sonos on the Nest Hub Max as shown in the picture. It comes up when I ask nest hub to perform actions via voice but I can't seem to find it in the UI. I have all my sonos ones running google assistant as well and they work as default speakers for the nest hub but can't seem to find the UI control.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/kvu1smy3h4951.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79fc0cf247e9c055a83737e73a1ae729a9d79d76
"When GA (on iPhone) tells me that it will remember an address for a contact, where does it save that?     When i say ""what is the address for &lt;contact name&gt; it  sometimes says ""here is the contact information for &lt;contact name&gt;"", but that address is not saved in the contact info on my iPhone, or in contacts.google.com.   I want to remove the address info."
"My girlfriend and myself both have personal results setup on various speakers throughout the house.  To test that personal results is working, I ask ""Who am I?"" to the Assistant. Normally this would result in the Assistant saying the name of who asks the question, but now it states that personal results needs to be activated for that to work.   Any ideas?"
"I saw this posted once before 9 months ago but it was deleted. Google Assistant will not respond to questions posed if they contain the word ""cannabis"". I'd rather my google not be censorious to this stuff and just serve me results.   if you ask ""tips for growing outdoor cannabis""  ""tips for watering cannabis"" etc it just says ""i dont understand"" bullshit you don't... just serve me results fucker"
"Is there a way for a Routine to open an app, then open another app straight after? (eg. YouTube &amp; Sleep Timer)  I noticed once it's opened an app, it doesn't relaunch Assistant and open the 2nd app"
"I am mainly using Google Assistant to turn on/off lights and set alarms/timers.  &amp;#x200B;  Here's the bugs that I encounter that I can't find a way to fix it:  &amp;#x200B;  1.) I can't give 2 commands in a row. The first command is executed properly. Second one notices what I am saying, has a different ""beep"" sound and I get three loading dots that are stuck in a loading animation. It works fine when I say the first command, press the home button and then say the 2nd command. I have enabled the continued conversation already.  &amp;#x200B;  2.) Sometimes it wants my phone unlocked for commands, sometimes it doesn't. I can't tell why, because it doesn't make sense. I can turn on 3 lights without unlocking it, but the 4th one wants it unlocked. Sometimes setting a timer works without unlocking, sometimes it doesn't. Super annoying when you rely on Google to set the timer and then realize that it didn't do it.  &amp;#x200B;  3.) Trouble at turning on grouped lights. Single bulbs are not responding in Google while they do in other apps. When I'm ungrouping them, they respond.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Any suggestions? Super desperate about how shitty it works for me"
"This isn't exactly me looking for a solution as I'm pretty sure there is none at this time, but I've had a pixel 3a since release and it works really well with google assistant. But since I am the type of person to turn off all text assistance on my gboard, I have a very distinct texting style and I never capitalize when texting, to the point where if I DO capitalize, people find it strange.  When composing a message google assistant always makes acronyms all caps (I want to say wyd not WYD), and always autocapitalizes the first letter. Does anybody else run into this same frustration? I just wish google implemented at least a voice version of escape characters, so we could do something like ""caps off"""
"TLDR; can you use a individual podcast code for routines or do you have to rely on the name.   I use a routine every morning that toggles my lights and plays my favourite podcast (The Briefing) for the first 2 weeks it worked great! However lately it has been playing a different podcast with the same name, so i changed the function to play “The briefing- PodcastOne Australia” and that worked for 2 days but now it is saying “i cant find a podcast under that name”.  Very frustrating as it found the podcast seamlessly and has only stopped working recently."
I set my morning and coming home routine to play me “my news update” which is a “mix of top headlines” it sounds nice since I have a lot selected but since I am new to this I want to know how long does it play news updates for before it stops?
"Google assistant routines execute slower than in the past for some reason. They have always executed instantly for simple tasks like turning on Wi-Fi, turning off Bluetooth, and adjusting screen brightness. Now they take 10-15 seconds to execute and move on to the next task. Is anyone else experiencing the same? [Pixel 2 running Android 10]"
"hi I've 2 questions, 1) is it possible to change assistants search app from the Google app to chrome so that when I ask assistant to search it opens in chrome 2) I've just moved to Samsung from huawei and on huawei when I swiped to the left on my home screen I got a Google news page that were interesting to me, samsung has a service called up day which I just don't like as much, how can I find these same Google updates, thanks"
"Hi everyone, I want to configure Google Assistant to create notes in Microsoft To Do app, but it does not recognise it. Assistant doesn't ask me about app, when I'm creating a note using voice or keyboard. In Assistant Notes &amp; Lists settings To Do app is not presented. I also re-installed the To Do app, but it didn't help. Any thoughts?"
I use musicolet for my local files on my phone. I’d love to be able to say play my music or some variation and have it open musicolet and begin to play. I’ve been able to set it up so that I say “shuffle my music” and it opens that app but then I can’t seem to come up with a step that actually “presses” the play button. Ideas?
"I really get annoyed when Google repeatedly gets the same thing wrong.  Mistakes are fine, but where is the \*learning\* in GA?  Is there a way to give it an assist and have it \*not\* perform a certain action?    For example, I have my garage hooked up as part of my smarthome.  Because I can, and because my arms might be full carrying trash and recycling I frequently say:  &gt;Hey google, open the garage  Most of the time it works.  But plenty of times it thinks I’m looking for a garage to service my car and she starts her incessant yapping.  She won’t STFU.  Meanwhile I want the god damed door to open.  Ok, google, SHUT UP.  Nope.  She finally mentions a nearby garage and asks if thats the one I want.  Is there a way to look up the recent command and response and tell Google it f’ed up?  Like, \*never\* ask if I‘m looking for a garage again?  Especially at a specific GA (i have a mini in my hallway to the garage) it should know I want the door to do something."

My Google Pixel does not automatically connect to my car's bluetooth.  It is paired but I always have to manually go into bluetooth settings and select the car's bluetooth in order to connect.  Is it possible to ask Google Assistant to do this instead of me doing this manually?
"How come the Google Assistant voice sounds different between my Google Home Mini and Nest Home Hub? I'm using the same language setting (Australian). Dispute being older, the Mini seems to sound much more fluent in its responses. Why is this and how might I fix it?"

"With my phone (a huawei model) google assistant is perfectly capable however when I try and use my wireless earbuds more than half the time it messes up and says ""hi josh"" or ""sorry I didn't get that"" etc which is extremely annoying.

"I have seen a few posts here and there throughout the internet regarding this problem but I have yet to find a answer or solution. My Google Assistant works fine when I activated by using the keyword hey and ask it to search something, but it will tell me that my phone is offline when I'm trying to say "" good morning"" to activate my routine. It does SUS whether I'm on Wi-Fi or not and I've already tried all the basic troubleshooting steps. Toggling the assistant on and off, making sure software is updated, switching from Wi-Fi to network, and I have very good reception where I am in the city via T-Mobile. I started having this problem a few weeks ago possibly a couple of months by this time. Before that it worked fine. Has anyone found a answer to why this is happening or a solution?  Example of what happens:  Me -Hey Google GA - *bleeps* Me - Good morning! GA - Here are some things you can do when your phone is offline. Me : 😭"

"I use Action Blocks (even though I hate how they look), to get started with each day, but I do a different workout each morning, so I end up just looking them up. It would be nice if Assistant could slightly change the Routine based on the day. I didn't really want a bunch of Action Blocks for each day on my home screen lol 😅  -  Also, side note - wish I could toggle Dark Theme with the Assistant.  This was why - my Dark Theme sunrise/sunset schedule doesn't seem to work. I looked it up &amp; it said I needed Location Services on &amp; they are. Which app would they need to be on for, to apply to Dark Theme?  -  Do you use Routines/Action Blocks often?"
"Has anyone else had an issue where you start an album on your phone via Google Assistant and the tracks play in random order?  This past weekend I was on a long drive for the first time in a long time. I setup an album at the start by going Recents within Android Auto. I wasn't driving so I just tapped. That worked normally. The trip was long enough where that album ended. Like I have done a thousand times before, I used Google Assistant to start another album. I said ""Hey Google...Play Midnight Marauders."" It started with Electric Relaxation, the eighth track. The first, most obvious explanation was that shuffle was enabled, but it was not. My next guess was that I had only downloaded a couple tracks off the album. To save data, I have it set to only download on WiFi, so in some cases if I try to play the album then only the few tracks that I have downloaded will play. But that was not the case. It proceeded to play the entire album in random order. My next thought was the track numbers were not set in the MP3 metadata. But if that were the case, the tracks would have played in alphabetical order. Award Tour, the first song alphabetically, played last.  When I got home and could safely tinker with it, I tried several things. If I use the phone touchscreen then albums play in the correct order. If I play via my JBL speakers with Google Assistant or my Google Nest speaker, then albums play in the correct order. With or without Android Auto makes no difference. I tried several different albums by different artists. I saw that the Google app had an update, so I installed that and restarted my phone. The issue persists. The issue only happens when using Google Assistant on my phone."
"I just tried the ""read it"" feature on my Pixel 3XL running the latest (6/2020) update. I open a web page in google chrome (one of the androidpolice  pages known to work), and say ""Hey Google read it"", and get ""Sorry, I don't see a web page on your screen to read aloud. Try opening a web page and try again"".  What am I missing?"

"Since I was stuck in my house for the past few days, I was playing around with Google Assistant. While I was watching a Youtube Video, an advert played and so I waited for 5 seconds then I jokingly said ""Hey Google, skip ad on Youtube"". I t would then skip the ad. Cool. Then i watched another video and the ad counter was 3 seconds. I said the same thing and Google Assistant skipped the ad...I was like damm that's a nice exploit. After that very day, I said the same thing and Google Assistant said ""This feature is unavailable"". I was lowkey kinda sad and I was wondering if Google ever did this to anyone?"
"When I ask Google to start a selfie video, it asks which app I want to use and it gives the options of Marco Polo or Camera. I cannot figure out a way to set the default to always be Camera unless I uninstall Marco Polo (which I don't want to do).  Any help?"
"Why does google assistant sound like a bogan now... Is that what we really sound like? Ask what time does 'insert shop of your choice* close', it sounds like a bogan!!!!"
"My phone has started asking me which device I want to use when I give my Google Hub a command. It is very annoying. When I ask Google Assistant what song is playing my phone asks ""Which device do you want to use"" or ""try asking again and say the device name."" Is there anyway to just turn off the assistant on my phone when I'm home or set it to only come on when I'm not home. I would like it if the GA in any of the hubs take priority over my phone. This used to work great and whatever update was installed messed everything up."

"I've used google assistant on my devices for a few years now, but response to ""okay Google/hey google"" randomly turned off a week or so ago. Now I can't turn it on. Its grayed out in the google app, and tells me to go to the voice input section of my phone settings but that's not a setting (anymore maybe idk). The only thing that's different is I accidentally went through the Bixby setup process because I was tired of it asking if I wanted it to keep track of where I parked. Any assistance would be great."
"Hi, do you have some info about adding czech language into assistant? Few days ago few people noticed some changes in app thats leads us think to czech language will be added soon.

"I'm looking for an 'Always Listening' noise cancelling, Bluetooth Headset that I can command Google Assistant with my voice alone.  (I don't want to have to press or hold a button to activate Google Assistant)   The only pair of headphones I know to be 'Always Listening' are the latest Apple Airpods and unfortunately that feature only works with Siri and Apple devices.   I read somewhere today that the latest Microsoft Surface Headphones II function in this way also but with Cortana.   I would really appreciate hearing about people's experience with the Microsoft Surface Headphones II and if they're 'Always Listening' and if it also works in this way with Google Assistant on an Android Phone.   I look forward to your replies."
"Does this happen for anyone else? I'm using a Galaxy S10E.  Whenever I say a command, I have to either wait until my phone locks, or hit the home button, before issuing another command, otherwise the assistant will just hang with a (...) until my phone locks and it gives up. It's annoying when I'm trying to add multiple things to a list, or correct the first command.     Another question, what's a good app to use with Google Assistant that makes it easy to create to-do lists? I have been trying to use Keep Note, but it's very clunky. I find that I have to say very specific phrases that don't make sense."
When using the GA on my Smartphone there is pencil next to the sentence. I can manually edit the command if GA did understand me wrong.  Is there something like this for commands your smart speaker did understand wrong?

"I'm using Google Keep for my shopping list. I keep a list of all the things I regularly buy and just untick them when I need them, and tick them off again when I'm at the super. But asking Google to ""untick X on my shopping list doesn't work"". If I ask it to add the item, it makes a duplicate. Is there any way to untick items through Assistant?"
"I don't have a speaker, I am just using my Samsung Galaxy S10E.  I created a routine called ""Morning"" that runs at 8:30AM. It just tells me the weather.  When I speak the command ""Morning"" it works properly. But at 8:30AM, my phone just vibrates with the notification ""The 'Morning Routine' has started. 1 action may need your attention. Please tap the notification for more details.""  Any idea why it doesn't read the action outloud? I was hoping to use google assistant as an alarm clock, saying the weather and my agenda and playing some music. Do I need to buy a Google Home speaker?  Thank you"
"So i connected my Samsung tv to SmartThings, and then SmartThings to google home on my phone. Now when i say ok google, turn on tv all good.

"Just windering how you make Google Assisstant do a small window pop up at the bottom of the screen, instead of the giant separate window that stays open?  I swear for a month I had the feature, now i don't. It's happened off and on. I like the small assisstant that opens, I ask a question and then it goes away.  It's very annoying when you're trying to quickly multitask and that window stays open from a question you asked."
"I have used Google assistant for some months on my new Pixel phone, it was working perfectly fine with voice command, squeezing, taping, until recently it is not responding when I say ""Ok Google"", when I squeeze it only appears in screen and without even saying ""How can I help"".

"When I ask Google Assistant on my phone ""What song is this?"" when I'm out and about or listening to the radio, it always answers with the last song I casted to my Home Mini at work from my computer—sometimes days prior. Lol  Only way I can get a legitimate answer from the phone Assistant is to detect the music the old school way: open Google search, hit the mic button, and hit the music detection button after it pops up.   I'd rather not have to do it that way, so any tips on how to get Assistant dislodged from my Home Mini's last music session so that I can detect music elsewhere?"

I'm using Google Podcasts and have a few Podcasts am subscribed to. However when I ask GA on either my Pixel phone or home devices it plays random Podcasts like Joe Rogan which I'm not subscribed toO. this something I can fix or is this by design? Can anyone else test to see if you ask GA to play a podcast if it plays from your subscription or just random Podcasts?
"With yesterday's update Google Assistant will no longer set alarms or timers with voice commands. Saying ""Set a timer for 45 minutes"" just opens a search page. Same with trying to set an alarm. I removed the update, reverting the app to its factory default, and it worked again. Reinstalled the update and the functionality is gone. Anyone else having this problem?  Galaxy S9+, fwiw.  In the meantime, I'll be cleaning burnt chicken off a pan."
"When I set a reminder on my phone, it seems to only pop up on my phone. I also use an iPad and would like to be able to have it remind me there as well. Is this possible?

Is there a way to pull up a list of things I have asked Google to remember? Like... In actual list form.... Not by going through the my activity and haven't to filter through things that aren't even related even slightly.
When listening to music one would press the button on the earphones to pause and play music right? Google assistant just pops up. The music won't pause and i have to hear that irritating ping sound. I've tired disabling GA but it doesn't help at all cuz I just get a pop-up to turn on Google Assistant and it still doesn't pause my music.
"My pixel 2 is kind of acting up lately and I can't for the life of me figure out why.   If I *tell* Google assistant ""ok Google remind me"", it'll bring up a reminder thing that I can fill in.    But when I type in the same command (remind me) in the same field, I get a bunch of YouTube links to some country song. This never used to happen.  I also have problems when I try to type in a countdown timer vs telling it to start a countdown timer. (Ex ""countdown to 5pm"")  The voice command works fine and it starts a timer. Typing it used to give me a button to start the timer, but now it just tells me how long the timer should be with no app integration.   My husband also has a pixel, and his still works fine with both voice and text. I don't know if I could've accidentally changed a setting or something. All of the relevant looking settings are enabled, and look like they match his settings.  It's driving me nuts that it just suddenly stopped working properly.  Has anyone else experienced this, or know what I might be doing wrong?"
"Since google assistant is pretty much useless in my language, I don't want the long press home button to bring it up.

So I bought some smart displays so the kids could video call the grandparents but when they say call Pappa it says it can't because they don't have access.   I have tried sharing it with them but you need a phone number to set up Duo for it and they do not have a device with a phone number. It seems a bit crazy to me that there isn't an easy way for a family to use this to make video calls. I just want anyone bro be able to walk up to it and say call so and so and for it to do it. Is that possible?
"I've set up some simple routines about, about a year back, to turn some lights on/off at different times.  They never gave me notifications before, as I had that box unchecked (see below).  Now I'm getting notifications on my phone and tablet, and I can't seem to stop them short of blocking all notifications from Assistant/Google...which seems like an incorrect scorched earth policy to stop one or two errant notifications.  Not all of my routines do this.  Just a couple random ones.  I may have changed the time or days, but I'm sure I never enabled notifications (and as you can see, they're disabled).

It's quite annoying. All I want is for it to read my news in the morning from my sources / feeds as it used to. Now it goes into a random YouTube channel thing on TV. Anyone know how to stop or revert this awful change?
"For the past few days, every smart home command I send to the GA on my Pixel 3 phone results in ""Sorry, I don't understand,"" ""Sorry, it looks like that device hasn't been set up yet. You can do that in the Google Home app,"" or ""Sorry, I don't recognize that device. Please use your device name.""  I've tried un/re-installing the Google Home app on my phone to no avail. All of my Google Nest Mini speakers and Google Home Hubs seem to work fine (i.e., they understand my requests to control devices), but I have noticed that my phone seems to try/fail to respond anyway, even if another GA device has already started responding. It's as if the GA app on the phone has lost its connection to the rest of my Google-connected services.  Any ideas?"
"The use case is as follows:  I have several google home devices, but I also carry my phone with me everywhere.  If I ask Google to perform a task, for example, my phone's assistant triggers and listens at the same time that the device I'm talking to does. Sometimes this ""confuses"" the system and, even though the home device is supposed to override the phone, this doesn't always happen. However, disabling the assistant of my phone breaks my intended use of it from my car.   If I dissable the assistant from my phone to fix the issue inside my domicile, then when I use my car and want to use the assistant, I can't because it's disabled so I have to re-enable it.  Is there something I could do so that the assistant from my phone is always dissabled when I'm at home, but always responsive when I'm in my car?  Thanks."

"Or how about this?  You're my ""assistant.""  Why don't you fucking try again in a few minutes, then report back to me when you've fixed it?  Instead of creating work for me."
"I've been using GA to pause media on my TV for ages. In the last few months, instead of pausing media, it prompts to verify the command. I say, Hey Google, pause Toshiba. G: I understood that as Pause Toshiba, is that correct? It's maddening. My GH is not even four feet from me mounted to the wall outlet. Happens across all services, Hulu, Netflix, D+, and Google Movies. Any ideas?"
"Hi folks!  I'm making a meme of sorts, and wanted it to look like a conversation with Google Assistant. Problem is, I can't find a template which I can conveniently edit to do so, nor can I find any tools which could help.

"I've enjoyed the ""Broadcast"" feature on our Google Home speakers in the past, but they always activated simultaneously (we have four around the house).

"I'm more mad every day. Every single time when I ask any of my Google Homes to just **play music**, I get the exact set of songs. Always the same Green Day songs (I used to like them... not so much now after hearing them so often), always the same few electronic songs  Unless I clearly specify some kind of a playlist/music type/album, the simple ""play music"" which resulted in impressive and enjoyable variety using Google Play Music now regurgitates the same few songs over and over again. I have no playlists that it would be pulling them from.   I can't take it. I've had enough of Green Day. Send help. Is there any way to change the ""play music"" behaviour to be more randomized?"
"Hello.  I just got my new OnePlus 7T (running Android 10) and I can't play music on Deezer via Google Assistant.

"I didn't have any problems for months, but the last couple weeks my Home Mini, playing music from Spotify, has been just stopping multiple times while playing.   Sometimes I'll look at Spotify on my computer and it says it's still playing, other times it looks as if it's been paused.  I have to ask google to start playing the music again repeatedly throughout the day and it's getting really frustrating. Like 4 or 5 times in a 20 minute period.  I have restarted my computer and unplugged the mini to force it to reconnect to the network. Neither has fixed the issue.  This only happens with Spotify. I listen to things on TuneIn pretty often, too, and never have that problem.  Anyone have some troubleshooting tips on what I might do to correct this? I realize there are a bazillion variables, but figured I'd see if anyone else had run into this problem."
"Every time I ask google to play either rain sounds or music on spotify it executes the command but will aslo say ""I don't understand"" or something similar. It is very annoying. It doens't happen on phone. Just on a google home mini and a google home.  Has anyone else encountered this problem? I can't seem to find a fix. Any help would be great for my sanity."
Not sure if this is the right place for this but I was wondering if I could make the assistant read random YouTube comments from my videos. I know there's the developer tools but I'm not experienced in programming or if it is even possible to make the assistant read YouTube comments. If anybody could help that would be appreciated.
I tried. I searched. I can't find the means to block a news feed of a particular news network on Google Assistant app. I say 'Good Morning' and I get the weather and then the news. It is always the News from an outlet I have long before chosen not to entertain. I did select the outlets I wanted and placed them in the order I have chosen but still this problem persist. I would hate to delete the apps without exhausting my sources of help. Reddit can you help me?
"I'm trying to set it up so that a specific speaker group (all google speakers in the house called ""Bedtime"") will tell the kids to Brush their teeth and get ready for bed.  I can set it so that the speaker group will play music, but I'd like the google assistant to be able to speak across the speaker group, so that no matter where the kids are, they will hear it.    So far, I have all speakers set to 50%, 6 individual commands  and then the command of:   On Bedtime Say ""Time for bed, brush your teeth and get pajamas on""  All the speakers change to 50% but I can't get google assistant to speak across the speaker group.

"Ok, in my defense, I tried Google Assistant for like a year, gave it an honest shot, along with my Wink hub to control lights, and then gave up on it and moved over to something else. I can't actually get rid of all Google Assistant because it's on my phone, but I turned off a lot of things and locked down permissions and just stopped using it. I had added a bunch of routines and lights and apparently did not delete them. But now I'm resetting EVERYTHING due to the Wink debacle, planning on moving to a new hub system, and want a clean slate. I figured to disconnect the lights from Assistant, just to be sure. Well... I can't find the delete button? I click the gear button next to the device groups and it links to download and install Google Home? Same thing with deleting old routines, I just can't find the delete button. Please tell me I don't have to install Google Home just to do this?"
I just asked my Google hub for a synonym of agreement: it started to answer and then went silent  And when I asked it where it went it said I don't know when ookk 😅

A few weeks ago, the google assistant started using ""to"" instead of ""2"" when asking for my pin. Is there anyway to solve this problem? I could change my pin but I feel that is only a temporary fix and that the system should be smart enough to differentiate when a number is expected and now a word.   This is what happens: ""hey google, open my garage door""... ""May I have your pin please?""

Now it works fine as long as my network provider does not fk with the network and disconnects everything. But I don't have a smart speaker, I use my phone.  Now each time I give it a command, let's say - Hey google - Turn on kitchen light - it pops up at the bottom, turns on the light and then opens the whole assistant interface on the screen saying ON.  Can't it do it in the background without opening up on my whole screen? So I say - Hey G....turn on... - it pops up at the bottom, says turing on, and then go away leaving my phone screen on what ever it was.  Can't seem to find anything regarding this so not sure if it's possible.  I do get that if I ask it - recipe for pancakes - it has to open on the screen to show it to you.

So I have a couple routines that I use for around my house with my home minis but all of the sudden when I try using the routines on my phone (pixle 2xl) it shows me web results instead and ignors the routines. Sometimes I feel that the assistant is downgrading instead of upgrading.

I've tried changing it to ""Shopping"" list as well with no luck on the voice commands.  EDIT: In response, it says ""Sorry, I am unable to process your request""  EDIT 2: Figured it out for anyone coming across this. It was an issue with an old IFTTT routine that I had that was ""Add $ to my grocery list"". Assistant was still catching it, even though the routine was disabled. I deleted the routine and reconnected Google Assistant and all seems back to normal"
"Today we were having a few issues getting my entertainment system to do what we wanted it to do. Basically for some reason our Spectrum DVR was off and not turning on, so the way we were used to turning on everything wasnt complete. So we were joking around and I said ""wouldnt it be cool if i I could say ""ok google turn on the switch"" meaning the Nintendo Switch, and a few second later one of our google devices said ""ok, turning on 5 switches"" and our tv turned on, our Neato vacuum tried to start  up, and apparently our garage door opened up. I assume the other two switches were my two garage lights, or the virtual switch that turns on the garage lights and a defunct virtual switch i havent deleted yet. My phone was dead at the time so it was at least an hour until i turned my phone on and got an alert that an IFTTT had been activated and that apparently my garage door was open. So my garage was open for like an hour without us knowing it... why would that command activate all switches like that?"
"Hi all  I'm trying to repurpose my Pixel 2XL to essentially be a music player for my game room. The reason I'm going this route is so I can plug it into speakers rather than purchasing Bluetooth speakers and another Nest Mini.  Essentially the issue is that when I have my P4XL in my pocket and want to trigger music on my P2XL, it's a crapshoot which one will respond to my Assistant command.  I think I know the answer, but is there any way to tell it to perform the action on the 2 instead of the 4 in my pocket?"
How can I get the gift card? I developed an app and google approoved it... Reply..
"Hello, so when I tell Google to ""play X"" it will open Youtube Music (my default) app and play a microsecond of the song and pause it. Then I have to manually hit play for the song to play. Is there any way to fix this?"
"Like, when I ask it to turn off a light, I then always have to physically close the app itself. I'm on a OnePlus 7 Pro using Android 10.  Anyone know how to solve this problem? I want the Google Assistant to respond, and when it closes, to be gone."
"Is it possible to turn off profanity filter for assistant? I want to set few funny routines, but google home mini is beeping out curse words."
I've been looking around for something that tells me what Google as added/updated recently with Google Assistant. No luck finding anything though.  How do you know what google has changed or added recently?
"So i got a new phone, Huawei Y9 and i went to turn voice match on but it doesn't let me, the switch is grey and even if i tap it it doesn't do anything, without that i can't just say ""ok google"" i can say it when i hold my home button but i have to be near my phone, my phone is up to date what should i do"
"I looked into this a while back, and there didn't seem to be any way to disable it at that time.  Just wondering if there had been any developments in the meantime.    When I say please to my device, it is out of sheer habit.  I don't need to be told that my device appreciates it, and what I would appreciate is if the device would just do what I fucking told it to do.    My 8 yr old child says please and thank you because that's the way I raised (am raising) him.  When the device goes into one of its 'pretty please' routines, he asks me why a computer program cares whether I said please.  And I don't have a good answer for him."
"I like to take voice notes that are recorded as text. Right now I use the ""take a note"" command, which works well, except it will stop recording after a sentence or two.  Does anyone know of a way to dictate longer notes?"
"Hello everyone, I can't seem to get my Google Assistant to work properly. I want to be able to command Spotify with it in the car. But I've been trying and I can't seem to get it to work properly. I did now get it to work but only when I open the google app. So what I want to do is the following:  \- Be able to open Google Assistant with the phone turned off (if that makes sense, it has a password so I'm not sure if there's a setting to use it with the phone turned off or that I should disable my password).   \- Be able to command Spotify using Google Assistant.   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks in advance"
"Hey guys I've been using the Google assistant a lot, but since a few days it's not working anymore. Or at least the ""hey Google"" activation. It works the first time after I restart my phone but after that it doesn't work anymore. I've tried restarting my phone multiple times. I've tried turning of the ""hey Google"" activation and then restarting and then turning the ""hey Google"" activation on again.... Also I've got Google home as well and at home it works perfectly... Just not on my phone anymore... Hope someone can help me out. Thanks in advance"
"I had my assistant check out my battery. After she checked my battery, I clicked, ""Sing Me A Song"". She sang me a cool song about washing my hands. LOL  http://imgur.com/a/eq3Mu4Z"
"If so please tell me how, (i want hatsune miku's voice.)"
"So I have a Pixel 2 XL which has the squeeze to activate assistant, sometimes when I handle my phone I accidentally start my assistant and it starts listening. What's funny is it sometimes starts listening to me and wife's casual conversation, it's known for mishearing some keywords which sometimes have amazingly funny results.   It's bedtime, I plug my phone in and lay it on my bedside table. We start talking about our dog and how he's not happy that he can't go out as often in these pandemic times. All of a sudden we are interrupted by Google Assistant and she starts talking about pet flatulence causes and remedies. My wife loses it and start laughing so loud, it's 11pm mind you and were both laughing. I look at my phone to see what it picked up and apparently somewhere it heard us say ""dog farts""   We never said dog farts at all."
"Hi all  I have a mate 20 pro and have recently reset my phone. The OS is the same as it was before but this time I cannot set the voice recognition because the assistant says it is not available in this language. I set the language, region and everything to US, UK and even Aus but none worked. Everything else works properly, even the dedicated button with my bose (also can't give orders though).  Any suggestions how to set this up?"
"Hi all,   Is it somehow possible to create shortcut icons that would then trigger desired actions by assistant?   I know I can open the keyboard and type in ""watch ozark on shield tv"" but is there any way this command could be saved and only require single tap?  Would allow to skip voice commands and typing.  Is there any other app/solution that could do it?  Thanks a lot!"
While I was making my bedtime routine I wanted to get my phone on do not disturb mode and it does but there is a problem it's also puts my phone on silent mode but I don't want that because that way I can't get calls from my favorited calls.
I want it to play the songs that's are stored on my phone instead of forcing me to use a preferred streaming service
"Sometimes I want to use Google Assistant in situations where I don't want any noise.  For example, I think of something I need to do tomorrow will in bed with my partner asleep next to me, so I try to set a reminder.  I activate Google Assistant, touch the keyboard icon, type out my reminder and save, then it blares ""ok, I'll remind you!"". Or I need an alarm, so I'll type set an alarm, again it blares at me, ""ok, set it for when?!""  Is there a path to interact with the assistant completely silently?"
"Why is my WearOS watch not on the list with assistant devices? Phone, TV and headphones are there, but not the watch. Is this how it's supposed to be, or something's wrong? Thanks."
"Hey y'all, it's six colon forty three PM as I type this post. Why is the Google Assistant reading out the colon when I ask for the time or when my alarms go off, it's so weird. 😂"
"I'm currently able to trigger EventGhost events using Amazon Alexa by following the instructions here: [EchoToEventGhost](http://www.eventghost.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7429&amp;f=2#p54675).  I'm looking for the equivalent with Google Assistant.  I couldn't find anything when doing a Google search.  I know there's a clunky way to do it on Android phones with AutoRemote/Join (joaoapps.com).  However, I don't want to depend on my phone for stuff like this; especially, since I already have a dedicated Windows server that runs EventGhost.  Is there such a thing?  Thanks in advance"
"I was using my phone for fb and wssp, out of nothing google assistant actives and said out loud ""this is what you told me. My girlfriends name is ### and my mom's name is ###"" Wich is weird because I broke up with that girlfriend two years ago and I don't have that information as any type of reminder on my phone. Any ideas why this could have happened? (Sorry for my english, not my native language) thanks"
"Hello,  I just bought Pixel 4 and I am thinking about  switching from Alexa to GA.   Anyway I have to few issues:  1.) I ask GA to do someting, GA does it, but, it stays open on my screen. For example I am watching youtube, I ask GA to change volume, GA change the volume, but playing stops, because there is GA on the screen, I have to physicaly close the GA. Can I change this behavior?  2.) If I ask Alexa ""make a call"" she replies ""to whom"", so I know when to say contact name. But GA only open the window on my screen and waits and I have to wait unknown amount of time to say contact. It's possible to change this as well?  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you!"
"I noticed this afternoon that my continued conversation isn't working on my pixel 3a. When I pull up the settings, it says it's turned on. Yet, below that, it says that it only affects my google mini speaker here at home. Did they remove the feature from phones, or am I doing something wrong?"
"Hi, I am using google assistant to update my shopping list. And since a few days ago when I tell it to add something to the list but only when the phone is locked I get the ""Let me get some more info so I can help you with that"". When I click on get started and unlock the phone nothing happens. I googled but found no possible solution. Anyone have any idea what is the problem? Thank you"
Is there a way to make Google Assistant use driving mode instead of Android Auto?
"Is there a way yet to write our own complexe routines? And no I do not mean IFTTT or things like that. I mean a way to write actual code, java, javascript, python etc to write real logic for our routines?"
"So I randomly said hello to my Sonos speaker which has the Google Assistant whilst I was in the other room and it said something about having Easter Eggs and it could help me find them if I asked it to. I asked it to help me find the Easter Eggs and it said a riddle or something about a man walking down a road. I wasn't really paying much attention so I tried to get it to repeat the riddle thing and tried saying hello again to make it talk about the Easter Eggs, but it won't do it again.  How do I get it to talk about the Easter Eggs again? Has anyone else had this happen?"
"For example I will say ""turn off bedroom light"" it will think I said ""turn off bedroom"" and then reply ""sorry power controls for that device are not yet available"". I thought changing it from light to bulb might help, but no, it more often than not misses me saying the last word and i have to try again. Is it just that I can't speak properly or is anyone else having this problem."
Me and  my girlfriend (shes studying psychology) were talking about why Nobita(character from old anime doremon) Make doremon sleep in his closet...so i was replying with he must be hallucinating and talking to a toy...but when i was typing i forgot spelling of hallucination so i tried to google it using google now..but im from small place near mumbai(india) so my house is pretty small so there was lot of noise...so google only detected word personality ( i dont even know how XD) and this was result..!!? 1. I never typed a word related doremon from gboard(im using gboard as my primary keyboard method) so there was no chance that google collected my data n showed similar results 2.how dafaq?

"I have everything plugged into my audio receiver HDMI ports. I tell GA ""Turn on PS4"" and ""Show 'something' on TV"". This seems to be the only way to switch back and forth between the HDMI ports. There is no voice command that I'm aware of to switch to the different devices. Sometimes I want to switch to Chromecast without telling it to start streaming. I also shouldnt have to say ""Turn on PS4"" when it's already on.  There should be voice commands....""Switch to PS4"" and ""Switch to Chromecast/TV""."
"I have 4 lifx light bulbs in my house. The first is a bedroom light bulb in a zone called bedroom. I have had this for years. The other 3 were gifts either for a birthday or for Christmas later in the year. These are in the zone ""living room"" in my lifx and google home app. Both appear to be linked to hte same home in each.  My bedroom light used to be named ""light"" but is now named ""Bedstand"". It has been named this for months in both apps.  When I tell the google assistant to ""turn off the lights"" or ""turn on the lights"" it just turns on this one light.  How do I fix this?"
"For the past couple days, Google has been unable to reach Vizio Smartcast, which is how I usually power on my TV and change inputs. Anyone else having issues with this or know a fix?"
"I'm hoping that someone here can help me get the functionality that I want out of my Samsung Galaxy running Android 10.   I want to have the option to use voice controls to text people and to control maps, for example. However, I don't want the assistant to wake to a voice command. Ideally I want my mic to be *off* until I hit one of the convenient mic-shaped buttons next to an input field.   Is there any way to achieve that? Thanks for any help you can give me."
"Hi everyone, we recently bought an AndroidTV. I've been playing around with it, using my phone and it's google assistant to play netflix etc. Commands like ""play &lt;something&gt; from netflix on tv"", pause or resume work perfectly. But when I try rewind, forward or skip episode, GA only says ""sure"" but nothing happens. Any advice? Is this supported command while using my phone?  I noticed that GA responds twice when I ask it to play from entflix (says ""ok"" and ""sure"" for example) but inly says ""sure"" once when asking for rewind.  Any help would be appriciated."
"Thanks to this spyware I can no longer listen to Pandora. When I try, Google Assist pops up and asks to turn itself on.  Oh yeah, that's right, it is disabled on this phone! But still, a disabled app is coming up, listening to my music, deciding I must need help, STOPPING MY MUSIC, and then idling there waiting for me to interact with it.  I'm sorry I bought a Google phone. Won't happen again."
"After pushing back several times that it was up to JBL, not Google, to update the firmware I finally got the response below. This will bring some of last year's features to the Link 10, 20, 300, 500, though my Link View is already on 1.44  ""Thank you for patiently waiting. We just got a word from our internal team. We are planning to update all google voice assistant JBL products including the JBL LINK 20 by April to Version 1.44.   I would recommend that you allow auto-update on all the google apps that is associated to Google Home App (Google assistant, Gmail, Playstore, etc) to make sure that the JBL LINK 20 will be up-to-date. There is no exact date when the update will take effect on April.   I hope this information helps your inquiry about the update on the JBL LINK 20."""
"I'm trying to have something like a combadge from star trek, which I could press, talk to an action directly (without needing to invoke it) and have it reply.  I've found buttons to trigger routines, but no microphone or speaker.  Does anyone know of any product that does this?"
"I was playing around with settings and messed up. Before, it used to show a cute animation listening for voice commands when you hold down the home button. I liked that.  But right now when I do it a whole panel comes up. ☹️ Anyway I can get around this?"
"I wanna have Google Assistant be enabled only when I'm connected to my car's Bluetooth. I've got a few Google Home Minis around my house, so when I use the hey google command at home, my phone and the Mini will both answer and overlap, making it pretty annoying to actually use while my phone is around. However, I don't want to completely disable it on my phone since I do use the assistant in my car to make calls or answer texts while I'm driving. Any solutions would be appreciated!"
"I use the reminders function all the time but in the last few months it's not functioning very well.  The old way would be something like this:  OK Google   Set a reminder for tomorrow   ""What is the reminder""   Doctor's appointment next Wednesday at 2 PM   ""When would you like to be reminded?""   Next Wednesday at noon    It would then give me a reminder next Wednesday at noon.  However since Android 10 came out, when it prompts me ""What is the reminder"" it doesn't always set the title.  For example if I told it the reminder was ""go to mechanic"" it would immediately search for local mechanics and stop the reminder setup process.  If I give it simple titles like ""mechanic"" it might work but that's annoying."
"I used to use my home button long press to do a voice search on Google. I don't find assistant's ""smart"" replies useful, and would prefer to just search on Google hands free. Any apps that open voice search (and NOT assistant?)"

"I'm curious to know why this is unavailable. I see people that have tried to create apps to make this work that have been taken down from the Google play store, I've seen at least one person that claimed it works but I've never seen it work. I'm basically just want to tell the Google Assistant to play my subscriptions on YouTube on Chromecast.   Does this capability violate some sort of intellectual property that Google doesn't own? Is there a reason Google refuses to allow us to watch subscribed videos from our YouTube feed in order? This seems like the most basic functionality for streaming YouTube onto a Chromecast, but as of today you can only manually add each item from your subscriptions to the existing play queue.   at this point I'm not even frustrated anymore, I'm just curious to find out why..."
"I’m new to smart TVs and I’m looking at getting one with built in Roku. I’m also new to voice assistants and I’m looking at getting a Google Nest Mini. I’ve read that Roku has great integration; I really want to be able to use google assistant to turn on/off the tv, change input, adjust volume. But I’ve read mixed messages about whether or not google assistant integrates with Roku’s Netflix app. I want to say “Hey google, play The Office on Netflix on Roku” and have it work. Can anyone confirm whether or not this works? Does anyone know why there are mixed reports on this (was there a recent software update? Do only certain models allow for this granular functionality?) I want to make sure to buy the right equipment. Thanks!"

"   Hi guys,  I'm trying to create a routine in google assistant so that when i push a button on my headphones and say ""Timer"", it sets a rest timer between sets at the gym.  I currently have a routine set up as in the image attached. However, what I can't figure out is how to stop the assistant from responding with ""Got it. Setting a timer for 1 minute and 15 seconds. Starting now."" EVERY TIME. This gets really annoying and takes up time before the timer starts. Anyone have any ideas or workarounds for how to stop this?"
"My wife has a somewhat unusual name. So I put 'My Wife' in the contact nickname field, and just told Google Assistant to 'Call My Wife'. This was working for months. Now for some reason GA has stopped recognizing this nickname.  Has enabling this changed somehow?"

"When I search for a contact's name in Google Maps I can navigate to their address directly. But if I try to use the assistant by saying ""OK Google, navigate to CONTACT'S address"" it just replies ""Sorry, I wasn't able to find CONTACT.""  Am I doing it wrong?"

"I have a small project using an ESP8266 and an Arduino where I want to make an external clock to put under the Google home, similar to the Amazon echo with clock. One functionality I'm unsure I can do, is asking Google to set a timer, and have it not only set the timer, but also display it. This would require editing the ""set a timer"" command, which I'm unsure on the ability to do so or not. Anyone know anything about this? Or a good subreddit or forum to post this in?"

"Hey guys,    Blinkist offers a daily free summary which you can hear. I'd like the google assistant to start this summary as soon as my alarm rings.    However when I try to set up this routine there is no option to select app services in the routine.  I can only choose stuff like radio and music.    The only assistant service I found yet is the Blinkist minute, but that is not what I want.   Can anyone give me a hint how to do that? Or is that not even possible because it depends on Blinkist to make this an assistant service?   Thanks a lot!"
"I often have to get up fairly early, at different times on different weeks, so I can't set repeating alarms up. In the morning I also have a bad habit of turning off an alarm and immediately falling back asleep, so I set an alarm for every two minutes from when I want to wake up to about fourteen or so minutes after that. Instead of manually putting each alarm in every time, is there a third party app I can use to be able to say something like ""set a morning alarm for 6:00"" and assistant will set an alarm for 6:00, 6:02, 6:04, 6:06, etc.? I already tried IFTTT, but that doesn't work, or at least I can't see a way it will work, as it doesn't let you set alarms"

"Is there a way to force a certain Language to my Google Assistant? What I mean is she should never respond to me in any other language or change the language unless I manually change it.  Or is there a way to simply delete a certain language so my Google Assistant will never use it?     The problem I keep facing is that she starts talking to me in Hindi outta blue and then she switches language to English (India). Then I have to manually switch the language back to English (US) or English (UK).  It's so annoying. Like I give her a simple command and she assumes I am talking in Hindi and then rest is history.  Eg: Command: ""Sing me a song!""  GA: Here are the results for ""Singh Song"" (This sentence is in Hindi when she responds)  Also when she changes the Language, the ""Okay Google"" just stops working. I have change language, delete my voice data, train her again and only then it will work."

"I have a vast local music library on my phone (mp3 files in the Music folder).  I've spent a lot of time curating my music collection which has resulted in lots of playlists (m3u files).    I'd really like to tell Google Assistant ""play &lt;playlist file name&gt;"" and have it launch a music player like VLC or Google Play Music to play specified music playlist.    I haven't had much luck so far.    Both VLC and Google Play Music have indexed my local music library.  While in those apps it is aware of the playlists of interest.  I can navigate within those apps to play my playlists.  The problem I'm having is getting Google Assistant to launch one of these apps and start playing the playlist in response to a request like ""play &lt;playlist name&gt;"".  I've gone to Google Assistant Settings &gt; Services &gt; Music    I select Google Play Music.    Sometimes Google Assistant launched YouTube Music instead of Google Play Music.  Even when it does launch Google Play Music and passes on the playlist name to Google Play Music it behaves inconsistently and incorrectly.  The request has NEVER produced the intended result.  It often makes some attempt at finding something in a myriad of locations on the internet rather that finding the EXACT match in my local music library.  Sometimes Google Assistant fails in it's attempt to launch Google Play Music.    I'd really like it to use VLC rather than any of the ""services"" that are all biased to streaming services and are constantly trying to get me to subscribe to their premium services.  Unfortunately I haven't found a way to set VLC as my default music/media player.  Thanks for any help / insight you can provide on this matter."
"I have a few routines that I do daily or weekly, Just a list of things that I do in the morning or at night or during an hour of the day like check all of these emails or check all of these accounts, then schedule posts, then etc etc  What I'd like: to set up the routine through Google to tell me what to do and then pause..... To give me enough time to complete the task, then say the next thing in the queue. Keeping me on a strict no distraction ""race against the clock"" kind of approach to knocking out my to-do list.

"My wife and I were watching TV in the bed. Something on the dialog triggered some mood phrase that we have no clue what it was. All of a sudden the lights went red and pink, music started playing or attempted to play. Then after about 30 seconds it went back to normal. We tried different phrases that we thought it was but nothing of the same happened.  Had to do something with ""Love"" and valentine's day but we were watching Locke and Key or October Faction on Netflix at the time. Anyone have a clue as a total mood takeover on Google Home/Assistant.  Luckily not too many things have randomly triggered Assistant responses, but this one was a takeover of our room."
"Hi,  I've got strange problems with two new JBL link 300 speakers. On both devices voice match doesn't work after setup. Sometimes it works after factory reset for a short time but after some hours voice match data seem to be lost somehow: ""I didn't recognize your voice....""  Of course I tried to delete and recreate voice match but without success.  Two Google home minis work withouts any problems in the same network."

I'm looking for space heaters that can be controlled with Google Assistant.  I'd like to be able to set it to go on and off at certain times. I've looked and don't see that specific feature with the space heater. I'm wondering if there are any that can be done with an app? Links would be helpful if you have them.
"Is there any way to do this?  It seems like it was an option once upon a time, but it was removed for some reason.  In my neck of the woods you'll get a $1000 fine and 4 demerits for even touching your phone while driving, but I kinda have to in order to unlock the damn screen to use voice commands.    Any workarounds are welcome."
"I'm trying to set up an assistant routine to close a set of apps that I use for my inventory etc at work. I add the voice command, but when I set it to close google sheets and the calculator, it ends up doing a google search for ""close calculator."" Am I not using the proper command for this?"
"My daughter really likes ***Taylor Swift - Shake it off***, but do you think I can get google assistant to play it? I've checked and the song is available on spotify. I've recorded a video to demonstrate:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxLz2LRKrnI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxLz2LRKrnI)"
"I'm on a phone with android 9 Pie and already have a google account linked.  Imagine you want to keep track of projects at work.    1.  ""Hey Google, Do Not Disturb""  (phone goes silent and the screen with the DND on/off slider button appears.  2.  ""Hey google, start project 12"".  (assistant then searches for it, but it doesn't matter since the phone is silent).  That's all there is to it.  When you want to see the list, click on your Avatar in the upper right, then ""Account"", ""Settings"".  You should see You, Assistant, Services and Home in a horizontal row, with You underlined.  Tap ""Your data in the assistant"" and the ""Your Recent Activity"" screen appears.  Scroll up and you'l see Said start project 12 with date and time.  Used google assistant Turning Do Not Disturb on underneath it.  Don't forget to turn DND off when done."
"Hi,  I've been struggling with this for quite sometime now. Every time I ask google assistant (either on my cellphone, google home or nest hub) to play ""U2"", it thinks that I'm saying ""YouTube"" and it can't play.  Not sure if it is my accent (since I'm from Brazil), but I have tried asking it different ways but never could get it to work.  Is it just me or does it happen to everyone? Is there a was to ask it so that it understand that I'm talking about the band?  Thanks"
"Even after hours of searching and trying out all of the solutions posted in Reddit and many other forums I still can't manage to ""ungrey"" the button for turning the option for waking up the search with voice command.

"I've been playing around with ""Tell me about &lt;x&gt;"" and having assistant read me articles.  But I've noticed that for longer articles, the voice will drop in volume after a certain time, and then just stop at a later point.    I'm assuming this is by design, but is there perhaps a setting or a way to extend these limits?"
"Hi there.  I added a new light source in the Hue app today and then tried to sync it with Google Home using the Google Assistant command ""Sync devices"". It does not work and I receive the message ""Can't reach Google at the moment"". I recently did a factory reset of my phone and before that I have not had any problems with syncing my devices in this way.  Does anyone know a possible fix?"
"My wife and I are at 37 weeks and fixing to introduce our little one to the world. I was trying to make a routine that as we were walking out the door to head to the hospital to text a list of people we wanted to let know it's ""go time"". I set the routine to trigger off the phrase ""It's Go Time"" then the assistant will send a text. I have added the ""send a text"" action 12 times and for each one set to send to a different number with roughly the same text. I have a Pixel 4 XL and when testing it will only send the text to the first 2 numbers then stop. I have tried making sure the number formats are the same but no matter what I do it will only send to the first 2 actions. the first message will send now issues the 2nd one will pop up a checkmark and x with a blue timer goes around the checkmark and sends once it's done but nothing more will happen. I would really like these messages to go out as individual text instead of a group message if possible! Any Ideas?"
"I was in my car today, 2009 Infiniti G37, and asked Assistant a question. From the phone itself I got results and Assistant read out some of them. At the same time that's happening I hear Assistant from one, just one, of my car speakers saying ""You are not connected to WiFi, I can't help you with that"".  This happened several times. What the heck is happening?  The phone connects to my car's Bluetooth automatically for phone calls. I've never heard it use the car speakers for anything else other than a phone call."
"If I ask ""how many grams in a pound,"" it sells me how to convert it, if I ask ""how many grams *are* in a pound,"" it tells me 453.92 grams are in a pound.  If I ask ""how make feet in a mile,"" it'll tell me 5280 feet, if I ask how many grams in an ounce, it'll tell me 28.35g.  I've tested multiple other conversions as well, and so far only the grams in a pound required me to say ""*are* in""  as opposed to just ""in."""
"Greetings,  I wish to use the Google assistant in my car with my phone mounted on my dash. The problem is the car vibrates so much that all the assistant hears is noise. It only works if I come to a complete stop. I can see the bars for input being maxed out with noise. But I have a bluetooth headset and the headset doesn't have such noise. I can invoke the assistant via bluetooth. However, the following command is subject to the noise as previously described. So I was curious if it was possible to disable the phone side of this equation, while leaving the bluetooth headset enabled?"
"Cooll thing I just experienced the other day: while driving I used GA to call my wife (car didn't have Bluetooth).  Me: Hey Google, call wife at home GA: Ok. Calling wife at home on speaker phone.  Did you see what happened there? GA knew I was driving so put the call on speaker phone without me telling it to. Cool!"
"So I've been trying to use Google Assistant almost exclusively to play music that is stored on my phone while driving. Since this is the Future^TM and all, it's certainly more convenient to say to my phone ""Okay Google, play &lt;song&gt;"" and have said stream through the Bluetooth on my car over pulling over and selecting the song manually.  My problem, however, is that Google Assistant doesn't always want to work this simply. I've already conditioned my phone to stop using Google Play Music as a default player by telling it to use something else (Rocket Player in my case) enough times. But sometimes it just cannot select the song right. Sometimes the Assistant tries to search for a song on the internet instead of defaulting to my library. Sometimes it finds the exact song (or album) I'm looking for, but doesn't start playing what it very clearly just found. Sometimes, stranger still, it hears me properly, tells me it's going to play some *other* song that's not in my library, and then plays exactly what I wanted it to in the first place. If I just want to listen to some music I already own, I don't need my phone trying to find something else that's not on my device. Is there a way to force Google Assistant to simplify its method of searching for music? I've looked through the settings and I can't find anything of the sort."
"Hi! Do you know if I can call REST request of localhost using Google Assistance?   I implemented an application that is able to do something with my computer. For example: when I send POST localhost:8080/open/google-chrome, then my computer open Google Chrome, and I want to call this POST using Google Assistance:   ""Ok Google, open Google Chrome on my computer"" -&gt; send request localhost:8080/open/google-chrome  I tried to use Dialogflow, but it needs a public server. Is there any way to do this? Maybe some action in IFTTT?"
"My wife and I both love having Google home mini's all around the house. We also love our Google pixel 3s. The problem is, we never use the voice assistant outside the house, and saying ""Ok, Google"" triggers our phones and disrupts our screens. I have revoked voice permission from Google, and yet somehow I still get a pop up on my phone says that my Google assistant is ready to be set up. So while it's not the assistant responding to me, clearly my phone will not stop listening to me, and that message still disrupts my screen usage when I say ""Ok Google"" to one of our mini's."
Am I the only one who hasn't got dark mode for Google Assistant or is it only certain phones that have received it?
" Hi all,  Recently picked up the GWA2 and have been happy so far. I decided to install the Google Assistant (using this guide from [9-5Google](https://9to5google.com/2019/07/19/google-assistant-samsung-galaxy-watch/) ) and for the most part it works great. I have noticed some of my queries are returned with ""Your Assistant Needs Permission to Help you with that"").  For example, I can ask, ""How far is it from Toronto to Mississauga?"" or ""when do the Toronto Maple Leafs play next?"" and GA returns a result, however, if I ask ""how high does a plane fly?"" or ""how much horsepower does a plane have?"" I get, your assistant needs permission to help you with that. [This article](https://forum.xda-developers.com/smartwatch/galaxy-watch/gassist-question-galaxy-watch-t3951204) describes my issue, and as per the OP the solution was to remove the watch from GA on phone and re-add.  I deleted and reinstalled the apps (both on phone and watch) and deleted all Google API configuration and then reconfigured it; with the same results. Also attempted to review all permissions etc.  Just curious if anyone else has experienced this issue and if i might be missing something in the permissions/configuration.  Thanks in advance!  \-This is:Nacho\_WiFi"

"My wife's name is Mackenzie. Whenever I use voice to text, her name is written out as McKenzie. This drives me nuts. Isn't there a way to have GA remember to always spell it the way I want it to? It's especially frustrating when I say Hey Google call Mackenzie or Hey Google WhatsApp Mackenzie and instead I get search results from the web because I don't have a McKenzie in my contacts. I have it trained to recognize who my wife is but asking for her by name is more natural and it just seems like it should be easy to have GA use only Mackenzie when I say her name."

"Google has added Auto punctuation to their Google assistant voice to text feature. That's all fine &amp; dandy Until you realize that some people don't talk quite as fast and that's a problem. If you pause in speech it puts a period, like it or not. If your voice even slightly has an upward inflection to it, you get a question mark inserted.  Also, doesn't appear to be a way to turn it off. Love the features Google but you got to give people options. Ugh. #damnitgoogle"

"As someone with a bad memory I've setup a number of reminders to help me keep reach of things. You know like take out the trash/recycling, renew a subscription, etc. Without a Google Home these just showed on my phone as notifications so I could track them easly.

"Hi there,  I'm trying to correlate the usage analytics that we're getting from our action with the logs that we get from stackdriver.  The Actions Console Analytics Usage page shows weekly unique users of around 400; the retention graph below it shows slightly different weekly unique users (usually around 20-40 more per week).  If I check our stackdriver logs, I can count about 50-60 unique logged in users per week and 100-150 cancelled sign ins (some of which are not unique but difficult to dedup).  So I'm somehow missing more than half of the users that the Actions Console is reporting!  Can anyone help me find where Google is seeing them?  Thank you!"
"I say Hey google, I have it set to work when the screen is off. It is just fine, it starts playing a song for me.  But then assistant does not hear hey google at all.

"Why doesn't anything work with Google assistant?

It I'm in my room with a Google home I don't want my phone to pop up with assistant because why the fuck would I? You can't set a default response speaker, just playback and speaker groups are a joke. Half the time they break and you need to reinstall the app. The other half the audio cuts out after 25 minutes of streaming Spotify. There is no way to use a speakergroup as a Chromecast speaker even though you can ADD a Chromecast device to a speakergroup. my chinsy iot devices dc every once and a while cuz y not. I tried so hard to like the Google assistant and home lineup since Alexa is its own unique pile of dog shit but how can Google not even make a functional app for one of their flagship products"

The one for tomorrow at 6am, the one for tomorrow at 630am, or the one for tomorrow at 7am?  &gt; **Me:** ""All of them""  &gt; **Assistant:** ""Okay, it looks like you have set 3 alarms, which do you want to cancel?

"Does anyone here use the assistant to wake them up? I find that the second I hear it's voice in the morning, it pisses me off 10x more than an alarm clock.  I'm wondering if it's because I tend to get less than ideal hours, and usually my phone is right beside me, so it's like another human talking in my ear.   I like the idea of using it, and what she offers, but wanted to know whether it's like this for everyone."
"Hi. How do you tell Google Assistant / Maps to navigate to a place in a foreign language? Even if I pronounce the place correctly, it, if course, understands something weird.

Here as some things I would like to get working:  * Create a new list called Inbox * Add ""wash the car"" to the Inbox list * What lists do I have? * What's on my Inbox list? * Remove ""wash the car"" from my list  A combination with reminders or due dates would also be nice.

Long story short: It is *slow* and it has begun to give up on us. Also, vTuner suddenly wants a payed subscription to play web radio.  My idea: A voice controlled device to save time (change radio channels takes quite some time in the Marantz) and to be more flexible.

I’m in double digits by now, I don’t need it to keep telling me about the integration. There should be a limit to this. There are dozens of Assistant PMs at Google, someone prioritize a rate limit on this please."
"Pretty specific issue but hoping someone else has had this issue and found a fix.  I have a 2018 F-150 with Ford Sync 3. I use text dictation on Google assistant a lot with no issues (99% accuracy), but when I am on Bluetooth, the assistant listens through the car microphone, and for some reason everything breaks down: lag on dictation, wrong dictation (hilariously bad, actually...) , can't get directions reliably, places calls to wrong person etc.   The weird part is that there are no issues with phone calls over the car mic (I've tested and people say it doesn't even sound like I'm driving) so it seems to be something with the way that the Sync 3 is transferring the audio to the assistant.   Right now, the only work around is to shut off Bluetooth to use the assistant, but then I lose voice calls and music etc, obviously.  What I want to do is find a way for the assistant to listen on the phone mic, while other apps work over Bluetooth as normal (phone, spotify etc.). I seem to remember there was an Android setting to do this like ages ago, but I can't find it...  Any help is appreciated!"

"For things I do several times a day a simple ""OK"" or just the action would be fine. ""Hey Google lights on please"", gets a long description of what's going to happen.

"Hi, could someone explain to me why Voice Match controls work fine on the GH, but on the phone, it's a whole different story?  I can dim the lights on the GH fine, by saying 'Dim the lights' for example and turns 'my room' lights off, but when I try it on my Pixel, it acts dumb and turns off all the lights in my home.  Makes no sense at all, extremely frustrating to say the least.  Thanks"

"(Google Home Mini / Lenovo Chromebook S330 / Pixel 3)  Somebody please help me out here.  I'm at my wit's end.  No matter what I do, device restarts, settings changes, ANYTHING, I cannot for the life of me get my Home Mini's to answer voice commands anymore.  They used to, with no problem at all.  Now, if I try to do something simple like ""Hey Google, set an alarm"", very intentionally meaning for the speakers to hear it and for my phone \*NOT\* to, the speakers do nothing.  Instead, the phone goes ""For that, you'll need to unlock your device"".  Sooooooooooo......I spent $100 on two voice controlled speakers and I'm STILL stuck using my phone as an alarm?  Not okay.  I did this very intentionally because it's too easy to press snooze on the phone.  Somebody please help me figure this out, I'm begging you, because I've been oversleeping alarms and missing appointments for months and I'm just about ready to light all of my Google hardware on fire and start throwing it at people."

"Hey guys, was trying to make a reservation and noticed that Google Assistant, for the first time I've seen, actually offered to call the restaurant for me to make a res! Pretty awesome.  5 minutes later and it confirmed the res was made. However, I'm really curious to hear the phone call. Also don't want to show up and they have no reservation and I have to sound like a weirdo and say my ""assistant"" called for me haha.  Anyway to find and listen to the reservation call recording?"
Is there a way to use Google assist to open an app on my phone and then select multiple buttons within that app?  I'm wondering if I can ask Google assist whilst I'm driving to 'open the gates' and it then open the correct app on my phone and select the lock button then the front gate button?

I hope you are able to do the same!

"Has anyone else noticed recently if you say ""please"" at the end of a command, the GA will now praise you for asking nicely?

"I am used to setting up little reminders by saying ""Ok Google, Remind me to call the doctor"" and so on. But I am trying to get re-organised within the google world and trying to switch to Google Tasks.

"I'm constantly losing my phone in a bunch of stuff but I know it can hear me. But I can't find the correct words to make it start making some loud noises to help me find it easier.  What is the command? Is there one?  Currently, I just keep saying ""hey google, hey google hey google"" and it makes the short blip noise.  I'm looking for a command that will make it go crazy, maybe like a siren."
"I would kinda want Google Assistant to have setting for sarcasm level.. like a switch or a scale you can set it.

"I can't turn off my Android TV from TCL with a voice command from my phone, but opening apps etc is working fine and turning the TV off with the remote control works just fine. I just did a factory reset in the hope of getting it to work, unfortunately that worked as you can see.  Anybody got an idea on how to fix this? Tried Google already but found no working answer."
"I know this isn't the worst issue in the world, but if someone has a fix I'd be grateful...   When I set a timer with Assistant she starts the timer in the background but instead of opening the timer app and showing the timer, the mic symbol turns into to a spinning wheel and then the assistant just stays open until I swipe home. I just want to set a timer and then immediately see it counting down, like it used to be.   Anyone else?"
"Unlike others in this sub I have no interest in using Google Assistant atm. However I have tried just about everything I could think of to disable it, but it still chimes in without provocation whenever I have something connected via the headphone jack. I've read in various forums that others have had the same problem when connecting their Android devices to their car audio systems using the headphone jack where the assistant interrupts the vocalization of the turn by turn directions, podcasts and music even after disabling Google Assistant.    For some reason even after disabling Google Assistant and removing all of the Google app's permissions Google Assiatnt insists on repeatedly breaking into whatever audio is being transmitted via the headphone jack to suggest that I should re-enable Google Assistant (as if I were too stupid to figure it out and hadn't purposefully disabled it). From what I've seen no one has apparently found an effective solution or workaround for this extreme annoyance.   The Google app is included by default on the OEM image used for both of my Android devices and embedded Google apps are not removable via Android settings and some other Google app or service will likely break if I did manage to remove the Google app by using ADB.  Any help is appreciated."
"1.  noticed that creating schedules ends in an endless loop of the assistant asking for WHEN the item is due. 2. Playing the `Liked Songs` playlist on Youtube music fails, sometimes playing any playlist (personal) at all fails, though `my` is explicitly included in the request, the assistant plays random shit instead. 3. Giving a song a thumbs up/down in either Google Play Music and Youtube Music fails. 4. Playing Music now always requires unlocking my device, even playing another song when music is already playing. 5. Starting the vacuum has a 40:40 chance of getting lectured about vacuums or the vacuum stating a cleanup there is also a 20% chance of NOTHING happening at all :-). 6. asking for the status of the vacuum only works when it is cleaning in other cases the assistant replies that it cannot do this yet. 7. starting navigation to a contact item is not possible 90% of the time."
"I have been trying to find a way to trigger a Google Home Routine someway with my Alexa set up. The back story is I am able to create a routine with my roku tv and Xbox to say “Play Fifa” or “Play Modern Warfare” and it will turn on my tv, change the input, turn on my Xbox and launch the game. Alexa routines can not mimic voice commands so I can’t chain commands together in this fashion like I can with Google.   That being said, I also don’t want to go out and get a bunch of google assistant hubs for my setup because I already have several echo devices in my house.   Is there any way to trigger a google routine without using google home or google assistant? I’ve done research online with IFTTT and webhooks and haven’t been able to find anything."
"So my phone updated to android 10 today. I was happy but my assistant didn't adapt right away. It was still the android 9 assistant. Now I used it few minutes ago and suddenly it started to give me a tour of the android 10 features. I accidentally closed it during this process and it stayed on the android 9 assistant. It was introducing me to the corner swipe feature but now it doesn't work, same with other features that were supposed to come with the A10 update. It doesn't seem to want to give me the introduction again. Am I stuck with the old assistant?"

"Hey everyone. I'm having some trouble with the Google Assistant and I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong, or if this is just the normal behavior.        I have several playlists of music in my YouTube account. I'd like to be able to, for example, have a playlist called ""Jazz"" and then be able to tell the Google Assistant to ""play my Jazz playlist"" and have it do just that. Unfortunately, it's not working like that at all right now, and the Google Assistant instead starts playing some random video or radio station that might share a keyword from the playlist title.         Is there any way to access my own music playlists via the Google Assistant?       I should note that these playlists are made in regular YouTube, not YouTube Music, so some of them include longer compilations/mixes or album rips, and not just individual songs. I know the YouTube Music app/service can be finicky about what it recognizes as 'music'.        Anybody have any advice?"

"As the title says, i recently upgraded my OS to have android 10. Since then, i have been having issues with assistant all the time The two major problems are: 1. Everytime i ask assistant to play music (Spotify) it always plays the same song and I can't find a command to say so the assistant plays random music from the list i downloaded. 2. My phone is supposed to be unlocked while in the car using smart lock function, but now it sometimes stays unlocked and sometimes asks me to unlock it before doing what i asked for.  At first i thought it was my phone ( OnePlus 6T) and its recent update to be the problem, but i get the same issues in my Google home mini that i recently got.  I would appreciate if you know something that might help to solve these issues because they're driving me insane specially when they didn't exist"
I used to be able to do this with my OnePlus 3T but I can't seem to find the setting on my 7T.

"I want to know if it's possible to make routines that:  &amp;nbsp;   1) Can have multiple stages, and  &amp;nbsp;   2) Do different things based on how the user responds  &amp;nbsp;   So for example if I wanted to have my assistant give me helpful medication reminders, it'd be ideal if I could have it first remind me to take them, and then 15 minutes later follow-up and ask if I have taken them.   Then if I reply ""Yes"" the routine ends, but if I reply ""No"" it reminds me again and then does the 15 minute wait again.   I'd be happy to do some integration with stringify and/or ifttt if necessary, but it'd be great if I could get some idea from people who are more knowledgeable whether the idea is at all doable in the first place :)"

"Today when I was playing with my Google Home Assistant, I asked it to entertain me to which she answered me something with Forrest (I don't remember the details, but it only gave me one option). Then she asked me which one of the given options I wanted to try. I told it ""the only one you gave me"". It answered in an different more serious and pretty scary voice, ""ok only one"" and after that it kept the voice and told me I needed to log in, whatever I said to it it keep saying to me that I needed to log in. So I told her to log me in, and it told me that it needed all my information for confirmation of my Identity, and that all that information will be visible to all members of the ""Only One community"".

"I have a couple of questions when it comes to routines.  So I recently found out that when you ask Google to play ambient sounds it auto repeats. I've been asking it to loop ambient sounds for a while until I found out. Then I figured out that I can add ambient sounds to my bedtime routine. It sucks that it won't do a random one like it does when i ask it to play ambient sounds but whatever, hate the fan one anyway.  My problem is I can't get it to loop automatically when I do my routine, it just plays the sound for an hour or so. Is there a way to get it to loop without saying ""hey Google put on loop""?  I also noticed that when I set up this routine or ask Google to play ambient sounds on my hub it shows the music screen with the play button and such, even though I have it set up that when it's dark in my room it should just show my clock. Is there anyway to fix this without reaching over and swiping left?"

"I've read some articles about the unveiling of Google Home's new Ambient Mode (do not confuse it with Chromecast's Ambient Mode) that is available on 2 Lenovo tablets / Nokia devices.  I've also read that this feature is slowly becoming available for more select android devices.  I understand that it's an ""always on"" state that can show ur pictures, take assistant commands, have some smart home related buttons on the screen and is somewhat comparable to Google's Smart Display products.  But I would like to know more about it, (considering Google did not make any official announcement about it) particularly if the tablet that has Ambient Mode enabled can also be used a like a Chromecast, as in: can you tell it to play (or cast to it) the services that you linked to your account? (such as Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, etc)  Thanks to all that will help me satisfy this curiosity, as I'm really thinking of buying such a tablet, but would also really like it to act as the Kitchen's ""Chromecast device"" too."
"Hello! I was hoping to find a solution to a problem I am having. It appears to be a Google Assistant problem with Andriod Auto. While driving, I use the Mic button on the steering wheel to give voice commands to my Samsung Galaxy s10e. (Such as ""Call Mom"" or ""Take me to Outback Steakhouse."") I have never had any problem with it until today when I tried to use the button, Google Assistant came up with a verbal message of ""When it's safe, you'll need to tap on the notification first to use Google Assistant while driving."" I got this message multiple times, even after tapping the notification. Anyone else getting this?! It's infuriating and defeats the purpose of using Google Assistant while driving because I still have to mess with my phone while driving. I used the feature quite often, so if anyone has a fix, please advise!!   Some other details: Phone is a Samsung Galaxy s10e. Car is a 2019 Subaru Crosstrek, with Android Auto.

I’d like to be able to just quickly Bluetooth connect various devices without setting up Google Assistant/Home, as I don’t really have other devices that use this and I don’t really like the lack of security involved with it (ie. the chance of it listening all the time).

Click on the text of any task. You should get a cursor on it but the list should still be shown (not the individual task). This puts the task list as the sole focus for printing so that your emails are not included in the next step 3. If you want to bring your Completed tasks as well, expand the Completed section now 4. Print (ctrl-p on Windows)    1. More settings    2. Destination: Save as PDF    3. Scale: Custom, and whatever value works to fit it all on one page. I used 20    4. Tabloid paper size may help if you have a really long list    5. Save 5. Open the PDF and select task items only and copy (Ctrl-C on Windows) 6. Paste into a text editor, wordpad will do fine 7. Use Find / Replace to remove the weird character and the space in from of each item 8. Select all and copy 9. Paste into a new or existing list in Keep"
Sorry if this is widely known. I just got a home mini and drunkenly like to shout things at it.
"I thought I'd put together a routine for going home from Work. ""Hey Google, take me home"". Tells me the first appointment for tomorrow, sends a text to a phone number, then navigates to my home address.  When I use it, it sends the text to a completely different number. Any ideas what's happening here?"
It now starts up some random radio station. I'm not subscribed by the way. It worked just fine earlier this week.

"I have season tickets to a local sports team and going into the Ticketmaster website or app and saving the tickets too Google Pay is kind of a pain in the butt (I know, first world problems...). Is there any way to integrate Ticketmaster with Google Assistant so that the tickets are automatically downloaded to Google Pay?"
"It's way faster, and either way it will either hear you or it won't and you'll need to repeat yourself.     I know a lot of people already know this, but I still see most people saying ""hey google"" then waiting, then giving their command."
"I've recently switched to Google Keep for notes and list integration but this was happening prior.  Every time I try to add something to either my 'Books' or 'Movies' list, it tells me that its doing that - but it calls me by my old name.  ""Ok Matty, adding xxxx to your books list""  ""Ok Matty, adding xxxx to your movies list""  &amp;#x200B;  I can't view these lists. They're not in 'view all my lists' or [shoppinglist.google.com](https://shoppinglist.google.com)  All other lists work fine with Google Keep and I'm able to use alternate names (like 'reading' list) but would rather use these two names.  Any ideas?"
"So I got the new Notes &amp; Lists function a few days ago and updated mine to use Keep. It's been working great so far from phone and Home, but yesterday on my way to the store I added a few more items via Android Auto. When I arrived I thought my list looked a little sparse, then opened the Google Shopping list in order to make sure my kids hadn't added anything to it pre-switch, and lo and behold, there were all the items from my drive.  Anyone else able to confirm this behavior?"
I would like to make routine like the movie time one.  The goodnight one would be cool also.  Does anyone know if this possible in the google ecosystem.  &amp;#x200B;   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJY3eP7Kb-c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJY3eP7Kb-c)   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks
"I really prefer to keep the voice match on the phone, but it's proving extremely annoying at home - specially when I have my google mini's around - every time i issue a command for the mini, the phone will also wake with a loud ding sound. Worst at night... the screen lights up bright - when i want to issue a command silently to the mini bedside. Is there any options to turn the sound off on the phone?"
"I'm perplexed with a custom routine I wrote to navigate.  I sometimes am sent to other facilities and don't always work in the same location, so I am trying to make a custom routine instead of the modifying the prebuilt ""work"" routine.  Anyway, I have run into the problem of my routine failing after asking to ""turn on gps"".  The routine will stop and any steps afterwards never happen.  To workaround this issue, I removed that command (since I usually don't turn the GPS off for geofencing, anyway) but now I am having the same failure with the ""Navigate to XXX"" command.  The navigation in GM will start, but the routine fails to run anything after that.  I have moved it to the bottom of the list, but it would be nice to not have it at the bottom, and for it to start playing music as requested."
"Hello, I've recently bought a Redmi Note 8, and in the Google app, the option to access with voice match is greyed out and underneath reads ""This feature is currently unavailable for this language"" but my language is set to English (US) so I don't understand.

"On my galaxy s7 this option is greyed out. No explanation, not possible turn it on, simply nothing🤣 What do i do ?"
"I'm cautiously thrilled that it's possible to use Keep with Assistant again. But, it's not available for me in Assistant settings/Services yet. I imagine three possible reasons for that; 1. It's a server side update that I just have to wait for. 2. It's not available in the UK yet. 3. It simply won't be available for my GSuite account.  Has anyone gotten this work work with a GSuite account and/or in the UK?  Thanks!"

"So far I've got to ""Kay goobla""."
The Google assistant ad on YouTube and TV always manages to set off the voice commands for Android enabled devices. It tends to be more of an annoyance than a advertisement.
Howdy   Is there a voice command to share my trip progress with someone? Tried a few options but keep getting the sorry message. Seems silly and unsafe that I have to touch the screen while driving.
"Having this service was WHY I bought my google homes. Its been like 3 years now since it has been removed and I hardly use them. Already today, going through my fridge while making dinner I can just say ""Ok Google add shredded cheese to my Costco Shopping List"" and its there, I can follow up and say ""remind me tomorrow at 12pm to go to Costco"". Then, tomorrow when I get to Costco I can have my notes automatically pull up since I have it GeoTagged for Costco.   I am a super forgetful person. This makes keeping my lists update so much easier, and will be what I use my Assistant for 90% of the time.  Hope you all have it, but it should be there as it seems it was a server side update."
"I was notified today that I've been added to the beta program for G-suite w/Assistant.  If anyone has any questions or things they'd like me to try with assistant, let me know.

I figured out I can say ""send an e-mail to me"" to mail a note to myself without having to use the assistant-only list feature, which I've never cared for.

It understands me and sometimes gives voice follow-up but it just doesn't respond after that and doesn't start the action.  I tried literally everything:  * Uninstall app updates * Disable and re-enable Assistant * Factory reset Pixel * Tried a different smartphone, same problem * Deleted everything in My Activity * Toggled every possible privacy setting in my account * Switched languages * Created a dummy account, where everything worked fine  Some weird things:  * It does respond to more complex commands like 'set a reminder' or 'play music'. * It does respond to commands through my Wear OS watch and my wireless earbuds. * When I disable Web Activity, it does respond to 'set a timer'.

"Hi! I have a Pixel 4 XL and live in Hungary. So the GA is not available here, at all. But I noticed something strange. On nov. 20 I bought Express VPN, just to play with it, because it was on sale. Set it to USA, later Germany. Set it to default, later split tunneling for Google App and Instagram only. Meanwhile I always use the latest beta versions of the Google App. I think I also set the system language to English, to tune my Good Morning routine. (I have a few Google speakers (Home, Nest minis) at home). After a few minutes or hours, I noticed that the Assistant icon is still on the dock's search bar, it did not change back to the voice icon. So I tried, and suprise suprise, the (new, compact) Assistant still worked with Hungarian system language (but ofc in English). And it worked for almost 3 weeks. Yesterday I fed up with a few hiccups and freezes, so I made a factory reset. Only after that I realized the Assistant doesn't come back, even if I restore every VPN settings or playing with the system language. So my main question is does anyone have a tip what did I do? How did I enable the GA? Or it was just a bug in that versions of Google App which let me use it? Or just a fatal accident? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"

I still hear the music coming from the other room (it’s not a big apartment) but can only hear it from the nearby speaker when putting my ear up to it.   Also if start playing music on apartment from the living room, the living room speaker will answer a question even if I ask it to a google home in another room.

Asking Assistant to play the Frozen 2 soundtrack brings up the Spanish version.  Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is this an issue with Google Assistant or Spotify?"
"As of about three days ago, Google assistant can no longer add to the shopping list on any of my devices.   I've tried on all 6 around my house and even the assistant app on my phone. I get ""Sorry, something went wrong while I was looking for that"".   I can't find any recent articles about changes to Shopping List that might've affected this (like when it was moved from Keep).   It's a feature I use everyday.

"Hello everyone,  as I just was checking the Google Home app whether it's now finally possible to use Keep for the shopping list, I came up with an idea. And as Google's feedback system is pure garbage and no one is following me on Twitter, I figured I'd be best to share the idea here. Maybe I'm lucky and it's not only good but also reaches someone at Google.  ***TL;DR per-user customized sorting of shopping lists through ML***  The starting point of my idea was that got annoyed by sorting my shopping list myself in order to go shopping time efficiently. So my first thought was to order the items on the list according to its types, as most stores are built up the same – groceries first, snacks and alcohol last. But as I'm not sure whether this is actually the case and sometimes, users might also have habits such as buying different products in different stores, the better way implementing such an functionality would be learning the correct order of the shopping list items through the order in which users check them off while shopping.   This would of course also work for the current web-based shopping list managed through Google Assistant. Keep would just be nice to have.  I'd love to get some feedback on this.  Cheers!"

"So, first of I don't flame do know anything about the topic. Just want to share my experience and get some answers from someone who is more knowledgeable than me. I've been trying to get my Google assistant to give me replies faster, it just speaks too slow. I've searched for the option to regulate voce speed but there doesn't seem to be be one. Somehow it ends up recommending me to turn on additional features in order to get ""the full assistant experience"" It boils down to me allowing Google to collect data about my contact and the frequency of me using them. Than there is the option to analize the content on my screen and store it, in order to make it easyer for them to assist me. Someone told me that I need to enable this in order for the assistant to speak at a normal pace. I don't feel comfortable sharing this data with Google thus I dident turn it on. Can someone verify that in fact it would fix my problem or is this just a theory. Thank you."
"I set up a routine to play my playlist called Fire Mixtape in Apple Music, but it always plays Neil levin's fire mixtape album.

"I have the Bedtime routine enabled, been using it for months. The last item in the routine is to play thunderstorm noise, which normally stops after 60 minutes. The past two nights, I've woken up 4 to 7 hours later to discover the sounds are still playing on my Google Hub. The screen has reverted to the time display, as it normally does when the sounds end, but the sounds are still playing. ""Hey Google, stop"" shuts it down, but I'd like to figure out what's going on.   The routine hasn't been altered; there's no place for me to change the duration of the playback anyway.

"This happens to us both in the car with Android Auto and at home using the phone's assistant. I can say, ""Stream The Fish Atlanta"" and 104.7 will immediately start playing via iHeartRadio. However, when I say ""Stream KLOVE"" or ""Stream KLOVE on iHeartRadio,"" it either tunes in the wrong station (despite confirming the station's name) or doesn't play at all. I have to manually play the station in the iHeartRadio app and then cast it to the speaker when we're home. I can't figure out why the other iHeartRadio stations work great, but K-LOVE is too much for the assistant to handle. Any ideas?"

If Google is serious about making YouTube Music the main music app then shouldn't they be making it the default for the assistant? It works but it's not perfect. I feel that I should be able to ask it to play a specific playlist it even the new recommended playlist it makes for you. Even saying something like play offline songs would be really nice. Hope I'm not the only one.
"I swear I did this last week but not working anymore.  I have a bunch of nest cameras and a hello doorbell.  When I say, ""hey Google show me my front door camera"" it responds with, "" sorry I don't know how to do that yet""  If I ask assistant the same question on my phone it follow up by asking me which screen to display the camera on but never works.  Can't we simply ask to see the camera on the hub max display?"
"Hi, after using a google home mini for a few years, we've been considering upgrading to a Google Home. While out shopping today, we instead opted for the Bose 500 with Google Assistant. We've got it all set up and plugged in and the sound quality is great, except the google assistant implementation so far seems to be pretty horrendous.  With the Google Home Mini, if we say 'OK Google' while at home, the output would always go to the google home mini. Now, we seem to get mixed results. In all cases, both my phone and the bose will 'listen', while in most cases the output goes to my phone. In some cases, it goes to both my phone and the bose, while in rare cases it goes straight to the bose (and in those instances, my phone will say 'answering on another device').  In addition to this, in the few instances where we've had the output go to the bose, including some tests where I turned my phone off to force the output to the bose, the response time is just disgusting. On the google home mini, we would have a response in 2-3 seconds. On the bose, we're waiting upwards of 15+ seconds.  This all might seem a little trivial - after-all, what difference does it make if I get the same answer on my phone as I would have gotten on the Bose? Well, if I say 'OK Google, play Cubicolour' I kind of want it to play on my speaker, not on my phone. If I then need to pick up my phone, go into spotify and change the output device, then what's the point of even having Google Assistant on a speaker in the first place?  Is this a known issue with Google Assistant on third party speakers where assistant is just much better on Google Home devices i.e. akin Chromecast being far superior to Chromecast Built-in, or is this likely to be down to how Bose have implemented Google Assistant into their hardware? Are these known issues with known fixes? I obviously did a bit of googling before coming to reddit, but could only find a Google help article that specifically caters to Google Home devices, which essentially says as long as the phone and home device are connected to the same account, the home device should provide the output.  Would be grateful for any advice here as we're on the brink of either taking it back, or just switching from Google Assistant to Alexa instead."
"Hey guys I need help with Google Assistant on my Android phone (OnePlus 7T Pro). When I set my phone language to Slovenian, I can only use Google Search and not Voice commands for controling my smart light even when I speak in English (since Slovenian is not supported). I already switched everything in Google Assistant to English (even removed Slovenian), but it seems like the system wide language settings overides the Google Assistant Voice settings.   So to clarify, when I have Slovenian language as system wide language and say ""turn on the lights"" it will just search for that term in the Google web search. But if I set it to English as system wide language, then I can say ""turn on the lights"" and Google Assistant responds with OK and turns the smart light on.   Does anyone know a workaround for that? Thanks for help!"

"Hello everyone. Today a notification from Google app popped up on my phone suggesting that I could keep my assistant on while my phone is charging, so that I could easily access it with ""ok Google"" phrase and so that my assistant could display todays events or even various images from my Google Photos. Curious to see how all this would look like I decided to enable some of these new features, despite the fact that Google Assistant, as a standalone app, is not available in my country. The result is following: though I have not tested the aforementioned features, I quickly noticed that my screen is not turning off while my phone is locked and charging. Whenever 30 seconds passes, it swiftly turns off and back on again. Luckily, my lock screen background is completely black but I would nevertheless try to switch off these new features in order to save some electricity and in order to not have a shining screen in the room whenever I'm charging my phone. I tried to find the way to turn this things off but I just cannot find any option to disable these features, not in the Google app nor anywhere else in phone settings.  My phone is Pocofone F1 and it runs MIUi in case that matters.. Usually I have no problem navigating through the phone options and enable and disabling stuff, but this thing is driving me crazy and I really don't know where can I try to find the solution to my current problem. It appears as if this set of features came out of nowhere and wad offered to me by Google who was unaware that I cannot access the standalone Google Assistant app though I am on Android Pi. TLDR: got a notification from Google to keep my  assistant on while my phone is charging. Ever since then I cannot turn off my phone screen while the phone is charging. Hope you guys can help me :l"
"As title, i have a oneplus 7t and i'm new to android. I'm quite sure some weeks ago i was able to read and answer messages from whatsapp via Google assistant, but now if i Say ""read my messages"" It Just shows some 3rd party app. What am i missing?"
"So, I tell Google Assistant to set a reminder for whenever, she says ""Ok, I'll remind you to  \*\*\* tomorrow at \*\*\*"".  The thing is, if I go to Show Reminders, there's nothing there and it also won't remind me of anything.  I'l tried clearing the cache, clearing data, reinstalling updates and everything else I could find on Google. I'm all out of ideas.  Using a Xiaomi Mi6 with MiUI 11, if it's any help."

"I seriously want to kill the people for customising adds and making them follow me on every page which then moves everything I'm reading down 5cm every 5 secs for the first 2 mins of every page I use.

"I'm on Galaxy S10e unlocked, not beta.   When trying to send a text using Google Assistant, it goes all the way to asking me what I want to send. It then takes that voice input as a question. For example, if I want to text ""hello"", Google will just respond by saying, ""hi, how can I help?""  It won't send the text. It won't do anything. Does anyone know how to fix this, or have any ideas?"
"I have the Xaomi mi 9 phone and Google assistant work perfectly for a few months.  Now after giving the 2nd command, it will just sit and think until time out.   After 2 minutes it resets back to normal.  It's quite frustrating as I can't use assistant to control YouTube anymore.  Any ideas?"
"For others it always reads out ""these came back from a search"". It's so annoying.  Unless! I'm navigating Maps. I find higher success with it reading out the results for me.  Is there a solution? It'd be great if the assistant can read out anything which is the first link"
"Hi all, I have a problem: when I ask Google Assistant to call a contact, he replies in this way by saying: ""to continue you must activate web and app activities"", but  in the settings menu everything is all active.

Thanks.   p.s.  if I click ""continue"" nothing happens 😂  https://preview.redd.it/4osnsy2y2tz31.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8557015458dfde9c6deefbe666a32ccb683d6c2b"
"I just set up my old nexus 7 tablet as a home automation panel in my kitchen and it works great. When I said ""ok google. What is the weather?"" It answered and all good.  I asked something else and all of a sudden the assistant in the living room google home took over.  Is there a way to ensure the nearest assistant answer or can I have one respond only to ""ok Google"" and another respond to ""hey google""?"
"WHY TF CAN'T GOOGLE ASSISTANT SET MY PHILLIPS HUE LIGHTS NORMAL. ""hey google, set my lights to normal"" ""sorry, i dont know how to that yet"". Okei then set my lights to white. *Sets lights to the brightest white, 10 000 lumins, yeah thats realy not really what i wanted. PLEASE JUST SET IT TO NORMAL YELLOW WHITE ISH COLOR. HOW TF ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO CONTROL YOUR LIGHTS BACK REGULAR LIGHTS JUST BY USING YOUR ASSISTANT? CAN I SPEAK TO YOU MANAGER OR LARRY FUCKING PAGE FOR THAT MATTER. im sorry but it doesnt get more stupid than this."
"The obvious ones are Spotify, read me the news. What hidden gems have you found we should try?"
"Was having issues with SiriusXM on my Home. Tried unlinking then relinking my account in Assistant and it says either user or password is incorrect, HOWEVER, I can successfully sign in and out of the Sirius official app with it so I know it's correct.  Anyone else having issues? Shotty rollout if you ask me. Sometimes have issues requesting stations if I don't say the name exactly as listed either."
"In the standard ""good night"" routine (run from phone) I added ""open spotify"" and ""open stitcher"".   This works fine.  GA opens the 2 apps and continues the routine.  In the standard ""good morning"" routine I added ""open chrome"" and ""open reddit"". These *do* open but the opened app remains in focus and I have to manually bring GA back into focus for routine to continue.  What explains this?  Is this behavior driven by differences between apps or something else? It pretty much defeats the point of routines (or automation in general) if I have to do things manually!"
"So I've been planning to switch back to Google Assistant from Cortana on my Android 9 device due to news that Microsoft will shut down Cortana next year. However, I have no idea how to connect the Microsoft To-Do app to Google Assistant.   I'd like to use the Microsoft To-Do app because when I tell my voice assistant on my Macbook, PC (or with Cortana on Android, the phone) to remind me to do something, the reminders pop-up on all three devices. I also do not want to use Google Reminders on the devices because the notifications always arrive 10-60 minutes late. However, I can not find the setting anywhere on the phone to change the default reminder app.   Microsoft tells me to   &gt;"" To use voice commands with Microsoft To Do on Android, just tap the mic from the Google search bar, say 'Ok Google, add a note...' and select Microsoft To Do as your default app. ""  which completely doesn't work because it just replies ""Sure, what's the note?""  Does anyone have any ideas?"

"Do you guys have as much trouble as me setting location based reminders ?  As far as I know, there are only one way of setting location based reminders right now, using Google search bar and typing ""Add a reminder"" (or using the reminders view hidden deeeep inside Google App &gt; Plus menu), then using the card UI allowing use to set a location. But even there, taping the round confirm button gives no feedback if the reminder was set or not. There's just a loading spinner around the button..  Then nothing. It does set the reminder but is adding a toast saying ""Reminder was set"" too much to ask ? I mean come on Google. This is basic UX.  And I seem to remember that we could set location based reminders using Google Assistant, but that does not work for me anymore. I can use the ""Add a reminder"" command that asks questions about what I want to set but won't ask any question nor react to location queries, or using the full voice command to set all in once, but that doesn't work anymore. This really sucks. I love the Assistant but having that much trouble for such a simple query makes me mad."

"I just recently bought a Google Home that I use for my bedroom and I've been using it often as a part of my morning routine. One thing that I've grown kinda frustrated over is its inability to read from my separate calendars i.e. My ""Work Schedules"" calendar and my ""Important Events"" calendar I was wondering if there was some way Assistant could read my ""Work Schedules"" calendar just by simply saying ""When do I work next"" I tried making a custom routine to do so but no matter what I tried Assistant doesn't wanna separate my calendars so it'll just end up spouting off the next event I have marked down on either of them. Next up I was wondering if there was some way to format the response in a way so it seems more conversational. Rather than ""Your next event is \[Event Name\] at \[Event Time\]"" if I can get a response like ""You work tonight at \[Event Start\] to \[Event End\]"" I would like to integrate this with my ""Good Morning"" routine I already have set up. I figure I might have to tinker around a bit with the Assistant SDK which I have very minimal knowledge on so if anyone has any helpful advice or tips I would appreciate it."
I have a GPM and YTM music subscription and I like for my music playlists to be separate from my main YouTube profile.  I created a brand account linked to my main email to use for this.  Can I set my Assistant to use that brand account over my main email? (I use a Google Home for a lot of music)
"Hi, I'm new to GA, use mostly through Android Auto. I tweaked some Google Assistant settings on my phone, and suddenly I'm getting the ""Let me get that info for you"" response, then nothing. For example, I used to say ""Text my wife"" and it would work every time. Now, 9 times out of 10, I say the same thing and Google blows me off. Yelling at GA doesn't seem to work. The settings I tweaked shouldn't have affected GA's ability to reply, so I'm wondering if I screwed something up, or if this buggy GA behavior. Thanks!"
"I don't understand why this continues to happen. I've been using the Google Assistant on my phone with no issues for years, and now this happens on a regular basis.  When I try to execute a known working command, I get a screen that says ""Get Started"" and it says ""Ok, but I'll need to get some more information"". When I click, it takes me to another screen where I after scrolling down, I can ""Turn on"". It then executes the Google Assistant, waiting for a command.  I repeat my command and it again asks me to ""Get Started""."

"I've got a phone with Google Assistant and also a Google Home Mini at home. My Google Home Mini works fine but Google Assistant on my phone only responds to ""Hey Google"" when I'm physically at home. If I'm away from home then it doesn't respond at all, even if the phone is unlocked and sitting at the home screen. If I press and hold the home button on my phone then Google Assistant activates ok, but I want to start it with my voice.  I vaguely remember when I set up the Google Home Mini that there was a question that asked about when Google Assistant should activate on my phome, but I can't remember what the question was or how I answered it (and I might be remembering incorrectly anyway).  Has anyone else seen this problem or have a solution that allows me to activatee Google Assistant with my voice on my phone when I'm away from home?"

"Hi all,  Until recently, i could activate or deactivate my wifi sockets through google assistant without having to unlock my android phone...  Then an update removed the ability to turn things on without unlocking...and the most recent update - now I have to unlock the phone to turn things off too.  Does anyone know a workaround for this?     Side note: has anyone else noticed assistant cant control spotify any more?! I used to be able to skip tracks, fast forward etc...doesnt work any more."
"Who is in charge of the Google Assistant / Philips Hue integration?     Before I could say ""sleep my lights"" and they would fade out from that color.  NOW, they brighten up and turn yellow, and THEN fade out from there.  It made much more sense the way it was working before.     Let ME choose the color to fade out from!     Does anyone from Google read this subreddit?"
Why can't Google include sunrise and sunset to a routine. I hate having to change my light routines every couple of mo that to account for the change.  I can't even use the GE app because my lights only show up in the Google home app.
"My wife and I are expecting a baby in December, and I was thinking about getting our parents a digital frame that can sync an album from google photos that I would share out to their accounts of the baby.    My question is, can the nest hub display photos from an album shared to the user signed in?  if so, does it automatically update off the album or is there some kind of sync that it may need to have happen to update?  Neither of our parents currently have a digital assistant, and I don't know how much they would use the assistant features, but the nest hub is cheaper than a nixplay frame (the only frame I have found in my limited searing that supports google photos) and has more functionality if they end up using it"
"Over the past couple months or so, Google Assistant has been erroneously transcribing parts of my utterances as ""aero"" for no apparent reason. The words I'm actually saying instead are quite varied, and typically sound absolutely nothing like ""aero"" other than perhaps syllable count. And if I do actually try saying ""aero"" to see what gets transcribed, it comes up as ""arrow"" 100% of the time (I do not pronounce these two words exactly the same... I can splat it way out, equivalent to /air-o/, and it always comes up as ""arrow"" -- this is fine, whatever, I never use the word ""aero"" except during this test).  Does anyone else have this problem?  Here's an example: earlier today I wanted ""No Woman No Cry lyrics"". I had to ask 3 times before it correctly transcribed.

"Hey all.  Just wondering if anyone knows of a way to do this?  Obviously my reminders pop up on my phone and tablet.

I use a lot of reminders and would be cool if I could set this up. Thanks heaps"
"Lately, when I ask my Echo a question directed to ""Alexa"" Google Assistant on my Android phone jumps in and starts trying to answer the question or starts looking things up. I understand how this is happening because I am NOT saying ""Hey Google"" or ""OK Google"" so I am baffled.  It's gotten so ridiculous that when I say ""Alexa, Go Home"" which is the special command to turn on my TV set and show the FireTV ""Home"" page, Google Maps/Destination starts up on my phone, churns a few seconds and then says: ""You are already home"" like some kind of a smart aleck remark!     Would appreciate any explanation as to how/why this is happening and what I can do to stop it. I thought Google Assistant could only be summoned by ""Hey Google"" or ""OK Google"" or hands-on touching its special place on the screen and I am not touching my phone - It's beyond my reach."

"Trying to trigger a Tasker action from Assistant but when I try ""open Tasker Secondary"" it just opens Tasker. It seems that anything after the space is discarded or possibly sent as a command line argument. I tried ""open Tasker test"" which doesn't exist and it also opens Tasker. It's there some way for me to work around this issue? Putting the app name in quotes just treats it as a search."
"My action has been up for 5 months with no problems, suddenly today I got an email saying this:     This is a notice that your action has been taken down due to the following violations:  1.

"I have created a simple routine to unmute my phone, adjust the volume, show the weather, display calendar and commute time and then, after slowly going through the previous actions, play some audio broadcasts.

"Why does Google Assistant play the 'live' version or 'remix' version of a requested song on Spotify instead of playing the 'standard' version, happens so often. That's just so dumb, if I wanted a certain version of ask for it. For example, I asked GA to play Enter Sandman by Metallica, it then plays a live version instead of the standard version which I have been playing a lot of late from my Playlists."
Hi everyone! I was waiting for the Lenovo tablet with the google assistant ambient mode but I had to get ready for my trip and ended up just picking up the Samsung tab S6.

"Hi all,  Until recently, all of my wifi sockets could be activated by voice command via assistant with no need to unlock the screen - after what I can only assume is a recent update, I now have to unlock the screen on my S10 to do this.

(On top of that, spotify voice commands like fast forward etc no longer work...any ideas?)  Thanks!"

"I have just discovered custom commands using google assistant. I love this feature and have set it up with a few of my own commands. One of my favorite ones plays ""now I'm here"" by queen when I say ""hey google where are you."" I use this feature whenever I misplace my phone in my house.   It's a wonderful feature but I ran into a snag when I tried to set up a different command. I wanted the command to allow me to say something along the lines of ""play me something new"" and it play new songs from spotify that I havent heard before. I figured it might be possible if I could get the assistant to correctly follow this sequence of:  Open spotify library &gt; shuffle play 'favorite songs' album &gt; open options menu &gt; select 'go to radio'.  The issue is that I dont know how to write that in a way that the assistant will be able to understand. I have seen similar things be coded on to NFC chips, specifically [this NFC ring](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=AEe-b6jrung&amp;t=10m57s) that launches youtube, opens a channel page, and subscribes the user, so I'm hoping this can be achieved with routines. But I also fear the limitations of the commands will make it difficult.   Does anyone know how to program routines to make this happen?"

"I use a Pixel Slate + Folio for work, and would like to push the button to summon the assistant and ask it to bring up a document from Google Drive/Docs. Does anyone know the syntax for this? I have tried ""Open *Filename* in *Folder* in *Google Drive/Docs""* and a ton of variations but it doesn't work. I once got it to work a while back by having the document in the top level of Gdrive I think but can't remember.  Also, does the assistant function differently when summoned by push/squeeze/click vs when summoned by voice? I feel like I get different results no matter the device. I usually like voice detection off though because I work in the home a lot and already have ambient voice detection. It's annoying to have my phone, watch, and chromebook all pop up saying that they are listening, interrupting all 3 devices, when I am talking to my Mini."

"Hello,  Recently i have tried to dig into the ""Actions"" that are available for the Google Assistant and save them for later to try it out.

When i click on ""Favorites"" on desktop, it doesn't show anything but if i search the name of one action i saved, it shows that it is on my favorites.  Is Google even aware of this ? I'm becoming more and more tired and sick of all the bugs arround Google Assistant and Google Home, it's just plain catastrophic."
"I am presently trying Android over iOS. I have a Nokia 8.1 which have upgraded to Android 10. I am facing an issue where Google assistant refuses to place a call intermittently, all it says when I ask to make a call is, sorry I can't make calls yet, where as at times it makes the call seamlessly. I have tried reinstalling Google, clear cache and memory, I also try to reboot as well as reset the phone to factory settings, but there has not been any fundamental difference in the intermittent call issue with Google assistant.   I  am also noticing that from home screen now Google assistant has stopped taking the voice command for activation I have to make a hard physical swipe to get Google assistant activated.   Any response or resolution methods that you yourself have put into use with the same issues will be highly appreciated my switch over to Google from iOS depends on how assistant performs and well aslo l decide also whether it's going to be an iPhone 11 Pro or Google pixel 4.   I am reaching out to reddit because there are no credible information online on this issue and there is no helpline for a responsive forum for Android. Over to you reddit 🤗"

"When I'm listening to PodcastAddict while I'm driving the ads drive me crazy since I don't have a way to fast forward without fiddling with my phone.   I just discovered I can use Google Asisstant to fast forward in 2 steps, ""ok google Fast Forward 60 seconds"" and then ""ok google play podcast addict"".   I went to set a routine to do both these commands whenever I say ""skip ad"".  I have the commands set as ""fast forward 60 seconds"" and ""play podcast addict"" but my routine refuses to  automatically play after skipping ahead.   Why doesn't my routine work but the commands can be used individually? How can I fix this?   Follow up questions: Any advice on why Google Assistant can open some podcasts on PodcastAddict like the Dollop but not others like Science Vs?"
"I'm looking for recommendations from the community on useful Routines for those that don't have much in the way of smart home equipment.  Through various giveaways, I know have three Home Minis in my house, along with a Pixel and a Chromebook. I'd love to start taking advantage of the power of Routines but much of the research I've done has led me to Routines to control smart lights, smart security cameras, or Nest devices. I don't have any of those so I'm looking for recommendations of how others with a similar tech set-up have used Routines."
"I have a couple of Google Home devices around my house so whenever I use the phrase near my phone, both the phone and the Home will do the command. I don't really use the assistant when I'm out and about, and that just leaves the car, where I do use the assistant for making calls and such. Is there a way to enable the assistant on my phone when it's connected to my car's Bluetooth? Is there an alternative suggestion you guys have? Thanks in advance"

"I don't want to hear News from Google Assistant. Ever.  So I'm looking for a way to disable it entirely. I have found the setting for news sources in the Google app and removed all sources, but GA still plays News at seemingly kind of random times. I might have been listening to music and paused it a few minutes ago, and then I press play/pause on my headphones to resume, but instead of playing the music it plays the F-ing news!?"
" So my brother is disabled and I got him a galaxy A20 so that he could use google assistant on it to be more independent. However in the voice match settings on the A20 is says ""say 'ok google' when your screen is on"" which is different to my galaxy s9 which says ""say 'ok google' even if your screen is off or you're using your favorite apps"". Is there some other setting that will change this? or is it just a difference between the models? I have spent all day trying to fix it and came to the conclusion that it is because of the difference in models which is an extremely arbitrary decision to make, and severely limits accessibility for disabled people."

"A moment ago my google home broadcast that it's dinner time.  It freaked me out because it's 11pm here, we ate dinner long ago, and my wife is fast asleep in the bedroom.  (I initially thought she was messing with me... nope, she's out like a light)  So I checked ""My Activity"" and for the last 40 minutes or so my ""My Activity"" has been recording activity that neither myself nor my wife asked.  And it's just the two of us here.   ""My Activity"" recorded a lot of unclear messages, as well as random ones like asking ""who let the dogs out"" (So that it gives that dumb response), ""add cake to my shopping list"", and asking it to broadcast that it's dinner time.  I troubleshooted the possibility someone snuck their way onto my wifi and was sending commands via their phone or something similar....  but of course they'd need to also be on my Google account to do that.  I live in a country where Google Home penetration is quite low, so I ruled out pranks.  (Unhelpfully, ""My Activity"" doesn't record which specific device is actioning the requests.  It just says ""Google Home"".)  I was about to write a terrified message on this board guessing my account activity had been criss-crossed with someone else's before discovering the real cause.  My computer in the office, which happens to be next to a google home, had restarted itself for an update, re-launched chrome, and started playing youtube on autoplay.  It must've cycled through videos for hours before the ""recommended videos"" algorithm eventually chose a livestream of a Google Home demo.  Every command the youtuber tested out was actioned by my house.    This was the closest I've ever come to feeling like there was a ghost in the house.  I got a bit worked up, I admit, even though I love these things and am by no means a luddite.  Anyways, thanks for reading this far. Glad to see the house isn't haunted by ghosts that like the Baha Men."
"Goal:  I have a Google Assistant Action in Dialogflow, and want to use the actions\_intent\_SIGN\_IN intent. Would like to use G Signin for Account Linking (via voice), and upon permissions approval, add the users email address to a database for subscription to an email newsletter.   I'm assuming Webhook fulfillment will be needed, and am trying to determine the best way to build that.   I've read the Google Signin documentation  [https://developers.google.com/actions/identity/google-sign-in](https://developers.google.com/actions/identity/google-sign-in)  I was informed by Google Support that for this project, a Cloud Function would have latency issues, and that I should use App Engine for the function. Does that sound right?  I've also noticed that the Signin documentation doesn't have examples for Python (the language I'm most familiar with), nor does it have Python support for the validation process as it does for node.js and Java. So am assuming I should build in node.js.   I've also read about Firebase solutions using dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment, but haven't found examples for Google Signin. They also seem to only be in node.js.  [https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#set-up-nodejs-and-the-firebase-cli](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#set-up-nodejs-and-the-firebase-cli)  Any input on how to approach this to achieve my goals would be greatly appreciated."
"I've had a google Mini in my bedroom and a Google Home in the living room for almost two years and things worked fine. I mainly use it to control my TV (via chrome cast), get weather, play music. I have a few routines (I'm heading out, I'm going to bed, etc..) that would turn on/off lights and play forest sounds, etc..    A friend of mine gave me his Google Home Hub (smaller screen) and I added it, and took my Google home mini to work.  I have the Hub in my kitchen and moved the Google home to my bedroom.  SInce then, commands that work in the bedroom (on the google home) do not work on the hub. Simple things like ""play the beatles abbey road on spotify"" has the Hub crap out ""I'm sorry, please repeat the command and include which device you wish to play this on.""  The command works on the home.  ""Set the volume to 30% on all speakers"" gets the same message. I have to specify the individual speaker/hub or say ""home group"" - command works fine on the Home.  I have the home group set as the default so I don't understand why suddenly I have to specify the home group every time when using the Hub. It's maddening because it's not consistent.  Also, if I say ""play the beatles"" on the Home it plays it on both speakers, and if I then walk over to the Hub and say ""play the beach boys"" it only plays it on the Hub and the Home is still playing the other song. It doesn't do this the other way around. Does the Hub treat groups differently?  Also, when at work and I say the same music command, it plays music at HOME even though the mini is no longer part of the home group and is now in a new group called work.   Why isn't this easier? lol"

"The title says it all - the query used to find out whether it's advised to take an umbrella when I'm heading out no longer works for me. I always asked the query in the title, or I went for a future prediction by asking ""Will I need an umbrella at 2 PM/in 4 hours/in the evening/etc"".  It used to work for ages, but a few days/weeks ago it stopped working on my phone (2 XL), on my Home Mini, on the Assistant on my watch (LG Urbane 2) and in my Pixel Buds.  Has the feature/query been removed? Did someone else use it and now it's not working for you as well? Or is it working fine for you? The same used to work when asking about sunglasses, and now I'm just getting random search results or the Assistant asks ""Did you ask about the current weather conditions?"". It used to reply something like ""Yes, rain is expected today in [your city]"".  I Googled this and found just one person with the same issue: https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/15117753?hl=en"
"Hey everyone,  As someone whose language is not yet supported by Google Assistant (Portuguese from Portugal*) I heard that new languages are being tested in beta, including Portuguese. Has anyone heard rumors that Google will announce new languages on the October 15th event, or everything’s silent on that front? That would be great!  Thanks!  PS: if anyone is using the portuguese google assistant beta, how is it performing so far?!   *Just a note: Brazilian Portuguese is supported, but the accent and some terminology is different enough to be uncomfortable to use"
"I have this issue and it's really irritating as I used to use the feature on a daily basis before it broke.  Before I could just say:""Hey Google, play [song name ]on Deezer"" and the song would start playing in the next few seconds.   I don't know when, and why, and how, but that functionality is now missing.  It says that ""something's gone wrong"" most of the times, but sometimes it just opens the Deezer app and does nothing.  Sometimes it opens the Deezer app and after a few seconds a pop-up window appears saying ""Failed to play, requested content is not able to load"".  Can this somehow be fixed and how? It was a really useful feature."
"I have lived with the assistant for around 4 months now, and I have to say that it's fairly pointless overall as an experience. It will often misunderstand queries or is unresponsive. Most of the things it can apparently do for me I can do more quickly by just accessing the phone in a conventional manner.  I really wanted to use it, but I would often forget it even existed. It would need to be several times more sophisticated for me to really but into it. It's a pretty dumb assistant ultimately. Not to mention the creepy data mining..."
"So I just recently rant Ethernet cable from my house to my workshop (about 75 ft away). I have my regular Linksys router in the house and have an Ethernet cable running off that into a Google WiFi in the garage and now the workshop. I have Google home minis throughout the house including the garage and workshop. I wanted to create a speaker group but the Google home program won't let me because they are connected to ""different Wi-Fi's"". Is this a normal thing for the home minis that they cannot be controlled unless you are connected to that specific network? Is there a work around?"

"Hi!  &amp;#x200B;  Here's my issue:  1. I am happily listening to Pocketcasts (or any other podcasts app) 2. I trigger GA to ask something (via bluetooth) 3. When GA stops talking, the previous playback does not come back.

When I say, “OK Google, listen to the news”, it just opens YouTube and starts playing random clips.

"I can start an alarm with a voice command such as: ""Hey Google, Set a timer for 10 seconds."" However, once the alarm rings, I can't figure out how to stop it with a voice command. If I try: ""Hey Google, stop alarm,"" the Google assistant replies: ""You can do this in the app,"" and the alarm doesn't stop until I turn it off manually. Is there a way to stop an alarm with a voice command, perhaps by using a special alarm app rather than the built in Clock app? I have Samsung Galaxy S8, One UI version 1.0, Android version 9."
"I've recently lost the ability to have assistant send text messages for me. If I attempt to send one, it pulls up the contact I asked for, but the text of the message gets placed in the search box.

Is anyone else experiencing this problem? Thanks!"
Without  any warning that I've seen Google Assistant now listens to for a whole host of additional wake phrases to run some generic routines. I found out when my phone was triggered by a video it was playing.  I can find setting to add more phrases but no option to disable routines or remove any of the trigger phrases that are causing issues.   Can anyone point me to where to turn this off? Otherwise I will need to disable voice entirely.
I want to set up a command where my chrome cast plays the last thing I was watching on Netflix. I can't find the right command because it doesn't seem to be specific enough.  This is with the intention of using it in a routine  Any suggestions?
"I'm really frustrated by assistant these days especially when using it via Android Auto. I have it read me a text message and it asks if I'd like to respond. I say yes. It asks me what I'd like to respond. I speak my response and then it says ""I don't know how to help with that."" I've done everything I can think of to try an get this to work. I've cleaned up all of my contact phone numbers. I've cleared the Google app data. I've disabled and re-enabled the app. I've checked permissions. I just don't get it. Has anyone else been experiencing this and found a fix?"
"Since yesterday evening Google Assistant has been crashing on my Pixel 3 XL. I tried:   1. Clearing all data for the Google app 2. Removing myself from the Google app beta (waiting for it to actually ""update"" to the non-beta version) 3. Clearing data for the Google Play Services app 4. Logging out/in to my Google Account 5. Installing the latest security patches for Android 10 6. Contacting Pixel support for assistance (The support rep and experience was great, but they weren't able to solve my issue. Thankfully, they never asked me to do a factory reset.)  I figured I'd test the Assistant on my old Galaxy S8, and found that it had the same issue. After speaking with several co-workers I found that some of them were having the exact same issue, but not all (one person even has the same model of phone that I do, and is also on Android 10.) We found that if you uninstall all updates for the Google app, it will function. However, once you install the latest updates it crashes again.  TLDR; if Google Assistant is crashing for you, uninstall all updates for the ""Google"" app and disable auto-update for it, at least until a patch is released."
"Ok, there are alot of funny things my assistant can do and i would like to use it even if they need to know my trousers size etc. But most of the time im quitting while insulting my assistant in a very bad way.  newest case: ""pls write a sms to \*\*\*\*\*"" ""you want to send it to mobile or landline?""

"Hello everyone. I'm new to using the Google Assistant features in general, and was wondering if there is a way to set it so my assistant reads the time and weather when an alarm goes off in the morning.

"So just a little background. While offline, I used to be able to say ""OK Google, play Aerosmith"" for example and it used to play Aerosmith from my downloaded songs on Google Play Music.  Now the only command it will understand is ""OK Google, play music"". If I name a band in particular it says that it can't help me because I'm offline. If I don't name the band it will start playing anything from my downloads.  Does anyone know how I can get it to recognize particular music bands? I'm not sure what's changed but it's frustrating as hell.  Any help would be appreciated!"

I'm hoping to create a daily routine that will automatically push navigation directions to work with a couple of stops to drop off kids.

"Now, I also posted this on the r/Hue community, but I found out that also my blinds have the same problem as described below;  For some odd reason Google Assistant now shows every single scene from Philips Hue as a 'device'.   It is hard to explain, but Google Assistant should only show the device 'kitchen table' and not all the scenes that are possible on that particular light. So at this point I am having over 50 'devices' being shown under Philips Hue in my Google Assistant. Instead of just showing the 7 actual lightbulbs, it shows those 7 lights AND all the available scenes, and that for every single light. It's one big mess and annoys me and I just can't figure out a solution.  I have completely resetted my Philips Hue bridge and connected back all the lights one by one to the Bridge and then link my Bridge back to the Assistant, but it makes no difference.  ---   So with my blinds I have the same exact problem. It doesn't only show those 2 blinds, but also all different 'scenes/settings' which are available for that particular blind.  It seems the problem is caused by Google Assistant, as not only Hue is a problem, but also my blinds which are from Somfy.  Thanks in advance!"

"I've been struggling with frequent issues with the Play Store updates and installs stalling at 99%. Sometimes an install takes a couple hours.  I had read many different posts about this problem. All of them said to delete cache, and the usual stuff. Sometimes it temporarily helps, often not.  Yesterday I ran across a post stating that he finds that the apps install and update fine if he disables Google (ie. the Assistant). I have tried that, and to my surprise, have had that tactic work for me every time I've tried it (only 4 times so far). But given my lack of success with all other suggestions along with my apparent success when I disable Google, I am inclined to think this is the issue.   I wonder if Google has any idea of this and if there is any fix in the future."

"I recently purchased a Pixel 3 XL and have had some odd experiences when I have been using the Google Assistant to send messages to contacts.  For example, this morning, I attempted to send a message to my husband.  I said ""Ok Google"" and it chimed in response.  I said ""Send a hangouts message to my husband"" and it responded ""Hang ssg to and &lt;chime&gt;""  -- that's my best phonetic description of the message being clipped, half the words were omitted or clipped and the prompt was jumbled.  Given the context, I went ahead and dictated my message, which it also clipped up as above, then when asking ""Send it or change it?"" it was more like ""Sen or Ch t?""

Any ideas? Would be nice to have GA just speak over the music. GA's behavior happens even when just asking to turn a light on. Ugh. \[pixel 3; ver 9 and now ver 10 this happens on\] Thanks

"*tl;dr. How do I record an audio note, offline &amp; hands free, while driving*  Online, Google Assistant saves a record of both my voice and the transcription to Google Keep. Offline, Google Assistant only saves the transcription. (A bit obnoxious, considering that the audio-as-back-up is less necessary for memos recorded online than offline.)  Asking GA to place a call to a Google Voice number and then leaving a message appears to be one workaround. I'm on a Google Fi plan. So, I'll need to set up a throwaway email and use a friend's phone to get that going.  I tried asking GA to open Easy Voice Recorder, which is operational offline. Unfortunately, GA doesn't recognize the Easy Voice Recorder app. Although, looks like it's a moot point. GA can open Google Keep online but didn't open it offline. So, I suppose ""open app x"" doesn't work offline anyhow.  Any ideas?"
"My Google Assistant doesn't respond to ""Ok Google"" or ""Hey Google"" when the screen is off but responds when the screen is on.  How to make Google Assistant respond when the screen is off?"

"""Hey Google, Spin up a Minecraft server!""   Doesn't that sound cool? That's exactly what I'm currently creating!   I have the mission to create a VERY SIMPLE Minecraft host. It's that simple: Just ask your Google Assistant to create a Minecraft-Server - and there you go! Two minutes later you can play with your friends. For free! Because with payments this won't be simple.   Currently I'm looking for up to 20 alpha testers who would like to help me realize this project.   The only requirements:  Live in the US, Canada or Europe  Have access to any Google Assistant device  I need to be able to reach you by email   Ready? Fill out this form and I will contact you in the next days:  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMrnZsEZMjQaOPR8Q6v9x5Y2tD5acOaHa5CNkGS_St4N4BSA/viewform"
"Hi, whether I say or type the command my assistant won't play my friend's playlist on Spotify (that I follow) instead it plays an album or a song with the same name. It plays my own playlists. Is this feature not available?"
"Well for Spanish talkers, I'm going to write this in Spanish  for be more clear.

"Hello all,  EMUI 9.1.0, Mate 20 pro, Bose QC35ii 4.5.2 firmware for the Bose  Whenever I get a message on fb I simply press the assistant button on the headphones once to make the assistant read the message for me. This however sometimes(!) resets the headphone. It disconnects and automatically reconnects to the phone.  Another glitch which ai discovered lately but the occurrence rate for this is 100%: I started using the routines. I haven't modified the morning routine yet so it automatically plays the latest news. Now when I use my headphones and I'm listening to e.g. Spotify, pausing the music for any reason with the button on the headphones and then I press the assistant button to check the time and/or my notifs. When it doesn't disconnect it will play them but after this I press the play/pause button it will start playing the news again. What's interesting is that it plays ONLY the last few seconds of the last news.   Both of them are extremely frustrating. Anyone encountered this problem before? Probably the first issue could be originated from Bose, however when I had an iPhone I was forced to use Alexa and although I didn't use it that often, none of these happened to me."

I use the assistant to wake me up for work via Chromecast speakers and I'd like to disable it instead of deleting the entire routine when I have free day.
"I have to send messages in German and English in about equal quantities, so the following plays out approximately every four months:  - I add German as a second language in assistant (phone is US English).  - I am amazed at how the assistant instantly picks up on which language I am using. I alternate German and English commands just for fun, every single one works perfectly.  - Over the next few weeks, Assistant begins interpreting more and more words as German, even if I speak English.  - After about a month, I reach the point where every single thing I say, no matter whether garbled or stage actor-ly enunciated, is interpreted as a random collection of German words that are then searched for on Google.  - As this renders my Assistant utterly useless, I turn off German support and everything instantly goes back to normal.  - The next time I enable German, it works again.  What is this strange behavior? Is anyone else experiencing something similar?  My best guess is that Assistant has some machine learning going on and trains on my voice, but I use English commands much more frequently than German, so should it not bias towards English? And is there some way to disable it? For the first few days after activation, before this hypothetical learning process, it recognizes every word flawlessly."
"When I'm driving and I ask google to send a text message, it hasn't been adding punctuation and upper case letters. It's really inconsistent and I haven't been able to figure out why.  Anyone have a similar thing happening? Or a solution?"
"Works fine through the phone when unlocked. Works fine with Bluetooth headset when unlocked as well.  When I try to activate assistant when device is locked through headset by double tapping the left ear piece she just rants about ""when it's safe. Tap the notification to use Google assistant with your headset"" or something like that.  I tap the notification and open the device and it takes my to the assistant. This is very inconvenient when your phone is in your backpack and you want to adjust the volume..  I have the ""accept commands through Bluetooth headset when device is locked"" enabled.  I had it working yesterday until I deactivated the option and found that ""Bluetooth audio recording"" messed with the assistant so the volume command didn't work.  And now, no matter what I do she won't activate on the lockscreen.."
"I have Spotify premium account, when I cast using the app all works well, but when I tell me phone Google assistant to play something on my living room TV Spotify will play an ad every now and then.  My account re linked both in home app and in Google assistant."
"If I am driving and I get a text message I would like to use voice commands to hear the message and send a reply, but this does not work very well.   I can tell Google, ""read my last message,"" and it does so. But this completely stops any audio that is playing. It won't resume after the message is read (as when playback pauses due to a navigation cue) and I actually have to go dig into the app and press Play again there. (The suggested voice command for ""Continue playing music"" doesn't work at all.)   If I want to reply to a message, I can tell Google, ""reply to my last message."" Google listens, but it doesn't do what I want. Instead of taking right to message composition it first asks me to name the recipient. So I have to name a name, and then select the right phone number. That's irritating since the information is already implicit in stating I want to *reply* to a message. It's two extra steps in a loud car which adds a lot of wasted time and chances for error.   https://i.imgur.com/lxqJFEE.png  This is a disappointing experience so I generally don't use voice to interact with text messages unless it is super important.   Anyone have hints on how to make this work better?   FYI I do use Hangouts as my SMS client as I am a Fi user, but it doesn't seem to make a difference if I refer to my ""last message"" or ""last hangouts message."""
"I have an LG V40 which has Google Assistant built in, and I set up the Voice Match feature so that I can activate Google Assistant by saying the phrases OK Google/Hey Google. However, if I don't use my phone for several hours, it won't activate Google Assistant via the voice phrases unless I restart my phone. Does anyone else have this problem and/or do you know any solution for it? Thanks in advance"
It's retarded that you have to go into the google app to view your reminders if you don't want to ask the assistant for it. Wouldn't it make more sense to make a shortcut such as the shopping list shortcut found in Google Express?

Anyone able to send text messages using Norwegian assistant. I get all the way to the part where assistant asks if I want to send the message.
"Anyone else noticed that the assistant has now stopped using the word ""the"" when referring to devices it is controlling? For example I have a device called ""fountain"" on a smart plug. I would say ""turn on the fountain"" and it would reply ""Ok, turning on **the** fountain"". Now it simply says ""Ok, turning on fountain"" as if it was a proper noun and not just a generic noun. Anyone else?  Tempted to rename all my devices with the word ""the"" in front of them...."
"I never used to have this issue but in the past week or so it's been happening.   If I try to set a reminder on my phone by typing it in (if I'm at work and don't want to look crazy talking to my phone) I used to be able to open up google assistant and type in ""remind me to take out the trash tonight at 7"" and it would do it.  Lately though it will say ""Sorry, I won't be able to create a reminder for Me until you've added their Google account to your contacts.""   I haven't changed anything.

Does it work properly for anyone? It used to be the best feature of Google Now (when copying text was also an option) and now it barely works. Sometimes I might get some relevant results on what the screen is showing but most of the times I get nothing (even if there are for example several movies titles on the screen). I remember that waiting few seconds before selecting the what's on my screen option was helping but nowadays this doesn't help either.  Is Google aware of it? Any issue tracker active where I can vote/provide feedback?

It took full note of what I said about the title and the date but when the actual day comes, no notifications or floating notifications pop up.

That would be a wonderful experience."
"I bought a new JBL Link Bar — a soundbar with Android TV and Google Assistant built-in — and I’ve gotta say it has been a very frustrating experience.   Anytime the device restarts (e.g. after a system update), it no longer responds to voice commands. The only way I’ve discovered that fixes this is to factory reset the device.   When I open Google Home after a restart, I notice that there are multiple linked devices for the same Link Bar — only all but one are “ghost” devices from the previous times I’ve had to factory reset.   Apparently each time I’ve factory reset the device, the old profile persists as a “ghost” devices. I can unlink these ghost devices, but they always reappear after a restart.   **Things I’ve tried**  * Factory reset: only works into the next restart, then the voice activation breaks * Signing out of the Link Bar and signing back in * Deleting my “Home” in the Google Home app, unlinking the Link Bar and the ghost devices, then creating a new home (with a different name) * Doing all of the above in various orders   Nothing works. I’m at my wit’s end.   Any suggestions?"

"Hi all,  Some backstory first: My car has separate Bluetooth devices for calls and music streaming - my car radio has phone Bluetooth but not a2dp, so I have a little Bluetooth device which plugs into my auxiliary jack on my car stereo.  For whatever reason, my a2dp device refuses to auto connect, but always connects when I go into Bluetooth settings.  So, it works but it is clunky.  To improve this, I was hoping to issue a command to the Google Assistant to initiate the connection (which creates the possibility that I could add it to a routine). However, I have not found a command to initiate a Bluetooth connection.    Does such a command exist?  Every combination of queries I have tried have just resulted in the assistant returning some search results on Google.  Thanks in advance for your help."

"I saw a post on the net somewhere about how the assistant on our phones is now able to read incoming WhatsApp and other messages. I own a headset with assistant, that could already do this but whenever I ask my phone, it won't work.   To make things even more mysterious: assistant does reply with instructions how to get her to read my messages. So I ask: read me my messages, and her reply is: if you want me to read your messages, just say: ”read me my messages"".   Phone is a S10+, latest updates. Language is Dutch. Anyone else who has this? Known fixes?"

""i couldn't find a list called ""grocery"", do you want me to make one?"" Never done that before.

My Sony 4K 2017 has Google Assistant built-in. I'm thinking of going all minimalist and giving away my OG Google Home and using the TV as my primary speaker. Is this okay or am I going just a bit too far?
"My assistant doesn't let me turn on the voice recognition to let it turn just by saying ""Ok Google"" unless the system language is english. I have my phone in Chinese for study and work reasons, otherwise will be in Italian and in neither of these two languages it lets me turn on the option. I tried turning it on switching to English, but when I change the language back it turns off. Also, since it's not active it doesn't let me activate the assistant with the wireless earphones gesture. How can I solve this?"
"Hey !  So, I just realized that anyone was able to turn on my phone screen, say Ok Google, and use the assistant to, let's say, set up an alarm at 1AM or something, without needing to unlock the phone (it still asks for a PIN when trying to send a message or call someone).  The setting that is supposed to allow that (with Voice match) is disabled, I just have the normal ""Access from any screen"" setting on. Does anyone have/know how to solve the issue?  By the way, Voice match doesn't seem to work at all, anyone can trigger the assistant on my phone, which is pretty weird considering how well it used to work."

"I found the slider to disable Google Assistant, which does technically prevent Assistant itself from opening. Unfortunately, I now get a prompt to ""turn on"" Google Assistant every three minutes whenever I do anything on the phone involving audio.  Voice calls and listening to music are nearly impossible.

"I've noticed on some devices telling Google to add an item to the shopping list, doesn't just add it to the default shopping list, but instead asks me which list to add it to. Unfortunately, I don't always say the EXACT name correctly, so it then asks if I want to create that list..... it's pretty annoying. Example: my default shopping list is Groceries, but if I tell it to add it to the grocery list, it wants to create a new list called Grocery List.....     I really just want it to add it to the default list in the first place. It seems I have bigger issues with non-Google products doing this like the Lenovo Smart Displays.

Can I disable the pretty please functionality on my home minis?  I am not interested in Google telling me how happy it is I said please.  I just want it to do what I asked.
Just asked my Lenovo Clock to turn on a light and was greeted with a pleasant dinging tone instead of a novel about how she was going to turn on the light. Verified on a Home Mini as well. Hallelujah!!!  Anyone else seeing this yet? The Lenovo Clock is not on the Preview Program either.

I've been searching through settings for what feels like 2 hours and I can't find anything."
I love the feature of asking assistant on my phone to recognize a song for me but mostly I want to use it when watching shows via Chromecast and Google Assistant always tries to identify the show / episode name as song title instead of listening. 😭
"Ok so i know that theres a way to see all of your ""todo list"" in google assistant which called coming up for you.  And there's also that ""Daily"" idea such as the daily weather brief and etc.   But, is there a way to combine both of them ? can i get my ""coming up for you"" as a daily ?  I'd really like to get briefed automatically every evening about what i have tomorrow..   Thanks ;)"
I have a morning routine that has been playing the same radio station every morning for the last 3 months. The last 2 days it's been playing a song from Spotify instead. I haven't changed anything and the routine still says it's set to at the radio.  I've tried removing and re-adding the option etc. and it will still only play Spotify.   If I tell it to play the station manually it does so I'm not sure what's happening.  Any ideas?
"This thing used to work ok but seriously, I've even tried setting up routines as it's something built in I still can't get this hot piece of garbage to work every time. I have quite a few smart devices at home and I want to use them as intended, instead lately if my phone is sitting on my desk and I tell it to ""turn on the lamps"" for example it will either work, or it will repeatedly tell me to go an fist myself and unlock my phone. I can try a couple more times and it either works or the app hangs altogether, this is on an S9+ btw. Pardon my rant but I'd rather do this than smash a pricey phone that did nothing.   Any insight is very appreciated. Yes I know, 1st world problems :)"
"I used to say ""time"" very often and it would, unsurprisingly, give me the time. Today however I've noticed that it's unable to answer it.   On a Google Home it's saying it can't help with that yet and on my phone it just gives me search results. If I ask ""what's the time"", it does tell me the time. It definitely understands me as I can see it on my phone, it just doesn't know how to respond."

"I know saying ""OK Google, turn off the master bedroom TV"" will turn off my master bedroom TV.

"I've got a Moto x4 on the latest Pie update.  I do have Google Assistant, and have for a while, which I can  see by holding down the Home button and get the Google Assistant popup from the bottom of the screen.  However, if I press the microphone button in the Google search bar widget, I get a Google Voice Search popup from the top of the screen.   They both have separate voices, and using Voice Search is \*a lot\* less reliable (like, when it asks me yes/no questions and I say ""yes"", it searches for the band Yes).  Saying ""OK Google"" seems to be a toss up as to which will answer (Assistant or Voice Search), which then affects how successful my next command is.  I thought Voice Search was supposed to be totally killed of, though, as of the end of last year, but it appears to still be on my phone, and I want it gone so it's only the more reliable Assistant that answers me."
"Previously I was able to use the Google assistant on Bose soundbar 700 to play my Spotify music by saying ""play ____ from Spotify on soundbar"".  However lately I seems to be unable to command it from my soundbar. It will always respond ""I can't do this on this device yet, you may ask me to play it on other devices"". However when I use my Google assistant from my phone it is able to get the soundbar to play music from soundbar. Has anyone encountered such problem?"

Ok google is not working.  in the settings menu of the assistant in the google home app, there is no option to be found to enable ok google.  voice match is disabled on both devices as well, and is greyed out so cannot be enabled. It shows the error that its not available on the current language. I have tried it with dutch and english mixed as language, but also disabling either. They both wont work and voice match remains greyed out."
"I am just a beginner and this is my first action. I made it as a summer project in my school but am having a really tough time in publicizing it. Any and all ideas would be appreciated.

So I have a Google Home Mini and when I ask it 'How Long Will It Take To Get To School' it's set to my old school.  I know it was in my Google+ account (when it existed) and I can't find the option now.  Anyone know how to change this?

"So I love using my Google Home to turn off the TV (Sony KD55AF8) and change the volume etc. but around 2 months into owning the tv it seems that the ability to turn *on* the Tv with the google home/assistant has stopped working.  It seems to work if the Tv has recently just been turned off (as if theres a 15min cool off or something), but if it's been off for a while, you have to use the remote. This means when asking the google home to play music via Spotify, it can't find the device and fails to launch.  Anyone know what's going on here and if there is some 15 minute standby before being fully switched off - is there a way to disable it?"
"Hello world,   I've tried with many response's types to send a clickable phone number but I didn't find the trick to do it.   \- Simple response and table card don't work even copy/paste  \- link out suggestion needs a URL   &amp;#x200B;  Anyone here have a trick ?   Thanks!"
"J am on a Galaxy S8. With some businesses that I have saved under my contacts, Google assistant searches the web for their contact info instead of using what i already have saved in contacts.  Voice recognition is spelling the names exactly as it is spelled in the contact so that is not the issue. It does have permissions to access my contacts. I am running the latest version."
I have a google home mini. I can practically whisper ok google and my Google home hears me and I'm like 7 ft away. Does anyone know how it can hear me so well? Does the mini have a really good microphone or is it a software thing? This might be a dumb question but I'm really impressed by it.
"When ever I ask my Google Assistant on phone or Google home wherever to play my YouTube Music playlist it plays some songs which sound like my playlist name. But it works so well with Spotify though. Is it only for me or known issue?  Eg : Not working Play my playlist ""{playlist name}""  Play my playlist ""{playlist name}"" on YouTube music"

"Google assistant can't seem to understand how to pronounce my last name and butchers it whenever I ask it to call someone in my family.  It's really annoying so I googled how to fix this issue and found out about setting a phonetic pronunciation.  However, this does absolutely nothing for whatever reason.  No matter what I type in the phonetic pronunciation box, Google assistants pronunciation does not change and I cannot figure out why."
Is it possible to put Google assistant in a mode to continue talking?
"I apologize if this has already been posted - I searched and nothing came up.  &amp;#x200B;  I have several wake-up routines set at particular times. Some days they trigger at the appropriate time, and some days they trigger one hour early. I double- and triple-checked my time zone setting, but it is correct. The fact that it isn't consistently wrong or right is the confusing part. I'm over 80 miles away from the next time zone, so I don't think it's a location issue. (It reminds me of my early 2000s Nokia cell phone - I lived close to a different time zone, and the phone would constantly swap back and forth or sound alarms at the wrong time, so we all had to turn off the automatic time zone setting. This is giving me major flashbacks.)  &amp;#x200B;  Any clue to how I can fix this? I'd really like to use these routines to automate parts of my morning."

"So, as we (Czech citizens) all know, Czech Republic was on Google's map of upcoming languages. It was an unbelievable new, because in the past, Google was always ignoring us (we are not that big after all, so it's understandable). So we all got hyped, media were writing about it, everyone was excited only waiting for Google to push an update around the end of 2018. Guess what. Half a year later and still nothing! So the uprising, logical question is: is our language really going to get a support? Or was it an accident that we were blue on the map? Well, sadly, it doesn't look good. Google didn't make any announcement, they didn't even write anything on their blog. The only information is from their I/O, when they showed updated map of countries that are getting support. Again, guess what. The WHOLE Europe is blue, except us. They made fun of us, they let us get a hope and then they smashed it. They kicked us in the butt. But wait - hope dies last. There still is a small chance for us that Google is working on a support for our language. Very, very small. But it is. So if anyone has ANY informations, please write it to the comments. We, mates from Czechia, would really, really appreciate it."

"Hi all, before I delve into learning dialogflow and actions on google, I'd like to know if I can accomplish this on the platform. Currently I have a few things running on Node-RED (on RPi) and Automate (on Android, similar to Tasker). I have something on Automate that executes in response to a webhook POST request. In IFTTT I set up a voice command in Google Assistant, so I can just say hey google, open the thing, and it does the webhook request, to trigger Automate. I also have a similar thing set up on Node-RED, where a webhook request will trigger an action through Node-RED. And in Node-RED I can send a customized audio response to any other Google device.   The drawback with IFTTT is that it is limited in what it can do, and cannot do follow-up commands, and cannot generate a customized verbal response, among other things. I am not sure what IFTTT is doing in the background to have Google Assistant respond to specific phrases as serve as a private app. Is there a way I can do this myself, to have Google Assistant pick up certain phrases, and let me determine how to respond? Would this be equivalent to a basic chat bot? I saw in some notes that Google Assistant apps were not meant to be private, but can be private if kept in perpetual test mode. With a few smart devices like a switch that I give a name, I can ask Google to turn it on/off and it understands this on its own."
"Why is it that I can get google assistant to read my notifications from fb messenger and reply using dictation, yet I am unable to directly tell google assistant to message someone. Is there a way around this?"
"Hey y'all, I've recently switched from an iPhone to a Pixel 3a because of Google Assistant. I like it much better than Siri.   One thing I really liked on the iPhone, though. When the iPhone is locked I can tell Siri to call someone, and she just does it. I've been using this mostly in the car to call someone with the speaker on on the iPhone. I just did the same thing on the Pixel. It works, but I either have to put my pin # in or give it my finger print. I never had to do that on the iPhone. I like to not have to do that and keep both hands on the wheel. Is there a way to turn this off?"

"I’d like to be able to make calls through my google home mini and Sonos Beam with google assistant.   Problem is, when I start a call by saying “ok google, call George” it says “ok, calling George” and then nothing happens for a few seconds and it makes some weird beep and no call gets placed.   Other times, it says it doesn’t have the contact I am trying to call depending on the contact. For example, it at least will say “okay, calling George” when I try to call George, but if I try to call Susie, it says “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. Say just the first name.” Then when I do it says something like “I couldn’t find that contact.”  When I use google assistant with my iPhone everything works fine.   Any help much appreciated!"
"Weird issue.  I'll tell Google Assistant on my phone to send a text, or set a timer, or whatever, then it'll ask me to confirm.  When I say ""yes"", though, instead of performing the action, it searches for the word ""yes"".  For any question Assistant asks me, it searches for the answer instead of continuing as normal.  Any ideas?"
"Hello,  there was once this feature that reminded me to drive to calendar items when I leave a location in the appointment. I didn't even have to switch on a timer based notification for that appointment. Just the location and it worked.  I absolutely don't remember if I shut that off somehow but I miss this feature.  Is this dead or can I revive this somehow.  When I set a date in the calendar, the appointment will show in the assistant after some minutes and it even shows a google maps card with how long I drive, but I don't get the notification.  Thanks."

"I have Google assistants in all rooms of the house. Right now when I say turn on the lights it turns them all on.  What I would like I want to know is, if my son says turn on the lights can I set it up to only turn and off what he needs.   I want him to be able to tell it to turn on a bed room light, bathroom lights a hall way light and a downstairs light. Essentially creating a trail to our bed room if he gets scared at night.  What I don't want is for him to say turn on the lights and it turns on our master bed room lights.  Any ideas?"
I was trying to re-setup my Harmony Hub now that it has direct support.  When accessing routines in the Home app settings I could only see default routines.

"Every morning Google assistant tells me the traffic conditions from home to work. But every morning I drive to 2 different schools for my kids before driving to work.

"## What on Earth?  It's a skill for the Google Assistant to help you to find the solutions to a quadratic equation in use cases where you do not want to use a calculator or a writing instrument. You talk to Quadratic Guru, he helps you out, you express your gratitude and then the Guru exits the conversation, simple enough.  &gt; Quadratic Guru is built upon a intelligent AI platform that allows you to find solutions to quadratic equations. He will ask you for the coefficients so you need not worry.   Earlier this month, I released my first NPM package (aka JavaScript module) that goes by the name `quadratic-solver` and is available on [the registry](https://npmjs.com/package/quadratic-solver/). I recently learnt that I could create an Action (equivalent to an Alexa skill maybe) and publish it to the Assistant inventory to make it available to everyone. As the popular meme phrase goes: ""*Hold my beer...*"", at the end of the day, I built a functional Action, complete with webhook fulfilment strategy. And yes, this Guru implements the aforesaid module in its fulfilment strategy.  The Action is available for two languages currently (English and Hindi). This meant creating intents, strategies and documentation for both locales. Was it fun? Kind of. Anyway, the privacy policies are available at [https://sudipto.ghosh.pro/qguru/privacy/](https://sudipto.ghosh.pro/qguru/privacy/) and [https://sudipto.ghosh.pro/qguru/privacy/hi/](https://sudipto.ghosh.pro/qguru/privacy/hi/) respectively.  ## How to use this thing?  * Summon your Google Assistant on any supported device and speak out one of the following phrases:    * ""Ok Google, talk to Quadratic Guru""    * ""Ok Google, ask Quadratic Guru to solve my equation"" * Quadratic Guru will talk you through how his wizardry works. In a nutshell, you would have to supply some numbers and the back-end will squirt out the solutions and that would be recited to you :)  ## Who am I?  I am an amateur developer and a high school graduate. To be brutally honest, I was frustrated one morning and came across Google's Developer Community Program. The workflow was totally different, as I have mostly dealt with raw code and not drag-and-drop block-based visual programming of the DialogFlow platform. Keeping all the difficulties aside, I waded through everything and finally published my Action."

With Apple HomeKit and Alexa I’m able to group devices together within a room. For example I have three philips hue bulbs in a single overhead light in living room. There are also separate lamps with hue bulbs in the living room so saying “turn on living room lights” or “turn on living room” would turn on all lights in the room. I’d like to group the three bulbs in the overhead light into a group called “overhead light” so that I can turn that light on without turning on the lamps or having to separately turn on each bulb. Is this at all possible?
"I'm looking into different ""voice assistant"" systems.

If I say ""Haircut at 1:30"" then google assistant, for some reason, changes the reminder time to 1:30 and names the reminder 'Haircut'.    Is the only way to do this by bypassing google assistant and manually typing in the reminder?"
"I removed and added my smart light from Google Home due to an issue with the device, and after adding it back, Google Assistant says that^ instead of just “turning on Nathaniel’s light” as it did before.

"Hello! I just seem to get the hang of it with settings for Google assistant, Re-installed my s10+ and set it up, I do this once in awhile.  Today I tried to make a call and make a reminder  (in my native language swedish and in American) But it just made a Google search ,  I can't seem to understand what to do and it doesn't seem to under swedish since it search for English stuff when I try to make the reminder and call  (voice command : remind me to bla bla tomorrow at 10:00, I tell it this in swedish but it makes a English search on Google )  I have my phone set to English American as primary language And secondary swedish  (It's easier with the English language tbh and Google now / Google cards , whatever it's called , gives me better news in English )  Any ideas ? Thanks"
"Heya! This might be a longshot, but i cant find the answer to my question anywhere.  &amp;#x200B;  I use a headset with a google assistant button, and getting it to read my notifications to me while my phone is'nt nearby is really great.  I've recently changed my phone from a Lenovo P2 to a OnePlus 7Pro. On my Lenovo, the google assistant reads the notifications to me in a Norwegian voice, with a Norwegian pronunciation, wich works great when i get Norwegian messages, which most obviously are.  But on my new phone, the OnePlus, she insists reading the notifications in a English voice, with English pronunciation, which makes every message completly incomprehensible to me.  My phone is set up in Norwegian. My google account is set up in Norwegian. Every setting mirrors my old phone, but she insists of speaking English to me.   &amp;#x200B;  Do anyone here know how to change the language of the spoken notifications?"

"Hi,  So I have a severe to profound hearing loss. My speech is not the best, I occasionally have an accent, and sometimes I jumble my words, and I start to stutter. I am more comfortable typing in commands. I don't see a way to type commands to Google Assistant, only speak commands to Google Assistant? Is Google Assistant even disability friendly?"
"Or ""Sorry, I can't reach Wemo"" when I say ""turn on light"" or similar. Attempts to turn on/off Wemo devices in Google Home app failed too. The Wemo devices are all online and fully functional with Echo Dot and Wemo app (both on wifi and cellular network). It happens on all Google Assistant devices including standard Google Home, Google Home Mini and Insignia portable smart speaker. Previously this happens occasionally but they would resume work after short period. Server maintenance I thought. This time it stopped working for 2 weeks already.  So far I have tried, Unlinked and added Wemo in Google Home app Disabled, enabled Google Assistant in Wemo's Remote Access settings. Forget and disable Remote Access and enabled it again. None of these attempts work. Any suggestions?"

Once my phone is unlocked, it will not respond. When i tap the microphone icon, it will listen, and the voice typing on my keyboard works. So I don't think it's an application holding the mic.  &amp;#x200B;  I have gone through the usual:  \-Toggling Voice Match off/on  \- Deleting voice model and retraining  \- Deleting the offline speech recognition language pack (US English) and re-downloading  \- Clearing cache AND data from the Google app  \- Removing the latest update, and going through the above in an older version  &amp;#x200B;  Essentially, I've gone through all the troubleshooting steps I could find from Google and other sources. It seems like a security thing gone buggy but I can't for the life of me figure it out. Any help is appreciated."

"Hi All, I can't seem to find this issue with search.  &amp;#x200B;  Sometimes, when I try to set a reminder on my phone, it says ""Ok, would you like to save this?"" and gives me ""Confirm"" or ""Cancel."" If I hit Confirm, it creates a double reminder of the same thing on my calendar. If I audibly say ""Yes,"" it goes ""What's the reminder for?"" even though it's showing me what I just said.  When Google Assistant works correctly on my phone (most of the time), I can say, ""Ok Google...set reminder tomorrow at 830 PM to buy dog food,"" and it says ""Ok, I'll remind you tomorrow at 8:30 PM,"" it's in my calendar, and good to go.

"Hi everyone.  So I have this problem and it happens constantly. When I say ""Hey Google"" or ""OK Google"" the phone will vibrate (I have Galaxy S9) and I ask my Assistant something and it doesn't respond. Even when the phone is unlocked, when I say ""Hey Google"" the Assistant app opens but it doesn't record my question (I know this because those colour dots aren't moving) so I have to say ""Hey Google"" one more time for it to listen to my question.  Another problem is with the locked screen - sometimes the Assistant works okay, and sometimes it says that I have to unlock the phone to do something. I ask it to play something in Spotify and it tells me that I have to unlock the device to do that, and then I ask it one more time and it starts playing a song. Does this happen to all of you as well?  Thank you very much for all your answers!"

"I'm not sure what is going on. My setup is a Google Home Mini, a Chromecast (v1 I think), and a Netflix account that is linked thru the Google Home app.  For the past couple of days, whenever we try to watch Netflix, by saying ""Ok Google, play (show)"", the Mini responds as normal, and launches Netflix on the TV. For some reason, the Chromecast's ""Ready to Cast"" text shows up in German, before the Netflix app begins running. Then the Netflix app plays, and its subtitles and menu descriptions are in German. I have to go to netflix.com, navigate through German menus, and change the user's language to English and save it.  I've checked both the Home app and the Chromecast's settings, and they both say they are operating in English. I've also rebooted both of them. Once we stop watching for the day, and then come back the next day, it's in German again.  Any ideas on how to get this sorted out back to English?"
"Is there a command that will have Google assistant turn on location access? All it does when I say, ""Turn on location"" is open location settings, but when I'm driving I don't want to have to handle my phone."
"Hi all,  I recently got AA in my car. All works fine with my phone connected via USB.  I have one, but persistent, problem.  When I press the mic button, I can activate Google Assistant and use it fine. Any time after that though, it just flashes up really fast and disappears again (the black banner at the top). The flash has varying lengths and sometimes makes the beep, but Assistant is completely unusable. If I get a message through and click play, it just says ""something went wrong"". If I go into settings (on my phone, in AA) the settings fail to load.  It's like the assistant just dies after one use.  Has anyone come across this themselves or does anyone have any fixes?"
"I have created agent on google assistant. When invoked through google assistant to connect to the agent, it gave error response saying unable to connect.

"I don't know if anybody else knows about this, I can't seem to find anything about it.  Google Assistant was creepily mishearing a private conversation and thought I'd said ""tell Mr dice"" which apparently is somehow key to launching this male voiced dice roller.   He introduces himself, only rolls one single dice on command and then immediately leaves the conversation.   I can't figure out any other way to launch him other than saying ""tell Mr dice"", and he doesn't seem to recognise any other commands or questions that aren't related to rolling a dice.  Anyone else know much about Mr Dice?   I know Google Assistant now does this dice rolling function herself, is this some kind of vestigial thing?   I was kinda spooked out to meet him during a completely unrelated conversation!  Screenshot here: https://imgur.com/a/WuTc5AU"

"Hi, very recently I have encountered a problem when using Google assistant to tell me my notifications on my pixel buds. It starts normally, telling me the time and how many notifications I have.

" I use Google Assistant and link to Spotify, and when I say “Play [album name]”, then Spotify opens, but music doesn’t autoplay.  I’m using newest version of Google Assistant and Spotify.  Can you help me?   Thank you so much."
"Just try it.  * Say, ""Hey google, play the news."" * It will say ""here's the latest news"", then a screen will come up showing sources. * Listen for a second, the press pause. * Now you have a notification (with the ""Google"") app and three buttons. * You can swipe the dialog, but it is the type that can't be dismissed. * You can say ""stop playing the news"", and it responds ""Okay"", but the dialog is still there. * If you tap on the dialog, you can get back to the screen with the news sources, but there is no close button, exit button, menu option, etc.  Great job, Google! Now my morning routine is to play the news and when I'm done, then what? *Reboot my phone* to get rid of the dialog?  Sorry to be negative, but Assistant has so many bugs that I've lost patience. Does the Assistant team test anything, ever? Do they even try using their own software at least once before releasing it?"
"When dictating messages in English, Assistant faithfully converts each ""comma"" to ',' and every ""exclamation mark"" to '!' and so on. With Norwegian this does not happen and it instead types out the punctuation as a word. Does anybody else have this problem?"
A big implication of moving the processing onto the device is improved privacy. But that only works if Google doesn't later upload interaction history to its servers. Does anyone know whether/how the terms of use have changed? Are there any assurances? Or does Google have the right to use everything as it sees fit?
"So in light of Google IO news that Google Assistant will essentially be ""offline"" and 10x faster I'm wondering how long we think it'll take to get to ""normal"" phones. I know Google isn't great about meeting feature deadlines and benchmarks (still waiting on Google Voice to be able to send a text through Assistant). BUT whats the general timeline on these new features that are ""Pixel Exclusives""? If the GA makes it to Pixel late this Summer whats the estimated timeline for the rest of us poor sods getting this feature?"

"I know this is a lot to ask, but I the only thing I know how to work with is really simple, IFTTT. I have no idea how to use tasker and I would like to learn. The first thing I would love to do, is a command on google assistant, If I would tell him for an example ""hey Google, add this song to my playlist"" the song that is now playing on Spotify, would be added to my playlist. I don't want to buy some subscription for this, I looked if I could find a way to download cracked APK but there is not really a one with the newest version so I do not have AutoSpotify (really don't want to pay for this). I looked on the internet and there is one discussion about this, but the guy is like oh yeah and then make a script that looks like this. I have no idea how to create a script and I have no idea what to do with it. So does someone know how to do this step by step?"
"Hello all. First time posting and on mobile so please bear with me.  I'm running One UI on a Galaxy s8. Before the update, Google Assistant and voice match worked perfectly fine. After the update, Google never responds to the wake words.  I looked in the settings, and found that voice match was turned off.  However, every time I try to flip the switch on, it says that Google can already recognize my voice. I hit okay, but the switch still stays off and voice match stays off.  Additionally, I am not able to retrain or delete the voice model. Pressing those buttons does nothing.  I've tried to delete the voice data from my old phone, but it didn't fix anything."
Basically title. I have to get very close to my phone to use google assistant instead of it just picking up my voice from a distance. Not sure why.
"So I mainly use the Google assistant while connected to the car's Bluetooth. I own a OnePlus 6 and when I say ""hey Google"" it wakes up the device. First time I say ""hey Google"", screen wakes up, command is being registered, all good. Second time, all good. Third time, screen isn't being unlocked/turned on, but I still get that sound indication that the assistant is listening, so I unlock the device and then say my command, which is being registered. Fourth time, Google assistant just doesn't respond anymore. Not waking up the device, not listening, no sound indication and no listening animation.  Nothing.  The only way to solve it is to go to Google now screen and click on the microphone icon, then the old Google  voice (not the assistant) starts responding.  The third step is always being followed by the fourth step. always. I reflashed the stock ROM and updated it many times, but the problem persists. Cleared cache etc. , Didn't help.  It happens only when connected to Bluetooth in my car.  Does anyone else experience the same issue? Does anyone know how to fix it?  Thanks!"

"So my work is using the planbition app to get me my agenda. Sadly I have found no way to sync that to Google agenda so I'm looking for an easier way than to put everything in manual.  Since my work only has 4 shifts I tried using a routine which, when I say shift 101, adds the set shift to my calender. Sadly this way always put the shift down for tomorrow which is not what I want I want.  Basically I'm looking for a way to have Google remember what shift 101 is and than put in in my agenda on the date I would like. Does anyone have an idea how to make this work?  Alternative if you know of a way to sync a third part app to the calender would be even better.  Thanks"

"For some time now I've been experiencing an issue where when using voice commands to call or send texts Google Assistant is confused who I want to communicate with.  Example (names changed for privacy):  I say: ""OK Google, send text to Krista Smith, What time is dinner?""  Google Assistant then asks: ""Which Krista do you want to send to? Krista Smith, Krista Jones, Chris Johnson?""  I say: ""Krista Smith""  Then Google Assistant sends the following message to Krista Smith: ""Smith what time is dinner?""  It appears to be disregarding the last name when I say Krista SMITH.  Any idea why this is happening? or how to correct it?  I would like it to send to Krista Smith 99.99% of the time as she is my wife."
"I've been using the Google assistant in my car that has android auto for well over 2 years. I HAVE NEVER TAKE THE INTERSTATE/HIGHWAY TO WORK OR ON THE WAY HOME FROM WORK.

I'd figure it would learn but it has not despite using location history etc. I will use the interstate just never on my work commute. Why hasn't Google figures this out or how can I specify this?"

"Ok! Motorcycle &amp;  Google assistant enthusiasts, I need to pick your brains.  The idea is to have a simple physical button mounted onto a motorbike which then activates the Google assistant on the phone to do my evil bidding whilst riding along - directions (gmaps), music changing (Google music/Spotify) are the main contenders here. All of this can be achieved through android auto through the digital microphone button, which is great, but having a big set of clunky gloves on means an external phyisical clickable button is a requirement.  Has anyone got a simple set up they use?  * Looking for a button on the handlebar area, not a scala-esk button on the helmet *Ok Google Voice detection is ok, but im after the button approach.  Thanks  in advance!"
So I read a games article which Google translated from Spanish to English a couple week ago and now I keep getting articles in Spanish. I had the same thing happen with Russian few months ago but when I said no more stories in Russian I didn't get anymore. However I have now removed 5 6 articles from feed clicking do not show stories in Spanish for the next day to have Spanish article again.  Guess I'm gonna have to learn Spanish..

"Some people may not have this issue, but when I'm using GA to call someone - almost 100% of the time in my starred contacts list - it either fails to recognize due to an alternate spelling or constantly takes extra unnecessary steps to verify the contact I intend to call.   Example 1:  My brother's name is Landen, spelled with an E. When I ask GA to ""call Landen"" it lists the two Landon's I have in my contacts, whom I have NEVER called before. Even after deleting those two contacts it doesn't recognize my brother's spelling.  Example 2:  I ask GA to ""call Lauren"" and it says ""do you mean call Lauren P\_\_\_?"" Yes, of course I mean that, I meant that the last 50 times I asked you to call her. She's the only Lauren I've ever called, and the only Lauren in my favorites. Why won't it just default to the favorite instead of going through this unnecessary two-step process? (Now, I know at this point I'm just nitpicking about an extra 10 seconds, but when it worked perfectly with iOS, it can be frustrating that it takes more effort on Android).  Does anyone have any suggestions? I've already tried adding phonetic spellings to names and that did nothing."
"I have a Motorola E5 Play. I've never had an issue with it before, but I'm having one now, which is really ruining my whole experience with it. Basically, whenever I plug in headphones with a mic, it will falsely detect an ""OK Google"" and pull up Google Assistant from nowhere. This is really annoying, as it will stop any other media. This is really annoying when I'm on a bus or something, and I constantly have to start up my music again every 2 seconds. It will also repeatedly play/pause my music without me even doing anything. It will also play with the volume, both Media and Ringer. I've tried this with several other headphones, and this seems to only happen with ones with a mic. Any solutions??? I emailed both the headphone manufacturer, as well as Motorola. I've looked on the internet extensively as well. So far, nothing. :/ Any solutions???"

"Hey, so ive recently got my google home mini back off my dad  (He was testing to see if he would use it before buying one). And ive decided to use it as my alarm from now on forward. I work in retail so my shifts are constantly changing.  Some of my shifts begin at 7:30, so I need to set an alarm for 6:30 allows me to get up changed breakfast and the cummute to work.  However, some others wont start will 9, maybe 12, maybe 1 etc.. you get the idea, im curious to know if you can change your alarm (same alarm just different time) depending on my shift start. So for example, if i start at 7:30, it'll go off at 6:30. If I start at 9 wont go off till 7/7:15. and anything later alarm sets to 8:00. I dont mind once a week adding my shifts to a calendar and allowing it to read from that, thus allowing it to know when my shift is to set the alarm for the right time.  I know a bit of a long winded and potentially confusing one. Any questions or even just a lead then hmu. Anything is appriciated.  Thanks."

Additionally, the new Google now side bar just gives articles and news as default.

Because I have a Google home, I don't want my phone to unlock and wake it's screen everytime I say ""ok Google""   2. When the screen is unlocked, I want to have ""ok google"" detection enabled. So, when I have everything ""off"", and call my Google home, I still see screen on the phone (if unlocked), saying enable ""voice match"". This is nuts.   Any suggestions on how to do the above.

What I would like to be able to do is send a reply back to the device that sent the message... For example if I tell my phone to have my computer start a movie on my computer and for whatever reason my app can't find the movie I want to be able to communicate that back to the device that originally sent the message, whether that be my cell phone or tablet or Google Home smart speaker.  I know there is probably no official way to do this but i'm looking for creative solutions (like the one I use to get the message in the first place)... anything at all that works even if it involves multiple third-party services."

"I'll put this here just in case someone is having the same problem.   A few days ago my assistant begun showing the first 3 or so news in languages I usually literally can't even recognize.

"Hey all, I'm trying to find a way to set a sleep timer AFTER the ""And then play..."" action in a routine.  Basically, I just want to set a sleep timer for 1 hour at the end of my bedtime routine. So right now I have it set to ask me what time the alarm should be set for, turn off all the lights, set the media volume to 20%, then play Sleep Sounds.  The issue is, there's no way to set a sleep timer at the end of this routine. If I add it as a custom action (ie. just type in ""set the sleep timer for 1 hour"") it just says ""The sleep timer can't be set when there is no media playing"" then it starts the Sleep Sounds.  There is no way I can find to add a custom command AFTER the ""And then play..."" action, so therefore every time I run the bedtime command I have to wait for it to start playing the sleep sounds then tell it to set the sleep timer.  Anyone know how I can add the sleep timer into the routine?  Thanks!"
"It used to work great.  But now when I say ""ok Google, play Mudhoney on Spotify"" it will say ""ok, playing Mudhoney on Spotify"" and Spotify will open and nothing happens.

"My previous post outlining this frustrating inconsistency was [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/googleassistant/comments/aob2z1/notetaking_via_bt_headphones_vs_phone_mic/).

However, if I activate the screen and unlock my phone first, then the same command, delivered via the same headphones, will result in a note being created in the weird Assistant ""netherspace"" which is definitely not Keep, and can only be accessed by voice command.

Today I got pretty frustrated with it and was testing heaps of phrases out. 95% of the time it was wrong, sometimes laughably completely different. Has anybody else been experiencing this?"
"So, this is infinitely frustrating, and I don't really anticipate getting any resolution here (but I'll eat my words if I'm wrong!!), so mostly I'm just venting. I've posted before about my aching desire to have my phone's Assistant function upgrade, such that my notes and lists are once again integrated with Google Keep, as has been promised here on reddit for many months, and was once the default behaviour years ago. For the longest time, anything I recorded by voice command via assistant went straight to the atrocious shopping list ""app"", even if it didn't remotely resemble a shopping list item. More recently, this changed so that vocally requesting a new note or list would create such an item, no longer attached to the horrid shopping list, but existing in the grey Hades of the Assistant itself, available for review only by verbally calling it back again, and having no other functionality (can't delete line items, share, reorder etc).  &amp;#x200B;  Meanwhile, apparently others have had Keep reintegration for many months already! But it's pushed from the other side, and there seems to be nothing a meager beta-tester like myself can do to hasten the transition. So imagine my elation when today, quite by chance, I try and create a new note by voice using my bluetooth headphones, and lo and behold googlevoice announces she's saving my note in Keep!! Sure enough, there's my note, right where I always wanted it! But wait... after a few more successful trials, I switch off my headphones and try again just speaking to my phone, using exactly the same command. And.... failure, it went right back to Hades to join orphan limbo for eternity.  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry for waxing metaphysical, it just feels at this point that google, much like the universe at large, has it out for me in particular.  &amp;#x200B;  ps I have noticed that even though I have security (fingerprint etc) always enabled, and have not added these headphones to my ""trusted bluetooth"" exceptions list, I can press and hold the ""call"" button and receive a voice prompt ""voice dialing"" - which I expect is a function meant to allow me to call so-and-so - but I can instead treat it like I had just said ""OK Google"", and even though it never turns on my phone screen or deactivates my security, I can nevertheless give full voice commands to the Assistant, including ""tell me my schedule"", ""read me the news"", and the elusive ""make a new note"", which it then saves to Keep (then and only then). And now I'm out of my depth, I imagine this is all connected somehow, but I can't figure how for the life of me. lil help??"

When trying to send text it can hear  all my words perfectly including ""send, change it"" within the message  But when it asks me what I want to do with message and I say ""send it"" it doesn't understand me! Grrrrrr..   Also adds its own words to each message  "" problem. What's the message?"" "

"I drove a family member to the airport today and noticed I was low on gas. I get forgetful when driving sometimes, so I worried I'd forget to stop at the gas station nearest my house and would just proceed home. So, in a burst of inspiration and having no idea if it would work, I said to my phone (Pixel 3 XL), ""OK Google, ""When I near the Example shopping center, remind me to get gas."" Lo and behold, Assistant said, ""OK, when you reach Example, I'll remind you to get gas at example address,"" or something similar to that. Awesome!  Sadly, when I reached Example shopping center, no reminder appeared. I got gas at that address, exited the shopping center, and no reminder.   The phone was locked when I reached Example shopping center--maybe that's why? Or maybe this function just isn't ready yet?"
"Hi all... so like the title says, I'm fresh out of the Apple ecosystem and on Android/GalaxyS9, and while I seem to have most things I was looking for figured out, I'm stumped with finding a notes type app that integrates with Google Assistant.  One would think that Google Keep (which is where I migrated all 40+ of my iOS notes to) would be smoothly integrated with Google Assistant... but I guess that isn't the case, for me at least... for the life of me, I can't get Assistant to link to Keep. When I try to ask Assistant to take a note, it takes it, but it puts it in this little simple List/Notes app that seems to be only internal to Assistant, and the note never makes it to Keep.   Some web searches seem to indicate that Assistant+Keep does work, but I'm seeing others that have the same issue as me. So, questions below:  * Do any of you have Keep+Assistant successfully linked? Any of you with an S9?  * Have any of you also failed to get Keep+Assistant integrated? on an S9 by any chance?  * If Keep+Assistant isn't an option for me, does Assistant integrate with any other apps designed for notes and note taking? I manage to get Todoist linked to Assistant for short reminders... so for this, I'm looking for something similar to iOS Notes, being more suitable for long form notes and that those notes can also be accessed from the web or desktop app.  I'll take any help / troubleshooting / advice I can get. Thanks!"
"I have a home automation system that's about 5 years old and has had incremental add-ons during that time, so it's not perfectly designed by any means. We're now thinking about switching from the Echo to the Home Hub for purposes of voice control.  We have: * Smartthings v1 hub -- water sensors are our primary devices still attached to ST. * Philips Hue -- multiple lights in each room, and some fixtures with multiple bulbs. Lights are in the kitchen, back hall, living room, bedroom and front hall * Leviton light switches -- four switches control 10 lights in our master bath * Kasa/TP-Link -- Certain lamps with unusual bulbs use TP-Link smart outlets  Here are things I'd like to be able to do with Google Home Hub that I'm currently able to do with Alexa: * Turn on and off all living room lights (combo of TP-Link smart plugs and Philips Hue bulbs) * Turn on and off all of the lights except in the master bedroom with a single command -- TP-Link, Hue and Leviton * Control lights individually and in groups in the master bedroom -- these are all Hue lights, and we can tell Alexa to turn on/off both nightstand lights, or just mine or just his, and to separately turn on and off the overhead light.  The Hue isn't great when it comes to groups of lights because, as far as I've figured out, bulbs can only belong to a single room. (So a light can't belong to the master bedroom and to a group called ""upstairs,"" for example.) Alexa supported groups, but I can't figure out how to get the Home Hub to do the same.  The other thing Alexa allowed me to do was to include different types of devices in a single group. So telling her to turn the living room lights on and off allowed me to include both Hue and TP-Link smart switches.  Can I do this with the Google Assistant? And am I doing it at the Assistant level or the Smartthings level? (I must also admit that Alexa was so awesome at recognizing new devices that I haven't added most of these to ST.)  Thanks!"

"I tried searching this sub for an answer to this question before posting, so if I missed some threat in the past that beat this topic over the head, I apologize. I also searched Google's forums to no avail.  I have a ""good morning"" routine set up so that when I say, ""OK Google....good morning,"" Assistant will give me the current time, weather forecast for the day, and travel time to work (factoring in traffic and such). Every single morning, Assistant tells me, ""here are some things you can do when your phone is offline..."" instead of running the routine. If I speak the command a second time, it will run the routine as it should.  My phone (Pixel) is not in battery saver mode. It's running on my home wifi, and it is almost always at 98-100% charge when I run this morning routine.,  The one workaround I've found is to pick up the phone, unlock it, hold the ""Home"" button to activate the Assistant, and then say, ""good morning."" I don't get the error in that case.  Anyone have an idea what might be happening here?"

"Hi,  &amp;#x200B;  Can you make your assistant ignore certain commands?     My wife and kids have a bad habit of not planning what to say to the Google Home prior to them saying ""OK google"", therefor they sometimes stop during a command.. That is not a problem most time, as they just start over.     But when they want to turn things off, but they pause after saying ""OK google; turn off........"", then the assistent turns off everything ""smart""-thing in the house. Including SonOff-power plugs (plex server) etc..  &amp;#x200B;  So can I make my assistent not accept a command? I realise, that then we won't be able to switch everything off, even if we want, but I don't have use for that, so I would rather make sure, that it doesn't happen at all"

"I have a Samsung Galaxy note 8. I am trying to set up Google Assistant (GA) to send notes to my Gmail when I use the ""Note to self"" command. The problem I am having, is when it is set to do that, I am getting an error message when it says ""saving"" that says "" To send a message, enable account sync in Gmail settings"" . I have followed all the steps to ensure my account is set to sync, and in fact I can command GA to send am email to so and so, and that will go through every time, but not the note to self's. Every once in a while it will actually send it through, but any follow up attempts results to the same error as above. I have updated and reverted to different gmail apps, app have cleared Cache and restarted, I have even factory reset my phone, only to find the same issue.

"So 3 days ago I had an LG G5 running android 7.0. Then I ditched it and got a Samsung S8 running android 8, huge upgrade. After so when I was setting up my assistant with some friends, I noticed that not all the features were available. For example when I had my LG, I would ask GA to sing me a song it would, but when I try on my S8 it doesn't. It replies by saying ""I am no diva"". So I thought it was being sarcastic and so on... I tried at least 5 times same results. So today I was with my friend who uses an iPhone 6S and had GA installed (to my surprise... didn't know it was available on iOS). So he asked his GA to play a game which it asked which one and he said trivia... So I asked my google the same question but it gave a weird and different result that it got from the web. So I took his GA on his iPhone and asked it to sing, which it did... But when I asked mine... it just gave the same reply: ""I am no diva"". But the most disturbing part was that I could do that on my LG G5 but can't do it on my S8!     Can anyone help me?"

"Hello,  I am unable to figure out how to re-enable the beep after the google assistant is triggered via holding down the home button or triggered from a ""voice assistant"" button.  I frequently use the google assistant via my Bluetooth earbuds as I use its dedicated voice assistant button to trigger the google assistant and input voice commands. It's super useful to have the confirmation beep come on to let me know when I can start speaking/ know when the assistant is listening. It is working and listening, I just miss the confirmation beep tone.  There was a google app update to version [8.91.5.21](https://8.91.5.21) the other day and since the update I no longer get the beep confirmation tone. This was working fine before the update as I use the google assistant almost daily. I can also not seem to find an option for this anywhere in google or phone settings.  My Hardware:   \- Samsung Galaxy Note 8 running Samsung Experience 9.0 / Android 8.0.0 with Nova Launcher. Android security patched / Updated to Dec 2018.   \- Jabra Elite 65t Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds. Firmware updated to 2.25.0 /  December 5, 2018   I have tried the following troubleshooting steps I've found online:  \- Turning up Media/ System volume, mute, unmute, loud, vibrate only, disabling DND, Rebooting, Shutting down the turn back on, un-pair/re-pair Bluetooth pairing to earbuds.   \- Enabled a random app to On under Accessibility &gt; Services (looks like that has fixed the issue on previous versions (google now), have also tried toggling off and on a few services to no avail)   \- Cleared Google app data and cache  Some links, I've followed:   [https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/17/tip-get-ding-sound-ok-google-command-enabling-one-accessibility-service/](https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/17/tip-get-ding-sound-ok-google-command-enabling-one-accessibility-service/)   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScTbt0i3Txs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScTbt0i3Txs)   [https://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s6/725336-tapping-google-mic-doesnt-have-sound-effect-anymore.html](https://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s6/725336-tapping-google-mic-doesnt-have-sound-effect-anymore.html)  After some digging though google settings and testing, I'm able to activate the Google assistant by voice through my Bluetooth earbuds and have a confirmation beep, but that also unlocks the screen, which is not ideal when phone is in pocket. The voice button trigger activates the assistant in the background, without turning the screen on, but does not have the confirmation beep.  My google searches have returned fruitless for a solution (or maybe I'm just terrible at googling), but I am out of ideas, short of resetting my phone, which I'm trying to avoid. Please don't tell me they removed it by design, the beep is so useful!  Any help to get the confirmation beep back would be super appreciated. Cheers!"
"I few months ago I learned of a fantastic workaround to create a multi-artist radio station in Google Music by creating a playlist with a few songs from each artist and then using the ""Start Radio"" option.

"In November, Google posted [this blog update](https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/7-ways-google-assistant-can-help-you-survive-holidays/) regarding their implementation of different positive responses when the request is phrased politely. They explicitly state:  &gt;Say “please” or “thank you” when using the Assistant and you’ll often be rewarded with delightful responses.  However I'm curous how the saying Thank You works. For a long time now I've wished they had a setting you could enable that would cause the assistant to listen for additional commands for a brief period after execution confirmation. That way if the user responded ""Thank you"" to the confirmation, the assistant could respond automatically with 'You're welcome' or w/e. If the assistant doesn't listen afterwards without you promting, can someone give me an example of an interaction with the assistant that would include ""Thank you"" in the request without awkwardly coming at the very end...  &amp;#x200B;"

Hello friends.   I had quite the issue with the clock app not showing the new Assistant Routines feature. I looked everywhere for a fix! So I played around with the apps. Searched through all the settings. Even looked on here for an answer. NOTHING. Eventually I found the answer by trial and error!   If the assistant routines function isn't showing:  •go into your settings &gt;apps&gt; clock  •Select permissions  •Tic Allow Storage   This should work. Perhaps close the app and restart. Also try restarting your phone entirely. Let me know if you have any questions!

"Is this a known bug? Or did I just get screwed for some reason. I was able to set my default Android Auto player to MediaMonkey in the AA app settings with no problem; however, when I try to do the same in the assistant app (as it didn't seem to work when I was using assistant during android auto use), even though the menu to pick your default music service looks identical to the one in the Android Auto app, I couldn't actually get to the screen I needed because the button that says:  ""Other music services (You can ask your Assistant to use any music app on your phone or tablet)""  will ""click in (the ripple goes off) but doesn't take me to the page to select more apps and ultimately does nothing.  The behavior is just like when you have a button like this in an android app with an empty OnClickListener method.  I feel like this has to be a bug, or google silently disabling the feature for now because of some kind of back end issue or support problem (I know in the past they disabled the ability to use anything either than Spottily or Google Play Music, though that seems to have been reversed).  Asking the assistant to play a song in MediaMonkey seems to have somewhat made it the ""default"" (so that I don't need to say with MediaMonkey but it will use that app), but in the assistant settings it still shows ""No default provider"" checked and there was a time or two when commanding it to play something without saying ""in MediaMonkey"" that it would say something along the lines of ""this artist is only available to subscribers"" as if it was searching Google Play Music instead. I have since disabled Google Play Music so maybe that would ""fix"" the issue, but it would be much simpler if I could just pick the app I wanted directly like you can in the AA app.  Anyone else experiencing this?"

"When I say ""note to self"" or ""add a note"" (or ""note to self buy milk""), Google should be directing that command to one of the apps that accept note commands, including Todoist, [Any.do](https://any.do/), Keep, Gmail, etc.  However, on my primary personal account, commands never get directed anywhere except to what looks like some minimal built-in note service, and there's no way to change the default app.  Here is a [video of the **expected behavior**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAzxekD4d4w) (using Google Assistant with a different account than my main personal account).

Additionally, sometimes I'll want to set an alarm or timer on a Google home other than the closest one.

I searched (in Spanish) and it seems that a while ago a male voice was made available for Spanish, but when I add any of the regional variants of Spanish to my assistant in addition to English, I get the female voice. When I try to change the voice, the only voice I’m able to change is the English voice. I tried changing the order the languages appear in, too, and nothing. I also tried asking my Home Mini in Spanish, “do you have a male voice?” and the female voice responds “I only have this voice, for now.” My region in the US, but I can’t imagine the male Spanish voice was released just in Spain or just in Mexico or anywhere else...right?  Also, my home is set up in English (eg, bedroom lamp, living room lamp, etc). I can’t figure out a way to ask in Spanish to “lower the bedroom lamp” since I guess you can’t mix languages in the same request. Is there something I’m missing?  Finally, is there some kind of publicized list of commands in different languages?"
"not working for me, when i say ""add contact"" assistant tells me ""i can't add contacts yet""  when i say ""add test to my contacts number is 1 23 4 5""  i get a search result from wikihow, or a youtube video on how to speed dial   ""view contacts"" will cause assistant to  opening: contacts  and open my contact list"
"Google assistant is writing ""cuz"" when I use it to text anyone. I don't use abbreviations in my emails or texting. I went as far as deleting all the learned data but can't seem to get it to stop.  Does anyone else have this issue or is it because of the way I'm saying the words?  Thanks! "
"I have a shared calendar (shared to my by my wife from her Google account) with full access. Sometimes GA sees it, sometimes it doesn’t (says, “I can’t find anything on your calendar”). Doesn’t seem to happen with my unshared (personal) calendar. Is this a known issue? Is there a fix?"
"I have several albums with a track that has the same title as the album. I used to be able to get the album to play by asking Assistant (or it might have been pre-Assistant) by specifying  ""Ok Google, play album X""  But for several months now, it always plays just the one song and quits, no matter how I ask. Observed on both Nexus 5 with LineageOS 14.1 and Pixel 1 with stock Pie. It's made playing music in Android Auto almost impossible.  I've confirmed in the transcript that it is hearing me say ""album"", it's just ignoring it. Has the command changed? I can't find it documented anywhere.

"I have a Samsung Galaxy J6 which I've activated Google Assistant on I used to be able to set reminders by doing the whole ""Ok Google"" thing, and if I wanted to view my reminders I would ask it to ""show my reminders"", and it used to do just that.  Lately, though, when I ask it to show my reminders, the reminders page briefly appears, but then it redirects to a google web page, [www.google.com/webhp?safe](https://www.google.com/webhp?safe)=active, leaving me unable to edit or view any of my reminders. I've tried looking up this web safe, but it's some kind of virgin app that I don't even have switched on. And if I search for Reminders on the phone, nothing comes up, so I can't figure out how to get to them without Google Assistant.  Can anyone help me to disable whatever it is that is causing this, or tell me how else I can access the reminders? They're a very handy feature and it's infuriating me not being able to use them."

"Hi,   I user a Moto G4 mobile with Android version 6.01.   In order to run google Assistant I need to physically tap the app icon, using a voice command ""hey Google"" or ""OK google"" doesn't work, there is no response.

"I thought this would be possible but I can't seem to find any reference or documentation about it. E.g. ""what is \[contact name\]'s address""? My contacts are all in Google Contacts and all personalised results etc are enabled.  Weirdly in the Google Assistant app, it often says ""ok, here is \[contact name\]'s contact information"" but then the written answer is just ""contact not found"".  Is anyone able to confirm at least what functionality I can expect? That will help me know if what I'm experiencing is normal!  Thanks"

"Let me tell you a quick story.  I just got my google home mini. I wanted to see where its storing notes (for obvious reasons, thats the whole point).   Not being stored in google drive, google keep, google calendar or gmail. So I figured I would download google assistant to see if its in there.  Upon installing, there was no prompt for a login or email to choose. Off to the races. So I asked it to read my notes.... no notes. Google home mini shows i have 7.  Google assistant used the email that i was logged in with under the google play store. There is nowhere to logout that I see. And my google mini is using a different gmail.  Long story short: I dont get to access my google home notes nor do I even get the piece of mind of knowing where or how they are stored. And I cant use google assistant.  AI sucks and so do logins."
"I have created a shortcut to open the google assistant (“Hey Siri, make yourself useful”), although it still doesn’t work as well as I would hope.

Does anybody know a way around this? I would like to make the google assistant available while my iPhone is still locked. "

"Hi, a while ago when Spanish became an option in the UK I added it as a language option. It immediately worked on our Mini but not the Home in the kitchen.

"I want to talk to Google Assistant a lot more, so I can ask for various things. Those things could be custom commands, such as ""What's for lunch today"", which sends a GET request to my own API, then replies back with the answer. I also want to do custom things like ""Turn off the TV in 30 minutes"", which sends another request to one of my Arduino compatible boards, which sends an IR signal to my TV.  &amp;#x200B;  However, I want to trigger all of those simply by saying ""Hey Google, do this"". When I go to create an action on Google, I cannot invoke it like IFTTT can. Why is that? I don't want to say a phrase like ""Hey Google, ask APP\_NAME what's for lunch today"" or ""Hey Google, tell APP\_NAME to turn off the TV in 30 minutes"".  &amp;#x200B;  Has anybody created an action on Google, which allows them to invoke it just like they want? But also read the response from an API and such."
"Is it possible to add a local and online services to the Google Assistant on my phone? The [Google Assistant SDK](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/) looks like I have to build device that similar to Google Home, I might build one or get a Google Home in the future but I prefer to use my mobile phone. I still don't know what are the capabilities of Google Assistant, but I want to control things inside my home using voice or manual configuration using my phone, wish these are possible.  As a developer, I prefer to build things on my own, but I'm completely new on Google Assistant. I saw some tutorials for home automation using Google Home and all of them requires internet, so there are few seconds lag before each command takes effect - hopefully there is a way to check local services first before checking online services.  Are these possible with the Google Assistant and can you please give me links for these? I'm trying to search but I can't find any good results. Thanks!"
"My attempt to google the resolution has failed, so I submit my request for aid humbly to those more knowledgeable than myself.  For the life of me I can not determine why it's impossible to use the assistant to order from Starbucks.  Every single attempt has followed the same pattern:  * ""Hey google, I'd like to talk to Starbucks"" * receive the prompt from Starbucks * state a drink order (complexity is irrelevant- plain coffee fails just as much as a venti soy latte) * voice assistant dies on the spot * sometimes voice prompt re-activates, however nothing is spoken  No matter what I try to order or the specifics of how I get to the Starbucks voice prompts, I never make it past this point.  I always end up breaking down and either just ordering when I arrive or using the app.  Judging from all the research I've done, it seems to ""just work"" for everyone else.  I don't even know how to begin troubleshooting this.  Hopefully someone here more skilled with this process than I can help me.  (full disclosure, crossposting to /r/starbucks)"
"I've noticed in the past week or so that setting a timer with the assistant fails about as much as it succeeds. The assistant shows some form of positive response such as ""Ok, starting now,"" but the text isn't read out loud and the timer doesn't start. Here's a screen shot of me trying to set a 30-minute timer 3 times in a row. After a few minutes, Assistant added the ""Canceled."" I didn't have a timer to cancel because it was never set.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/qu9mnn5b0h621.png"
Title.
"   I bought the 43UK6500AUA with *LG* SmartThinQ, did the google assistant setup. The ""Hey Google, ask LG to..."" stuff is working for me (cumbersome, wow, but functional). There is no option to register a second account on the TV for Google Assistant, so my wife cannot access this functionality. I can log out and switch to her account, then I lose the functionality...  Our other smart home products are all linked to both of our Google accounts and work for both of us. This TV, routing everything through a single LG account that is linked with a Google account, seems to lack the ability to respond to more than one user through Google assistant.  Am I missing something? Anybody know how I can have voice commands from multiple users control the TV directly? Would be nice if my whole family could have this feature.  I have chromecast, but there are voice controls available through the TV that aren't available through Chromecast. Would be nice to have the full functionality available to all users. If not, I just go back to chromecast and forego the extra controls/functionality available directly through the TV.   &amp;#x200B;  What a joke of a ""Smart"" TV, though. Very weak if this cannot be done."

All the marketing said ""we can play youtube videos"" i took that to mean, play yt vids as we are normally accustomed to.

"Is it possible to use iOS Shortcuts (or another app like Launcher Center Pro) to pass a custom command to Google Assistant?  What I want to do is create a custom shortcut where I am presented with a menu of choices (to pick from among variables) that I can pick by tapping on my phone that will then pass a complete command to Google Assistant. For example, I envision launching a ""Play Music"" shortcut that will prompt me to select from a defined list of:   * Speakers (e.g., ""Family Room"", ""Kitchen"", ""Whole House"", etc.) * Preferred Volume (e.g., Low (""Volume level 2""), Normal (""Volume level 4""), Loud (""Volume level 8"")) * Preferred music selections (e.g., ""My Relaxing Music station on Pandora"", ""Party Music on Spotify"", ""White Noise on Google Play Music"", ""Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, Opus 125 from my library on Google Play Music"" etc.)  I could also envision just having single tap shortcuts setup like ""Play my Solo Piano Music playlist from my library on Google Play Music on Kitchen speakers at Volume level 2"".

However, if I ask Assistant to set a music alarm, I get an answer of ""this is not possible on the current device"".  I have a new Honor 9 Lite with Andoid 8.0, and I am in Finland.   Question 1: Could this be a regional thing, not yet rolled out to Europe? Is there a way to get it to work?    Another thing: the phone came with a Clock app already installed (not the Google Clock) , and I installed the Google Clock for the Spotify integration. GA sets every alarm to this original app, and I can't uninstall or disable the original one.   Question 2: Is there a way around this, or am I just doomed to set my alarms manually like a normal human being?   Thanks for your answers in advance!"

The Action Is About Riddles You Can Use It In Your Google Assistant From This Link [https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000f392caebde?hl=en-IN&amp;source=web](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000f392caebde?hl=en-IN&amp;source=web) I Hope You Guys Will Give Me Some Feedback About It.
"Hey Google, Okay Google, we are all getting tired of saying it...     Whatabout a smart ring with its only purpose is to activate your Google Assistant on your phone. If you are at home, your nearest Google Home device is activated. If this already exists, thanks in advance. "
"Several of my smart things connected devices are showing up as switches and not lights, so when I say, turn the lights on, it misses them. Anyone know how to change the device types? For example, my blinds seem to show up as a light switch in the group and I can't disconnect them?"
I just spoke with Google help because I thought my assistant was broken because it no longer plays stored songs on my phone (Unless you subscribe to Google play and your downloaded song is in their online library)  I'm a musician and I need to be able to ask Google to play the songs I make.  So which digital Assistant will do this for me?  Can I keep Google Assistant for maps and use a different one for music?
"After browsing the web it sounds like Google Assistant is unable to interface with G Suite calendars at all, even if they've been explicitly shared with one's personal Gmail. Has anyone else had this same experience?"
Do I now have to have a Google play paid account?  How do I play music I own via Google Assistant? My phone is Samsung S7 edge
"I am driving and using the assistant. However, it's really annoying at night when the screen stays on. Is there a command to tell it to turn off my screen? "
"Just switched to Spotify, and I love it...except for using it with my Google Homes. I tell Google to play ""Sunday Morning Playlist"" on Spotify. And EVERY single time it plays Sunday Morning by Maroon 5.  So not only do playlists not work, I now have that awful song in my head. Thanks, Google. Am I doing something wrong?"
"I would like my assistant to choose a name for me, rather than me telling it what to call me"
"This software start any time when someone in my street said ""ok"" , when i listen to movie on my Phone and someone  said ""Oh Shit "" enougth  To stop the movie and show off.... I uninstall assistant,  I remove my Phone as a hardware... So i'm in the kitchen, someone in the living listen to some rock'n roll  and this troll show up to some drum beat that sound like ""Ok Google ""  This Things is really anoying !"
"Instead it should be like ""Hey Google, let's talk about Domino's Pizza"" and in the same voice it should help you order your pizza. But what do you guys think?"
I m using samsung galaxy s6 edge plus. I couldnt open the voice match. It seems grey and cant activete. Any solution for the problem ?
"I just recently started using Google Home and Google Assistant. Almost every time I open the Assistant app, it show me an updated ""Travel Time"" to home, but the problem is I'm already home, and I haven't been to these locations at all recently.   Is this a common glitch? I have had some devices stolen in the past and thought maybe it was picking up their locations, but the Find My iPhone app doesn't show at them online and never has. I've included some screenshots below to show just how far away it's showing me. Any thoughts?  https://imgur.com/gallery/DScSBzK"
"Hi Everyone, I am a college student looking for participants in a survey about what people like/dislike about Voice Assistants. If you have a few minutes, I would be grateful if you would take part! Thanks! [https://goo.gl/forms/3Bk3HQkL3J2MRQOj1](https://goo.gl/forms/3Bk3HQkL3J2MRQOj1)"
"As of today only, my google assistant on my Pixel 2 has started to not read out-loud the weather when prompted. It simply shows the weather in a format from [weather.com](https://weather.com) which it's never done before. It also cannot tell me whether it's windy or not anymore. Is anyone else experiencing something similar? ALL other voice commands work at the moment."
"Previously Google home responded to both 'hey Google'and 'ok Google', where my phone assistant only responded to 'ok Google'.   This meant that when I wasn't home I could use 'ok Google' to command my phone, and when I was home I could use 'hey Google' to command Google home WITHOUT triggering Google assistant on my phone. However all of a sudden now 'hey Google' triggers Google assistant on my phone and it opens the app, my Google home still is the one to respond and perform the command, however it's really frustrating if I'm watching a video or playing a mobile game as the Google assistant opens and stops whatever I'm doing.  Has anyone else experienced this and/or found a fix to it?"
"I have a smart display and GH mini. When I tell the LSD to broadcast, it would broadcast to the mini. However, It wont work the other way around. I suspect its because I have 2 google accounts linked to the LSD? I use 2 accounts so I could display photos from the second account. Any ideas?"
"I have some wifi connected power plugs that let me turn my lamps on and off with the phone. I can say ""Turn on the TV lamp"" and it'll switch on the lamp by the TV. What I'd like to be able to do is say ""Turn on the TV lamp in 4 hours."" Basically, a highly visible, yet subtle reminder to take my medication.  I can tell it to set a reminder or an alarm, but I can't see any way to trigger something more interesting.   Another example would be to switch on different lamps in the morning, one at 7am, a different one at 7:05, and a bright one right by the bed at 7:10. "
"It's minor but annoying to compose a text message and then have Assistant ask, ""Home, Google Voice, Fax, Work Fax or Mobile (the only number capable of receiving a text message)?""  I realize Google doesn't know what numbers can accept SMS, but is there a way to tell it so that when I message a contact I can skip that question? More than anywhere else, that question seems to hang me up when using Assistant with Android Auto. She keeps saying, ""sorry, didn't get that,"" etc."
"I do not have google home. I am only using the assistant through my phone.  Pixel 2 XL  I am on android v. 9 and the phone says the system is up to date.  When I activate the routine ""Good Morning"" all actions are performed except taking my phone off silent/vibrate. I am able to adjust the media volume, but not the ring volume. If I ask the assistant to ""set the ring volume to 50%"" is does not work either.   I tried to check permissions, but the assistant is not listed in the apps.  Anyone have a solution?"
"Why does Google always pick the most obscure remix or live version it has in its catalogue of whatever song I ask for? In retrospect, I'm sure this is a GPM search issue rather than an Assistant issue but am I missing a way of asking for a specific version by voice alone?"
"According to Amazon, [Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance A19 10W Equivalent LED Smart Light Bulb Starter Kit (2 A19 Bulbs and 1 Bridge, works with Google Assistant)](https://twitter.com/dealnews4u/status/1067348429498535936) is now 47% off. Is it worth it? Have you used this product? Please share your thoughts."
Is it me or is Amazon's echo just better at doing things than Google's assistant?
if it works for you what phone do you have? what version of Android OS?   and any other tips / tricks to make it work?  &amp;#x200B;  thank you !!!
"Hi there,  My household plays a lot of games and I'd love to create an action with google so that when I say something like ""Hey Google, we want to play a game"", the response would be ""OK, &lt;random name from household list&gt; should go first."" The trigger is easy enough, but does anyone have any ideas on how to get google to randomize from a pre-created list?   &amp;#x200B;  We've been using the ""roll a D4"" or ""flip a coin"" functions, but it would be nice for the assistant to just use names.

"Greetings Google-ers...  Seeking to add a video doorbell to my setup this year. I currently have a August SmartLock Pro I'm quite satisfied with. Would like to add their Doorbell as well.

"Hey Reddit! I did a quick search and couldn't find an answer here and have checked online elsewhere and am still at a loss.   Every morning a routine starts on my Google Assistant that gets all the Google home minis in my house to announce that no alarms are set, the meetings of the day, the weather and then it starts playing music. I don't remember seeing this up, and after a month of Google waking up the kids it's getting pretty old. How do I turn off the routine?   I'm running everything on iOS if that makes any difference.

"Dear all,  I'm Sergio Sayago, a post-doctoral Human-Computer Interaction researcher, currently at Universitat de Barcelona (Spain).  I'm  wondering whether you would like to help me out with a research study.  The study aims to understand and identify how the users of  conversational assistants - such as Google Assistant - think they look like, and  why. To this end, I, together with colleagues from Universitat Pompeu  Fabra (Spain) have created an online (Google Form).  [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHRQgZsei25Eh5-AcOTqX1sHB-IK7mxcxbw34cA3TsQKzZSw/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHRQgZsei25Eh5-AcOTqX1sHB-IK7mxcxbw34cA3TsQKzZSw/viewform)  This study has been approved by the Institutional Commission for Ethical Review of Projects at Universitat Pompeu Fabra ([https://www.upf.edu/web/cirep](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.upf.edu/web/cirep&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1543226137458000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFhl2nYe9h2wtZWq86ua-5QtBzB6w)).  I estimate that filling out this form will take you no more than 10 minutes.  I plan to share the results of this survey in my research blog ([sergiosayagoblog.wordpress.com](https://sergiosayagblog.wordpress.com/)).  Thank you!  Best,  \- Sergio"

"During sex I exclaimed “oh my god, OH MY GOD” and my google assistant said, “I hope everything is okay”"
"Hi, i just installed Google Assistant on my iphone and I have linked my Spotify account with the assistant but when I say open Spotify or play a song it just opens Spotify into safari browser, not the app... anyone knows if this is a currently bug or if i’m doing anything wrong? Thanks in advance!"
"Hi, is there a way to tell the google assistant to delete all my alarms? I tried saying pretty much every variation of delete/remove/turn off all my alarms but every time the assistant says ""you can do that in the app"" and opens up the alarm app and makes me do it manually. Does anyone else have this problem? Thanks"
"Greetings all, quick question.  I'm in an Apple household but heavily into Nest, so I thought I'd get myself the Google Home Hub for some evening routines; set Nest Secure to home and guarding, lock Nest Yale lock, etc.  I also have a MyQ garage door and I understand that I can link it to the Google assistant for $10/year.      The question: With MyQ linked, is it possible to have a scheduled routine (no speaking, just based on time) to make sure the garage door is closed?  Unable to test with the Assistant app on the iPhone.  Thanks!"
"My Pixel 2 XL has not received the new visual redesign. However, I do have the new visual screenshot page. My phone is completely up to date and so are all of my apps. I noticed that both my Android tablet and old iPhone have the visual redesign. 🤷‍♂️ "
"After yesterday’s new compatibility with Siri Shortcuts, I gave Google Assistant another chance, but when my phone is on silent, I’d like to be able to shut down the sound of the app.   I searched extensively but I can’t seem to turn off these spoken answers for the iOS Google Assistant app.   Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
"I am having issues getting the passive listening ""Ok Google"" feature to work. Voice match and the options that enable it are all greyed out.     This is the sequence of events now.  1) Delete cache and all app data for the Google App  2) Uninstall Google App  3) Reinstall Google App  4) Go to Settings &gt; Voice &gt; Voice Match  5) Access with voice Match is off but available. Everything else is greyed out.  6) Try and turn Voice Match on  7)  Here it diverges. Some times it would say to set the voice input to  Google, but the option in the settings is greyed out, and I'm  consequently unable to set upo Voice Match. Other times it would say  that Google is not the default voice assist App.  8) Set Google as the default voice assist app.    9)  Return to Voice match and be told that the feature is not availible my  my language, even though my primary language is set to English.  &amp;#x200B;  This is on a Xiaomi Mi8 with Android 8.1.0, MiUI 10.0, running the Ruthless Pixel Launcher."
"I'm sure most of us have android devices. I just switched to iOS and was frustrated by clunkiness of operating google assistant.  &amp;#x200B;  With the new Google Assistant app update, all of your google assistant actions become suggested shortcuts for Siri. This works great for home automation and media controls, YouTubeTV controls, etc that only work with Google Assistant.   &amp;#x200B;  So if you have an iPhone, update your Google Assistant App to the latest version. You do not need the Shortcuts app for this.   &amp;#x200B;  Open Google Assistant, give it a command, ie. ""OK Google, Watch NBC on Kitchen""  &amp;#x200B;  On the iPhone go to settings, Siri  &amp; Search, you should see ""OK Google, Watch NBC on Kitchen."" as a suggested shortcut.  It will prompt you to record a phrase to trigger this action through Siri.  I recorded ""Watch NBC on Kitchen.""  &amp;#x200B;  Now I just say ""Hey Siri,  Watch NBC on Kitchen.""  She opens google assistant and triggers Watch NBC on Kitchen through google assistant.  This is the fastest way to get YouTubeTV casted to my smart tv/chromecast devices.   &amp;#x200B;  I essentially picked 5 favorite channels and my two favorite devices and just recorded ""Watch \[CHANNEL\] on \[DEVICE\]"" 10 times.

Just turned on old Nexus 6P to try and it's working as expected...I can prompt by voice immediately.  &amp;#x200B;  Troubleshooting:  \- deleted and retrained voice model  \- uninstalled all Google updates and reinstalled  \- cleared Cache for Google, deleted data  &amp;#x200B;  I haven't done a factory reset yet, but that would be next step but I wanted to see if anyone else has had this issue.  &amp;#x200B;  https://reddit.com/link/9y7bhy/video/zy8rnr6u84z11/player"
"Google unveiled a new feature that allows you to reply to a Broadcast and it gets sent to your phone as a transcribed text.   There are a lot of stories telling you THAT you can do it, but none tell HOW to do it.    &amp;#x200B;  If I say ""Hey Google, Broadcast 'Time for dinner'"" and it sends to all my Google Home devices, what command do you say to reply and have it sent back to the sender's android phone?"
"When I have the navigation up on google maps while using my smart phone, google assistant can’t do anything that doesn’t relate to navigating. I’ll say something simple like “ok google, my sister’s birthday is November 10th.”  And google assistant will reply “I’m sorry, I can’t do anything with my sister’s birthday is November 10th.”  When i close google maps, google assistant is back to being smart.  It is quite annoying not being able to use google assistant in its entirety when you are using google maps. Even more so when you are driving and voice commands is all the more important. "

"I've had issues with location based reminders not working from Google Assistant from my phone or Home devices. I tell it to remind me to do something when at WORK or HOME and it is less than 5% success rate. However, if I tell my WearOS watch to remind me of a location based reminder, I get the notification both on watch and phone.      The ironic thing is my WearOS watch doesn't show correct WORK or HOME locations on the Google Assistant Screen.      It is enough to drive someone batty...     Anyone else encounter this? "
Can someone help me. When I ask google assistant to show me a video on youtube it just shows me a black screen. But when I minimize it it works. What?
"I remember seeing a while ago (seems like forever) that the Google Assistant shopping list was being revamped and would allow the use of Keep Notes. I'm also pretty sure I saw that it was ""rolling out""...where is it?!"
Title says all. It usually does so when I move.
"When I tell my assistant 'Goodnight' one of the routine steps is to give me my appointments for the next day. It does so perfectly ok with my personal agenda. However, my work agenda is in Outlook and imported into my phone through that. It does show in my calendar app (different color ofcourse) and in my [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com) desktop experience. However, assistant wont find it or update me on appointments from it...  &amp;#x200B;  any clues?"
Is there any way to set a reminder to actually be an Outlook task or do something similar?
Why in a new advertisement for google home do they call out 'hey google' this immediatly triggered my google assistant on my phone and i'm not wanting to have to shut ig down all the time.
"Hi all.  I'm trying to set up a routine in google assistant that when i say ""let's go home"" will set the thermostat to a certain temperature (i have a tado) and then give me direction to home (for traffic). The routines is one of the prebuilt into assistant and so are the two actions, no fancy commands here, but i cannot make it work. If i say the command, assistant only fires up the navigation (sometimes just provading the search screen of maps, sometimes going straight to the navigation itself). I could not chain in the two commands even changing the order of the actions itself.  Any ideas? Thanks"
"On our family calendar that gets created by default after setting up a Google family, I have an event for tonight. If I ask Google Assistant ""what's on my calendar for tonight"", she finds the event no problem. If I open the Google app, however, under Coming up for you, it says ""Your calendar is clear today"". For events on my personal calendar, the app shows those as well.  I don't want to have to enter all family events to personal calendars separately and don't feel like it should be necessary. Is there another workaround?  FWIW, Google Maps doesn't seem to show upcoming family calendar events either, so this doesn't appear to be strictly related to GA. Even so, I figured I'd start here to see if anyone else is seeing this."

Has anyone gotten sending text messages in a routine to work on the iPhone? Everytime I run my routine when it gets to the text part it just says oops try again.
"Hi, I am wondering if it is possible to make custom commands on Google Assistant without using IFTTT?

"I recently purchased the Insigna clock with Google Assistant and it is great. One thing I am looking to do with it is to create an alarm to use it to wake me up in the morning. So far, I've been able to do that. At the correct time, the alarm goes off. The one thing I'd like to do now is to be able to edit that alarm via an app or my phone. All I can see via the app is to delete the alarm, not edit it.  I don't want to have to say 'Hey Google, please change my alarm to 5:50' for example, as I head to bed while my wife is sleeping. She won't appreciate me having a conversation with my clock as she's catching her Zzzzz's.   Any ideas?"
Can Google assist turn you mobile data on your phone on or off?  I've noticed lately that you can toggle WiFi and Bluetooth so cellular data would be good to... 
"Whether from scanning a product's bar code or simply tapping a blue dot, the assistant offers an option to save the results in what appears to be a format similar to the one used by Google shopping list.  Where does it go and how do I actually get it into my Google shopping list?  I see share options, which include Google Keep, but I thought (hoped) tapping the save banner would automatically populate my shopping list."
"Having a weird issue.  When I have USB-C headphones (Google earbuds) plugged into my Pixel 2 and get an email through Gmail on my work profile, it triggers the The Big Adventure ringtone to repeat indefinitely and play over existing audio. Clearing the notification does not stop it. Unplugging the headphones does not stop it. Putting the phone on vibrate or mute does not stop it. Nothing that I have found can turn it off except restarting the entire phone.  This does not happen with Bluetooth headphones or with 3.5mm headphones via the dongle. It does not seem to happen with any other notifications. It also does not happen when the USB-C headphones are NOT set up to use Assistant.  I do have a sound notification when receiving Gmail messages under my work profile, but it is not set to The Big Adventure, nor are any of my notification sounds set to The Big Adventure.  Help?"
"When I'm home I don't want my phone trying to answer when I say OK Google, as I have a couple of GHMs, but I DO use it in the car occasionally.  Is there some way I can have GA turn on on my phone when I leave my house? I was thinking maybe as the WiFi disconnects, then have GA turn on voice control on the phone.  Would this be feasible, and any ideas how I'd set it up?"

"Hi, all. I've got a problem with SmartThings not unlinking from Assistant, and I'm now stumped as to what more I could do. Hopefully it's something simple that I've missed.  I recently tried to remove my SmartThings account from Google Assistant so I could switch out my hub. I removed it via Assistant Settings &gt; Home Control &gt; Manage Accounts &gt; SmartThings &gt; Unlink Account. The account was removed and it is no longer listed in the app as shown below.  With my SmartThings account **removed**, when I ask it to ""sync my lights"" it still thinks that SmartThings is connected and returns an error. Also, when I ask it to turn lights on/off, it says something about the SmartThings service experiencing issues, but these lights are no longer listed in the Home Control section of the app, so it shouldn't know their names anymore.  This problem occurs on all of my Google Assistant devices (phones, Google Homes, etc). The lights no longer show up under the Home Control section of the app either.  This leads me to believe that my SmartThings account isn't really disconnected from Assistant because it still wants to sync these devices.   Am I missing something here? SmartThings should be fully unlinked now, and I'm not sure what else I could do to clean out these residual traces.  &amp;#x200B;  [Odd behavior of the Assistant](https://i.redd.it/x3r3va02umw11.png)"
"OK, so I'm in my bedroom, which has an assistant-enabled clock in it. I need my phone to do something that it can easily do, but that the clock cannot. eg: Looking under the bed for a dropped pill bottle and say ""OK Google, turn on the flashlight.""  In cases like this, I almost always get the clock telling me that it can't do whatever it was **yet**.  How do I get around this issue? Thoughts?"
"Google assistant should have the ability to read what's on your screen. Before I switched to Android a few years ago, Siri was already able to read text that was on your screen just by saying ""read"". I am surprised why Google hasn't implemented this yet. It seems like such and easy and useful features to make."
Why does Google insist on providing commute information on the weekend? I’m sure like most people around here I only need that M-F.

"Greetings everyone.  I've been using Google assistant quite a lot for a coupe of months but after switching over to a new device, it doesn't seem to respond as smoothly as it used to. Specifically, I cannot seem to activate the assistant using just my voice as I did on my previous device.  When I go to my settings the Voice Match options is unavailable and appears grey.  Neither ""hey Google"" nor ""OK Google"" seem to be working. But if I activate the assistant by holding the home button everything seems to be fine.

I’ve got home devices all over the house including my kids’ rooms.  Is there to claim a home to be able to say turn off my lights vs speaking in the 3rd person to turn your own lights off?

Is there any way that you can get the Google Assistant to ask for the location when scheduling calendar events? I'm trying to schedule Gigs on the calendar using Google Assistant but it only asks me for day and time. I would like for it to ask me location. And possibly contacts to invite.
"Recently I tried saying ""Sync Devices"". I shouldn't have done that, because now the Assistant won't work properly. I only have ONE light in the kitchen but when I say ""Turn the kitchen light on"" it responds that it doesn't know what device because it for some reason thinks I have two lights there (when I say ""Turn kitchen lights off"" it responds with ""Turning 2 lights off""). The same with my living room - I can't say ""Turn the sofa lamp on"" it says ""I don't know what device you want to control"" presumably because it thinks I have multiple lights called ""Sofa lamp"" even though I don't.   I've tried to resynchronize my lights, delete Philips Hue account and relinking it, remove every light and reading them. Nothing works. Do anyone know what could be wrong? "

I have a Lenovo smart display. When I ask it to show me my playlists the one I use most often (Thumbs Up) doesn't show up. I can use a routine to make this playlist play but I can't get to it any other way. What gives? 
"I was very excited to start using Google Assistant instead of buying an Alexa, but I am having issues.  In addition to not unlocking consistently with my voice command, it won't perform simple commands. I said ""Play the song October by U2 on Spotify"" and it said ""Playing the album October by U2 on Spotify."" This happened several times. I also sunstituted tue word song for track.  So frustrating."
"For a few days now, the weather within Google Assistant on my Samsung Galaxy S7 (location in Korea) isn’t working. Questions such as “what’s the weather tomorrow?” Just give Wikipedia entries.  Weird things I noticed: 1) on top of the discover page within Assistant, the weather is shown correctly 2) other assistant functions that require a location such as nearest gas station are working -&gt; Assistant clearly knows my phones location  I read online that users reported such an issue some months ago and that Google seemed to fix it that time. Did it reappear?"
"When I try to send a text message on my Iphone XS Max (latest IOs), everything works fine until the very last step, when I have told google assistant to ”send” the message. At this point the messenger app is opened, with the correct text in it, but the message has not yet actually been sent. (And the assistant does not say that the message have been sent, which is true). I have to click on the send button manually in the messenger app. This happens everytime. I am on the swedish version of the assistant. On a similar notion, asking google assistant to play music will open upp Spotify, with the correct music, but without actually starting the playback.  This is very anoying! I would be very greatful for any help on this."
Has anyone else noticed that any GIFs in the assistant are displaying really tiny? 
"My problem is that I want my phone to use the metric system, 24h clock and to start the calendar weeks from monday, while using a all the bells and whistles (mainly the custom voices) of the US English assistant. Right now I'm using UK English as my phone's language and US English for the assistant, but the assistant still uses UK English almost exclusively. Is there any way to achieve what I'm trying to do?"
"Specifically, in my house I have an open concept downstairs, so there are times i want to be able to say ""turn on the downstairs lights"" and have the kitchen, dining room, and family room lights all turn on, and there are other times I want to just be able to say, ""turn the kitchen lights on"" and have just that room turn on.     It used to be just one room/device last time I checked (a while ago), but this is honestly the biggest thing keeping me from switching over to Google Assistant from Alexa. Thanks!"

"I tried setting up a routine to have the assistant call my phone. The sort of thing where I'd say ""OK Google, escape"" on my way into a situation I'd want to have an excuse to exit. Google would call my phone (or ring my phone) so that I'd have to excuse myself to take the call.  &amp;#x200B;  I tried setting up a routine for it, but it always responds with ""here are some search results"".  &amp;#x200B;  Any suggestions?"

"So many times I want to use Lens's ability to read text/numbers on my screen (reading text in an image to copy/paste). Evoking the assistant, with the phone unlocked, and asking ""what's on my screen?"" should let you highlight text or numbers from whatever is active."
"I'm having an issue on my Note8 whereby the assistant activates when I say 'Ok Google' but is not listening to my request after that. This only happens when my device is unlocked. From lock screen and manually activating works correctly. I've tried retraining, restarting, disabling etc  Does anyone have any thoughts what it could be? 🤔 Or has anyone else come across this? "
"Hey all, So I'm not able to find the shortcuts or routines settings in my Google assistant settings anywhere. Maybe it's because I'm in the Netherlands, but I have changed my language to all the different English settings and still no results. Any ideas on how to find it?"
I couldn't find anything in the Google App settings and the Google Assistant voice setting only allows selection of different voices but doesn't seem to allows speech rate changes. 
Doesn't seem to work on my phone. 
"Trying to narrow down if this is something related to my device.  Posted on Google support forums, and no real help.  Also can't find anything else online with this being reported anywhere.  About 3 weeks ago, I suddenly lost the ability to initiate duo calls from within Google Assistant from my phone.  No matter the command (""duo call contact"", ""video call contact""), Google Assistant responds with ""sorry, I can't do video calls yet"".   Duo works fine when initiating through the app.  I've uninstalled/reinstalled both duo and all Google app updates.  Have granted all permissions to Google app.    Anyone else experiencing this?  I'm using the V30 from Verizon (VS996)"
"When I squeeze or activate any other way, ""Ok Google, I'm home"" doesn't activate my lights or my furnace, I have to go into my Nest app... My previous phone would do it, but I don't know what to do. "
"Isn't this something Google advertises? I've tried many times to ask Google Assistant ""what song is this"" or ""what song is playing"" and have never gotten an answer. I've even tried it under controlled conditions with distinct, popular songs and no other nose. Every single time ""something went wrong."" This is especially vexing because the song recognition on my lock screen works really consistently, even at times when I didn't even notice music was playing.  This is on a Pixel 2.  Am I missing something?  (On a different note, it's really frustrating to say ""play (song) by (artist)"" or even ""play (song)"" and get ""ok, playing (artist) on Google play music.) I do pay for a subscription and this happens about half the time, but I'd consistent for every song/artist I've tried.)"
"Hey wondering if anyone else is having this problem. I'm trying to get my assistant routines to change lights to be on and off. So instead of giving it a custom text command I want to have it go through the common actions menu to adjust lights, thermostats, plugs, etc. But when I select the light I want to switch it doesn't save what I select. Anyone have any suggestions? Is this a bug?"
"This pops up randomly a few times a day.  When hitting the back button once, it goes to my Google app screen, then the second tap of the back button returns me to the app I was using.

"So I've added and edited multiple routines for my Mini on my Nexus 6p. Now Im on my iPhone and the routines are not available (only ""My day""). Languages are setup correct (US for the home mini, us on my iPhone). So I cant see the routines in my settings, but when I trigger a routine, I am able to change those routine settings by selecting that option from the Assistant chat interface. I just cannot add more routines or edit the triggger (cannot add the time trigger, but I can add an additional voice trigger). How does this work and why this discrepancy? Anyone experiencing the same?"
"When I say Talk to ring, uses my old account. Anyone knows how to sign out? "
"Wondering if it's possible for Google Assistant in Android Auto to recognise multiple voices giving the 'OK Google' command? Using a Samsung Galaxy S8 with a 2018 Ford Focus. It recognises me fine, but would be great if I could train it to recognise my girlfriend's voice too when we're both in the car.  I know she can just tap the microphone icon on screen, which is fine. Just wondering if voice recognition for 2+ people is possible as well.  I know there is a setting for 'Voice Match' in the Google Assistant settings which says I can add 'up to six people' - however, this seems to be on a device-specific basis, as it tries to find devices on the same WiFi network as my phone- which obviously my car isn't.  What I'd really like is the ability to recognise multiple voices regardless of device or platform.  Appreciate any help. Thanks."
Am I an idiot?  Or do I just not know how to talk to Google Assistant...  I litterally cant get it to do anything.  I'm useing JBL 10 and I cant tell it to play my ipod or read texts or anything at all. It just keeps telling me it doesnt know how.
"Hello guys! So recently I got a Huawei and I used Google Assistant to remind me to take a pill (useless info but whatever) however either I did not see the notification/reminder or it did not show up, anyone else having the same issue? I've got a Nova 3 with EMUI 8.2.0 and Android 8.1.0"
"I recently bought the JBL Everest 110GA headphones which are optimized to use with the google assistant. The first two days it worked great, but it seems like the assistant doesn't like me anymore.  With a lot of commands i don't get any response back, only with volume control i get a voice response and with play/pause the command will be executed but no response. When i ask for the weather, play a specific song, distance to home/work, i don't get to hear anything. Only when i'm lucky i get the last word of the weather report.  When i look at my activity i can see all my commands there with the expected responses. The assistant does understand me but somehow can't always get through to my headphones.  &amp;#x200B;  I tried reinstalling the headphones to the assistant, recalibrate my voice but so far no luck. When playing music the headphones work great so it should not be a bluetooth issue.    The phone I'm using is an Oneplus 3T."
"I called someone today and their google assistant said it was trying to connect and was unavailable, if I wanted to leave a voicemail. I have google Assistant on my phone but it doesn’t speak to people that are calling me while they are waiting for me to pick up. Is this a setting? "
"My Google Assistant on my Pixel 2 is taking more slowly for some reason. She sounds kinda stoned. Is there a setting for voice speed somewhere? When I go to change the voice (with the different color names), the speed sounds normal. It's only in the assistant app that it talks slow."

"Basically I want to say ""Thank you"" have it respond ""You're welcome"" and then close and return to the home screen. Friend of mine really wants that feature so I'm trying to find a way of doing it for her."
"The assistant only works when I open the ""Google"" app. I can close it and I can still wake it up by saying ""Hey Google"" but when I fully restart my phone I have to open the app first.  Anyone know how to deal with this?"
"I'm on beta 8.22.8.21.arm64 and noticed that as of Saturday (best I can tell) sending sms with Google Assistant is failing.

Anyone else on Beta Assistant having similar issues? I'm on Pie Sept 5 security patch on Pixel 2 XL"
Canadian English using Android and all the voice options sound identical. Help?
"With Google assistant being available in both Dutch and French, you would assume that you can get the app on the Belgian App Store. Yet it is nowhere to be found. Did I miss something?"
"Hello all!  I've just started using the assistant! My phone is a Moto G4 plus. I've French, Brazilian portuguese and US English as languages for the whole system, but in the language preferences, in the assistant, I'm not able to choose Brazilian portuguese.   Has anyone had this problem before?"
"Just got my S9 and enjoying tinkering with it.  Noticed talk about the new bilingual feature with google assistant, and realized it is not, obviously, supporting a ton of languages yet.  However, what's the word on Russian support?  I've enjoyed tinkering with Alica from yandex as being able to work on my Russian, but it's worlds behind google's technology (specifically in follow up questions).  Plus, my russian isn't very good yet.  It'd be cool to be able to use the bilingual feature to better my fluency in the language, especially in a country where you don't meet a ton of Russians (USA...  I've actually been surprised by how many times I've happened across a Russian speaker, or someone from a neighboring country that, as such, learned russian as well as Ukraine, Bellorussian(?), Georgian, etc). "
"It would be cool to be able to ask Google Assistant ""Show me your inside"" and see the actual inside of the device on your screen. It would be even cooler if you are able to tap on certain parts and show information about it (what it's called, what it does, and the technical specs). I know it's hard to build this for every device, so start with this project exclusively for the Google Pixel 2 (XL). "
"Keeps responding ""Sure, by the way, here are some details about our services"" and ignores my requests.  ""what is the temp in my house"" ""set temp to etc etc"" All these do not work now."

"Hi guys, Lately I bought a Pocophone but the Voice match cannot be accessed (greyed) and Google assistant cannot be triggered by 'ok google'. Can someone help me?"
"The assistant was released in my language a few days ago. I really looked forward to it, but now Im a litte disapointed that I have to go to the home screen with a push on the home button to be able to use it. The reason is that i for example want to make a voice activated note at anytime. Shoild it be like this or there a fix for this? Hjelp appreciated! "
I've just started using this but can't find a record of texts that I've had sent by google assistant.  I look in Hangouts and Google Voice but not there.  I know they're being received because I get responses.  Any idea?
"I used to have a galaxy s8+ and while Bixby wasn't that useful at all, the one thing it did do well was manage alarms. I am a really deep sleeper and have 30 something alarms and I was able to ask Bixby to ""Turn on all alarms"" or ""Turn off all alarms"". I can't seem to get GA to do it at all. This is particularly annoying because I either have to go through and make all my alarms repeating alarms or every night go through and activate all of them. To turn them off I either have to wait for the upcoming alarm notification or go through and manually turn each one of them off. Am I missing something or does google assistant not have such a basic feature?"
For both the main Google app and the Google Home app.  This was the only advice from Google (on FB) which worked.
"Continued Conversation has simply stopped functioning. It worked for weeks, but for the past three days or so, my Home and Minis quit responding after the first command and I have to say ""Hey Google!"" again. I checked in the app and it was still turned on, do I've turned it off, rebooted all the devices, turned it back on, rebooted etc... and it still doesn't work."
"I just asked google assistant ""What time is it?"" because I was testing my home settings. It just happened to be 5:55 pm. Its reply was  &gt;It's 5:55, if someone gives you a phone number starting with this, they probably don't want to talk to you.  The quote could be a bit off, but it was still surprising to get something other than the time."
"Hopefully this is the right place to ask.  I have a smart bulb that I'd like to be able to turn on and off with an icon or action on my phone, without having to speak. Is that possible ?  So for example create an icon and have that send the ""light on"" command silently to Google assistant ?  I currently have two ifttt buttons, but you can't change the look of the widgets"
"I wanted to use my Xbox or my TV, singed they already have all the services built in. The TV is also added to Google home since is part of smart things, but Everytime that I ask the lady to ,""watch xxxxx on Netflix"" it says there is no cast devices available."
"Hey all,    I have been waiting anxiously for the Google assistant update with the visual snapshot since its announcement and I can't figure out why it hasn't been rolled out to me yet. Is it not available in Germany yet? I am running android p on my 2XL but still have the old version.    Thanks in advance"
"If I'm in my car and trigger Assistant with ""hey google"" and then say ""navigate to XX"", there's a good chance Assistant will find multiple possible destinations and present then in a list (listed next to letters A, B, C, etc) and ask me ""which one do you want?"" and goes back to listening for my response.   If I say ""the first one"", Assistant appears to lose track of the conversation and just give me search results for the literal phrase ""the first one"".  I have tried this a few dozen times and it has never not heard me saying ""A"" as ""hey"" no matter how loud and precisely I pronounce the first letter of the alphabet, so it always breaks the conversation and responds to me saying ""hey"".  So my question is what format of response do I need to give for Assistant to start navigating to the desired destination?  So far, the best I've found is to just start over and ask for something more specific like ""hey google, navigate to XX on YY street in ZZ city"", but that gets old fast and I have to remember street names for everywhere for that to work.

I’m using a NVIDEA SHIELD TV &amp; have got on/off &amp; turn on specific shows working. But can’t figure out how to control volume through google assistant. Any suggestions?  Do I need to go to IFTTT?
"Before Routines were available for Google Assistant, I had setup several IFTTT applets to work with my Google Assistant and Google Home.  These were setup to work with my Harmony Remote.  But with Routines, I have completely removed IFTTT from the setup and started using the Routines.  But, for some reason, my Google Assistant still responds to the IFTTT phrases as if it is still using it.  I cannot find anywhere to remove those shortcuts that were setup using IFTTT.  Anyone have any ideas where to remove those?"
Google Assistant is crashing on my Galaxy S8. Tried uninstall/restart/install with no change.   Google product forums aren't lighting up so I'm thinking it's isolated.  Thoughts?
"I was excited about the new visual snapshot Google assistant introduced a month ago but I guess I shouldn't:  1) Content is poor. For example I have a flight tomorrow which Assistant knows about it (it gives me the information when I ask it what my next flight is). I see no card in the snapshot. The only cards I consistently get is calendar and my preferred stock. I think I haven't seen any other card so far.  2) It worked fine for few days but then I started getting the ""sorry, something went wrong"" message. I get this when I try to launch it from the Google assistant screen. I don't get it when I launch it from the Google feed screen which is weird.  Anyone else experiencing the same issues?"
"The latest:   ""OK Google, set an alarm for 20 minutes from now""  ""Can't reach Google at the moment""  This is with both Wi-Fi and LTE connections. Say it again, and you've a 50/50 chance of it working. Even if I wasn't connected, shouldn't it be able to handle simple commands like set an alarm or a reminder?   Not sure what's going on lately, but they've taken a great tool and now filled it with issues. Wish I could roll back to the old Oreo version - it worked better and faster. Friends with iPhones were always impressed with how quick it was and accurate unlike Siri. I no longer pull it out to impress any longer."

"I recently bought a new phone (lg v35) and everything so far has been hunky dory. My old phone assistant just straight uip would never work but thats a different situation, I hope. Today I went to send a text message using assistant. Hey google opens it up fine, I tell it to send a text and here is where the issue starts. it will no longer hear anything I say.

Is there any possible way to do that?"
What if Google open up their Assistant API so companies like anki with their new robot could pull information using their superior language recognition and information display and allow these companies to use their own voice so it could be a cue robot or a robot like jaris from iron man
I've been trying to find answer to this online but couldn't figure it out so just checking if anyone has been able to mute or disable the annoying beeping sound when you say OK Google or use the Google keyboard voice typing. I mean I guess no more annoying thing for me is how high pitched the sound is so  trying to disable it but really couldn't figure out how

So my Google assistant randomly decided not to work and the voice options are greyed out any idea on how to fix it??
Google Assistent just rolled out in The Netherlands so I wanted to add my Lifx bulbs. Somehow there is no Home Control button to add smart devices.  I'm I missing something?

"I live in the Netherlands and local news tells me that I can now use the Dutch language for Google Assisant on my phone (pixel 2). When I try to change the language via the Home app, it tells me that I need to change the device language settings. This is something I do not want. I personally hate it when device UI's are in dutch, I prefer to leave it on US english. All my devices interact in english, but I natively speak Dutch and would like to use the dutch language for Assistant.  So... can I leave my devie UI language on US English, and somehow use assistant in Dutch?"
"I think it might be the Green one or the Blue one (I'm leaning more towards the Green), but I really don't know. Which one is his?"

Its frustrating with my philips hue lights but google seems to swap off and on about 50% of the time....  I really wish it would use that AI brain and learn. I don't have a crazy accent or anything...
Launched today in the US. Anyone knows when it will be be available in Europe?
"So I am using an n-com headset in my helmet, calling up the assistant and telling it to play some music war a routine for more than a year now. But now, suddenly, it will not do it anymore, it will ask me to repeat the command and include a device to play on (like a chromecast or so). It works fine with Google Music, but Youtube Music is just a mess. Also it does work fine when I am just using the phone (no BT).   #WTFgoogle its like those days where you ask it to navigate HOME and it answers: ""Sorry, I cannot do that yet…"" and navigation voice commands are just out of reach for a day or two…   #wtfGoogle"
"I have a friend named Steve in my contacts, and it's now become a common occurrence that when I try to ""pause TV"" it will ""call Steve"". I ended up removing his name from his contact and just putting in a nickname of his that is different sounding.  Anyone else have issuies similar to this?"
"I have a single Philips Hue bulb in my son’s bedroom, as they’re expensive and it’s more than enough light for his room.  In Google Assistant I have it set as Ethan’s bedroom.  I then say, “Hey Google, turn off the lights in Ethan’s bedroom” and it works appropriately.  To make the phrasing a bit easier I changed it to just Ethan’s room.  However, saying “Hey Google, turn off the lights in Ethan’s room” results in Google Assistant turning off all 12 of the Hue bulbs in the house.  Why would simply changing bedroom to room cause this result?  I’m so confused!"
"I make reminders a lot especially for events in the future and I do not want to be reminded about them every morning.  As a test I made a reminder for a few minutes in the future. The notification that pops up isnt specific about the time-sensitive reminder, rather it just shows a total #/list of ALL reminders. This did not happen on my old Moto phone, but does happen on my S8.  On my old phone if I said ""remind me in 20 minutes to call my mom"", the notification would just say ""Call mom"" 20 mins later...   See pic of what I get now.  Any idea of how to fix this in notification settings? Tried toying with it a bit already.  https://i.redd.it/kn83vgqviwb11.jpg"
"Hi I don't know if this sub is the correct one for my question. I have the a Nexus 5X and I liked the feed or whatever the left homescreen is called. There where usefull traffic informations, where I left my car (missed this feature in my holidays last week), a very long time ago it also reminded me when I need to drive when there is a event with location in my calendar. For quite some time, it shows nothing but the weather and useless news, that I can't even deactivate. What happened? Did I do something wrong? Years ago I was a friend of customization but the pain of setting up a new device made me lazy so I now just go with default settings for the most part. That means I don't remember to fuck up my setting."
"Google Assistant will now be able to make video calls, including international ones on Google’s video chat mobile app [Duo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tachyon&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dxpag_hc_duo).

"I'm looking for something like a custom phrase like ""I'm up"" that does multiple things at once: Play favorites, set a timer, and turn off do not disturb. A bit of Google led me to 'Routines' but I can't seem to find them in the settings. (Google App setting &gt; Services has no Routines option) I found something close buried deep inside Explore in a preset good morning routine. It had an option  at bottom to add a new one but that can do only a single action.  I don't have Google Home and I'm on latest version on an Oreo device. Is this thing not available in India? Any alternatives?"
"How can I make my phone ring when I say OK Google where's my phone? I lose my phone in the bed or in the couch cushions all the time and I tried to say OK Google where's my phone but apparently a long time ago I set up a routine or something because Google says ""okay since you lose it every 5 seconds"" but it doesn't actually ring.   I've looked in routines and I don't have anything set up I actually just deleted every routine I had set up to make sure and I restarted my phone and I still can't get it to work.   Maybe I can set up a new routine and just have it before when I say ""make my phone ring"" but I can't find any action that will make it actually ring. I already tried having it set my volume to 100% And then playing one of my playlists on Spotify but all it does is set my volume to 100% and then it says I can search the web for that and it never actually plays my playlist like it is supposed to.   This is extremely frustrating because I feel like this type of thing should be built into Google itself without me having to try to figure out how to set it up"
"Hi everyone, I want make an app for Google assistant/Google home. So what app would you like having?"
"Latest beta update issue (on Oreo)...I'm in the Google app beta testing and not sure if this issue is part of that 'beta' update....     Before this update, I could just say 'Good Morning' or 'Good Night' (these are routines that are also customized), google would route that to GA and now after this update that link is broken!...now I get a pure google search for 'Good Night'.....sheesh!"
"So I just got an LG 49UK6300, 2018 model (comes with ThinQ, LG's 'AI' that connects/uses Google Assistant).     I've gone through the TV's steps to connect the TV to Google Assistant, the problem is that I can't just say '**Hey Google, turn off the TV**', I have to say **'Hey Google, ask LG to turn off the TV'**...as you can imagine, that gets kind of annoying.  Was wondering if there was any way to skip the 'ask LG' part.  I think for now I can make an IFTTT thingy to do it."
"I want to say to Google something like ""it's nighttime"" and it will turn my phone (pixel 2) on to do not disturb and switch off adaptive brightness. Is this possible?"

"Just got the latest Google update on my phone and I was playing around with the Routines. I have a Routine for driving to work and one for driving home. I'd like the news that plays in these routines to be different — that is, I'd like to have a different selection of news sources (essentially podcasts) play for each of these Routines. I set it for the morning routine (chose News, pressed the gear, selected the sources) and then did the same for the afternoon, and that changed the news sources for both Routines to the latter one. Is News something that has to be the same for every Routine. Is there a workaround (should one be News and one be Podcast, for instance)? Thanks!"

"Has any gotten OpenTable to work with Google Assistant? I can't get it work on any of my devices, all I get is ""I can't help with that yet""."
"I know for certain I used to send texts using Google Assistant while driving in my car. I haven't done it in a while, but I tried today and Google responded that it isn't available. Am I doing something wrong?"
"First of all I'm not too sure if I'm the only one having this problem but,  currently, I have galaxy s8+ and whenever I say ""ok google"" it seems to be recognizing it only half of the time. Is there a way to change the setting to make it recognize my voice or ""ok google"" command easier?"

"I have the new Google Podcasts app on my Pixel XL.  I've listened to several episodes of the well-known 'Serial Podcast'.  On my Google Home devices, playing podcasts works great.  I can say ""Play Serial Podcast"" or ""resume podcast"" and the GH service will pick up where I left off.  This doesn't work on my phone.  When I speak those commands on my phone, it does a search instead of playing or resuming the podcast.  Also, if I play an episode on my phone, Google Home resumes at the right point.  If I play a episode on Google Home, then try to resume on my phone by using the Podcast app, it starts playing at the last place I stopped on the phone instead of where I stopped on Google Home.  It seems that podcast integration had actually gotten worse since Google introduced the podcast app."

Since a long Time I see no overview about my daily appointments. Equal if i use the normal version or beta version. Ich tried evverthing but nothing helped. Mobile is a Samsung S8+. Any Idea what I can do? Because was always nice to see the daily overview of all appointments.
"I love Google assistant, but I've noticed a couple of issues. To preface this, my buddy is a Mac/iOS guy and I'm a PC/Android guy. We go back and forth with friendly insults and argue about which platforms are superior etc. One day we had a personal assistant shootout and these two issues arose. The first is that Google assistant can't start a stopwatch, but Siri can. I find this to be ridiculous because how could Google not have figured out how to implement this? It's such a simple tool! The second isn't really a huge issue but I thought it was funny. Siri will give you opinions on what she thinks are the best albums from various musical artists, Google assistant just looks up internet results. Any ideas on why these features are missing? "
"So I initially thought this was an Android Auto issue, because I noticed it first when I was in my car on the way home yesterday.  Come to find out, it might be an Assistant problem.  When I trigger Google Assistant and say ""Send Hangouts message"", I get back ""Sending Hangouts messages is not supported for this account"" all of a sudden.  Things to note, it's always worked before.  It is a G-Suite account, one of the older grandfathered ones.  Not sure if my enabling Messages online had anything to do with it...  I'm just kinda hoping this isn't an ""Isolated-to-me"" kinda thing and someone else has similar issues? :)"
"The last few weeks have seen reminders which were once incredibly useful to become a real pain. Mahy times I will set a reminder such as ""Set a reminder for 9am tomorrow to pickup groceries"" - before I'd see a full screen note asking if I needed to change anything. Now more often than not, get either a ""sure I'll remind you"" or a ""OK - what's the reminder?"" (which I already gave it. I'm also getting duplicate reminders - the original PLUS the second request for the reminder. Very annoying.   In addition, i used to be able to say ""View Reminders"" and see a list where I could add and delete reminders on my phone. Now the dumb thing will only tell me if I have reminders today - not future reminders unless I clarify ""View ALL Reminders"" and then rather than showing me a list, dumb thing wants to read them all outloud. And I can't swipe away reminders I no longer need if I complete them ahead of time.   Frustrating step back in functionality. "

I have noticed that recently (not sure how long it's been), if the assistant can't understand what I have asked it to do, instead of ""Not sure how to help with $whatever_action"", it says ""Not OK how to help with $whatever_action"".

I quickly rolled through the stuff then got the the voice and audio activity part and decided to check it out. As I scrolled down the list of commands I and my family had used on our Google Homes I noticed a strange transcripted command.  It said, ""turn on the fan"". I was confused because we don't have a fan connected to any smart plugs or anything like that. I clicked the play button to replay the clip, and to my surprise I heard the voice of a complete stranger.  I went over and asked my parents if they'd asked Google to turn on a fan at some point. I even asked them the specific date and time because the activity page has that. They affirmed that they had not.  I'm not sure what to make of this. This voice is clearly not someone in my family and definitely none of our friends especially given the time.  Has anyone else found audio clips of other people they don't recognize in their activity? You can check yours at myactivity.google.com."

"When I ask my Google Home Mini to play any song, genre or anything; my assistant starts playing or keeps quiet. In both cases it shows on my phone that music is playing and the timeline is moving forward. If music was playing from the start it usually stops after a few seconds \(±10s\). At first it thought it was just buffering, but that doesn't seem to be the case. My internet is reliable and no other devices have problems streaming music. For example: streaming news works just fine.  Whenever it '*resumes*' playing, it usually skips to the next song and plays that one instead of the previous \(original\) song it was playing.   I'm not using Spotify Premium. I'm considering it, but if my Assistant cannot play Spotify music properly it's not worth it. Is anyone else having this issue or does anyone know of possible fixes?   Is this a Spotify issue or Google issue?"

"I found Uber under services and linked my account, no errors. when i try to use google assistant to call me an uber, i get the message ""uber isn't supported on this device"".  i have a pixel 2 xl  anyone else see this?"
"I'm looking for the ability to have Google Assistant read feedback from a command. For example, read back the temp outside (number), is a door open (yes/no), etc, based on ifttt or even just the output of a command from a defined URL. The only way I've accomplished this is to have the script trigger a script to connect/cast a spoken string to a specific Home device, but I'd like to be able to ask upstairs/downstairs like normal usage and have the response follow me.   TL;DR I know you can control an output, but can I read an input yet?"
"As far as I recall (although my memory might fail me) on my old phone I could use the ""OK Google"" feature without being logged into any Google Account.  Is there a way to achieve that? I'm not willing to sacrifice my privacy anymore. Thanks!"
I was thinking of getting one when they become available at target but I'm completely new to the raspberry pi and programming. Is there a subreddit in relation to the kits? The only post I saw in search was an  old archived post. 
I'm doign academic research and try to understand why so many people did not use their voice assistant on their smartphone. It will be really nice to explain me your point of view   Thanks :)
"I want to retrain/delete my ""OK Google"" voice on the google assistant app.  I can not find the setting anywhere. I tried reseting all of my activity. logging out of my account in the app and deleting the app itself in an attempt to at least reset the app and maybe it'll ask me for my ""OK Google"" voice again.  But no, nothing works. I imagine my ""OK google"" voice is saved in the cloud somewhere and I can't retrain or delete it.  Please help."
Does anyone know of an app that can create widgets so that when I press the button widget it sends a command to Google assistant?
"My phone kept trying to answer but was overridden by my Google homes. What is the point of these devices if they suck at basic unit conversion, have no centralized timers, and are at best at a 30% success rate when controlling my home automation? I love my Chromecast audios. I hate every single other assistant enabled device."
"To me, GA is much needed while taking a shower, but once the song is played, me shouting Okay Google falls into deaf ears. Is this the same with Home or mini? Any way to solve this in phone? "
"When I say ""ok Google, play ___ on audible"" it just opens the audible app without opening and playing the specific book I requested.   Also when I ask the assistant to play any book that a film adaption exists for it, it doesn't open audible at all. For example, if I'll say ""ok Google play Dune on audible"" the response will be ""sorry i can't play from audible yet"",y assumption is that it assumes I'm asking for the movie Dune. This whole experience is very annoying."
"This article is an opinion piece. The Verge published a post titled “It’s time to stop trusting Google search already” which follows another article last month attacking Google for surfacing a widely shared 4chan article as a trending story. Healthy skepticism and reasoning should be our default mode. Don’t trust the internet, don’t trust TV, don’t trust your government. Why trust Google in the first place, and if we do, then why isn’t the Verge’s article calling out our education system?   Here’s my issue: if you are going to ask Google search algorithms to take moral positions, what are you really asking for? It’s almost like The Verge expects an algorithm to know actual truth from the slightest falsehood. Even if an algorithm could, should we want that? And even if Google could manually moderate all results, should we want that? I’d say no. THE VERY NOTION THAT A SUPREME SET OF ALGORITHMS OR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE TRUTH ON YOUR BEHALF BEGS FOR TECHNOCRACY. Throughout most of our human history, we have lived under circumstances where government and religion were the ultimate enforcers of truth. Case in point, many of Isaac Newton‘s writings were hidden until 1960 out of fear that this physicist and father of the Enlightenment would have been viewed as a heretic. Also, it’s common knowledge that the famous philosopher Socrates faced a death sentencefor impiety and moral corruption against the gods of Athens when really he was punished for pressing well-known figures in his society to back up their beliefs. Here in the 2017 Americas, silencing people and their speech still occurs when others deem it offensive or hateful. For example, our Canadian neighbors will fine or jail people for speech deemed hateful, and a Richard Dawkins event in California was canceled over his past comments about Islam.  As it turns out, it’s very hard for humans to anticipate the outcome of our actions ahead of time, even when we try to use our best judgment. Moreover, if we are not even that skilled at discerning truth or knowing good from evil as humans, why are we demanding artificial intelligence to have a superior judgment? Artificial Intelligence is, after all, created in our image and trained to carry our biases. Do journalists understand that, barring deplatforming or human moderation, creating scalable algorithms that only show moderated content would require an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)? This is still the stuff of sci-fi. Today’s AI is incredibly dumb, and to achieve AGI, we will likely have to start from scratch. In other words, blogs like The Verge are seemingly asking tech companies for the yet-impossible and, at the same time, lumping culpability for hate speech on these companies rather than the people that create and share it. The Diversity Problem in Artificial General Intelligence What if we did achieve an AGI with the equivalent of human consciousness in a kubernetes container that we could scale on AWS, and it could judge every article and claim on the web for fairness, truth, and hatefulness? Would this solution work? I am skeptical. First, if this were to work, we’d need to solve the diversity problem with AI. What if the AI decides it leans ideologically toward totalitarianism, and we let this AGI curtail our speech? Now, you say, that should never be allowed! While an extreme example, we are now back at suggesting human judgment should influence the AGI. However, which human possesses the ultimate measure of morality and rationality? Which human would be qualified enough? Not a single one!  Fei-Fei Li, Chief AI Scientist at Google, believes that a humane AI should be diverse enough to understand all humans. | Image via TED.com That a genuinely humane AI should understand ALL humans, not just one, is the position ofFei-Fei Li, the brilliant Chief AI Scientist at Google. Suppose we achieve a truly humane AGI. Would it satisfactorily fulfill what The Verge is calling for in its article? Not at all, because we would run into the AGI supremacy problem. Now, we should point out that Robertson’s final conclusion in The Verge doesn’t substantiate her calls for a more appropriate, more highly judgmental algorithm. Instead, she writes, “But when something like search screws up, we can’t just tell Google to offer the right answers. We have to operate on the assumption that it won’t ever have them.” Essentially, that last line is what I’m arguing, but I’m expressing concern over another facet of the argument, where she writes, “We have to hold these systems to a high standard.” We have to hold ourselves to a high standard because the algorithm showing a ‘Top Story’ or ‘Popular on Twitter’ snippet that contains hate speech or mistruths isn’t failing at its purpose. The algorithm successfully shows what’s popular, whether it is fake news or the most widely accepted truth. It’s up to us as humans to know the difference. The Supremacy Problem in Artificial General Intelligence If we were to hold tech firms like Google to create a more humane algorithm that doesn’t “screw up,” I would assert that such an AGI would not only need to be democratized but it would also need to be regularly reset and retrained from scratch, to avoid the formation of a fundamentalist AGI doctrine. If we do not allow for such a process, then we risk what I will call the ‘supremacy problem’ in Artificial General Intelligence. TO AVOID THE SUPREMACY PROBLEM WITH AGI, WE MUST NOT ALLOW IT TO BECOME IMMORTAL FOR AS LONG AS HUMANS ARE MORTAL TOO. If we allow a single mortal entity to create and own an AGI that knows good and evil, and this AGI, being a machine is immortal, then we have a man-created-God scenario. Such Artificial Intelligence would always learn more, become increasingly set in its judgment, and wouldn’t die. In my opinion, this is the stuff of which nightmares (and movies) are made.  Man has never ceased trying to make Gods in his own image. In the end, if we succeed in creating an AGI, we might regret finally succeeding. If we allow a limited number of entities to create and own such AGIs, as, in this analogy, if Google were able to create an algorithm that could judge right from wrong for us, then men would have created a true pantheon of Supreme AGIs. In Canada, a supreme government can already decide on what constitutes tolerable speech, so if they ever equip an AGI to enforce it, the supremacy problem is not that far from reality.   When it comes to the question of mortality, leave it to Elon Musk to already have thought of a way: “an AI-human symbiote.” However, when we die, does our AGI live on? Does it go to AGI heaven, or become reincarnated? Unless the AGI resets or is separated in another realm, his solution does not solve the AGI supremacy problem for everyone, because we’d more likely bisect humanity when a group of people chooses to live a mortal human life instead of living as AI-human symbiotes. In a future dystopian day, the symbiotes may visit a Truman show style zoo of protosymbiotes. (That would be you and me) Deplatforming at Scale is Free Speech Prevention Deplatforming is sometimes justified as there is a time and place for everything. Since we are exploring deplatforming in the context of internet utilities, I am trying to explore the dangers of systematic deplatforming at scale. Since the technology to stop ‘fake news’ (1) is still in the realm of sci-fi, and (2) simultaneously amounts to what is described to be the greatest risk to civilization, we have to resort to old-school methods of speech prevention to achieve what The Verge says Google should. One such old-school method is called deplatforming. Deplatforming means taking away the platform for speech deemed inappropriate. This is a preventive move against free, yet inappropriate, speech. On a micro scale, this is like covering your hands over your ears. On a macro scale, others are putting their hands over your ears. On a vast scale, say, a government or a yet larger technological public utility relied on by billions of people such as Google and Facebook, this amounts to free speech prevention. In an ongoing assault on free speech, China is increasingly engaged in deplatforming its citizens by preventing access to platforms of expression which don’t deplatform, censor, or moderate their users’ speech. Now, companies in the United States like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google are under pressure to do the same. THE NET EFFECT OF MASSIVE DEPLATFORMING IS LIKE AS NEUTERING YOUR CAT AND SAYING YOU SUPPORT HER RIGHT TO BECOME PREGNANT. As a kid who was bullied in school with both hurtful words and physical violence, I know that words can harm more than physical violence. However, I do not believe that systematic and massive deplatforming is the solution. I was not denied a platform to speak up about this violence to my teachers. I was not given a gag order to protect those whose reputation was at stake. Calling for such stifling of speech is creating an easy tool for would-be authoritarians to silence opposition. DEPLATFORMING WAS HOLLYWOOD’S FAVORITE TOOL TO STOP ARTISTS FROM SPEAKING OUT ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE. Deplatforming women, political opposition, ideologies, religious apostates and deviants of every sort–let’s break through the newspeak, and call it for what it can easily become: blanket censorship and a danger to our cherished freedoms. The Human Moderation Option So what can technology companies do? Human moderation, rather than algorithms doing the job, is one potential solution. We established that current AI is too dumb to discern truth from lie, and that future AGI solutions capable of moderation are quite possibly dangerous. Are journalists assuming that a Google employee should moderate and supervise every single search result? I will humor that idea. Google et al. could start charging us money for using search engines and hire operators to connect you with the information you seek. The operators, possessing general intelligence and humane morality, could filter news to their best judgment.  At 3.5 billion searches a day, using human moderators to filter this search volume, Google could end unemployment for a good portion of the world’s population. | Telephone Switchboard | Image via Wikimedia Commons It’s fair to say that would not work either. However, what if we crowdsourced opinions and let the users vote? Now we are talking! Human Moderation Take #2: A Fair Voting System? Many social platforms are based on up-and-downvoting of content. The origins of this brilliant but straightforward system was first popularized with Facebook’s thumbs up. Highly upvoted content is promoted to others, while highly downvoted content falls by the wayside. High-trafficked, controversial content simultaneously has both high upvotes and high downvotes. For this system to work well and be fair, I came up with a few requirements. Some points may be open for debate and be incomplete, but I’m willing to start the conversation. The requirements are: •	(A) Voters are mortal, so that they change their opinions over time so that the status-quo can be challenged. •	(B) Votes are democratized, everyone has an equal vote. •	(C) Votes are anonymous since our behavior, under the expectation of privacy, is closer to our authentic self than if we are at risk of being exposed for our opinions. •	(D) Voters are humane, and votes come from people, not bots. •	(E) Users or platform owners do not manipulate votes. •	(F) Sponsored, boosted, and promoted posts are always identified as such, and sponsors are not allowed to influence the votes. Facebook Facebook is a big offender in my view, already violating rules C, and F, and is increasingly involved in censorship accusations outside of the U.S., and is now trying to manually review content. The American public had a right to know that specific Facebook posts were paid propaganda, but Facebook hasn’t been so transparent about boosted posts.  Moreover, if you secretly liked Hillary while living in Trump land, would you upvote content if your friends could see your likes? Studies have demonstrated that being watched changes you–without you knowing.  (For a Facebook fix, check out this community post.) Google Search Google has been testing user moderation in search engines for many years, but is now under pressure: more voices go up to moderate content, while the company is also increasingly accused of censorship. Google allows users to report inappropriate search predictions, edit the knowledge graph, edit the map data, and so forth.  I wonder what Google is up to at 3am. Given the stake Google has in protecting search results from manipulation and its constant fight against SEOs seeking to manipulate results, imagine how quickly rule E would be violated if Google allowed users to influence search rankings directly? For Google, the news section, trending stories, and social media results are troublesome to deal with. Regular organic search works pretty well, so long they are not being manipulated by humans. What about self-manipulating or moderating of search results? The European Union just fined Google $2.7 billion USD for changing search results, but now Germany is threatening social media companies if they don’t change search results. Damned if you do, well, you know the rest. So what is the difference between Germany and China, other than that those governments want to enforce their idea of good and evil online? To the Credit of Reddit Reddit as a platform implements nearly all of my list of requirements for a fair system of free speech, and so I give it high marks. However, Reddit is also a victim of its popularity and has been akin to a battleground as large organized networks have sought, in the past, to exploit the forum’s fair voting system. This kind of system exploitation has occurred on both on the left and right side of the U.S. political spectrum. For example, in the past year, tens of thousands of pro-Trump users have organized to mass-upvote news favorable to the right. As a result, they were taking over the front page of Reddit. This forced Reddit to take action to curb the power of the pro-Trump users over r/all, because it turned off people who disagreed. Moreover, if the election was any indication, that is roughly just over half of the country. I can imagine this was a challenging situation for Reddit, a for-profit business. In trying to save their company, they were somehow forced to bend rules B and E, and related cases even lead to apologies from Reddit’s CEO. The left has responded in kind, with action dubbed ‘brigading’: the organized mass downvoting of content. At some point, someone went as far as making a list of Reddit users who posted on pro-Trump subreddits. Conspiracy theories ensued when users complained that they were being targeted and deplatformed on various subreddits.   Other tactics were used involving bots, as the screen below illustrates:  Reddit being manipulated by a bot. | Via Imgur This manipulation is clearly against the terms of service, and it remains a constant battle for Reddit. Despite the fair criticism it faced, I have to give Reddit credit. Reddit is a collection of smaller free speech zones and mostly succeeds at achieving a fair voting system so long that people remain in their zones. In some ways, Reddit’s system reflects that of a democracy. Even if Reddit fails at moderating the common areas with the highest standards, at least it does not prohibit users from venturing into subreddits where their views can be challenged. And if that is not good enough, you can always try voat.co or other alt-media sites. In Conclusion Deplatforming on a massive scale is tantamount to censorship, and no current AI is smart enough to know good and evil. If we ever create an AGI smart enough to know good and evil, we have to deal with the supremacy problem, and if we do not, we are back to the equivalent of the human moderation option. From all the current technology available, a fair user voting system is the closest we can get to a balanced system of online expression. However, user voting is tough to get right, and even if you do, it is prone to manipulation and challenging to maintain fairness. Since it’s so hard to foresee all the consequences of our actions reminds me of a magic lamp story. One man wished for so much gold that he would never have to work another day in his life. His wish was fulfilled and he choked on a pile of gold so high it towered above his home. I suppose the best part of being dead is that you don’t have to go to work anymore. Moral of the story?

Hey im trying to turn my lights on and of with assistant. its working fine with phone. but for some reason  nexus gives me only search results 
I woke up after a nap this afternoon to find that I now have the Google Assistant on my Pixel C tablet. Hallelujah! It's about time but I'm wondering if I'm one of the first or one of the last. 
"Anyone figured out how to control Samsung TV with assistant? It took me while just to connect these two, but when I try something like channel up on Sam (which is a nickname) assistant don't work."
"Google Assistant will not give me any kind of weather reading anymore. All it does is either runs a Google search for ""weather forecast"" or it just reads me the Wikipedia definition for ""weather forecast"" and quite frankly, after a week of trying to figure this shit out I'm getting pretty pissed off. Anyone one else have this issue and figure out how to fix it?"
"How to connect the Google Assistant  to the wifi Power Strip Socker? I just bought new wifi Power Strip Socker, I didn't know how to conncet with my Google Assistant."
"Well this seems very obvious to work, currently in your contacts you can save a location of their home address. If you ask : ""Where does [contact] live."" Google gives that location. Therefore I ask - ""Take me there"" . And does not work.  And even better:  If you have a contact that is sharing its live location to you google should ask you if you want to go to their home or if you want to go to their current location.  None of this works on google assistant. And Google already has all of this variables to work. Just needs to make it happen.  I posted this on google forums but only got autoreplies to clear my cache etc etc.. -.-"
"If I say "" Okay google, play white noise"" or "" Ok google play sound of waves"" The assistant responds okay here is white noise etc.. but no sound plays anymore.  I can click on the link 100+ times with no sound coming out.    Any ideas ? "
"I only have one home address programmed in there but when I say ""Let's go home"" it asks me which one with nearby results related to home stuff like Lowe's. So I say ""my home"" and it suddenly knows what home I'm talking about.  Is there a way to fix this?"
"I am wondering if there is a way to receive an alert/notification when an item is added to my Google Shopping List using IFTTT or other 3rd party services? My partner and I share a list, and instead of her messaging me when something is added, it would be great to get an alert either saying a new item has been added, or even WHAT specifically has been added.

I’m going to buy nokia 8 and that would be nice if the phone have Google Assistant. 
What happened that it's android spanish version lack the home control settings when the iOS version not. 
"The Google assistant cannot work on all phones, even phones it says it can. Does any tech savvy person on here know how to Port the Oreo assistant go app to nougat? I know the APK is on apkmiror but incompatible with 7.0 nougat"
On my Google now page and any google search bar i can say ok google and it works totally fine. But when i try to go into settings - ok google detection; all you need to do is say ok google 4 times to turn it on. But i say it a million times and it doesnt register me saying anything. Pls help
So I have Homeseer for my home automation software and it seems that after linking it to google assistant any devices that are added to Homeseer or existing devices are changed (name for example) are not added/changed in google assistant. Anyone else notice this?
"I want to be able to ask the question ""is XXX  metro elevator working today?"" or ""is XXX station open today?"". This information is currently available online, but being able to ask google would really help me in the morning. Am I going to have to wait for the 'navigate to XX page' command to come about? "
"Hello,  I don't know if I'm at the right place to ask this question but I have some small issues when I use Google assistant to play Spotify songs, albums and playlists.  I often get a different result than what is asked for. As an example I asked the Google assistant to play the album Highway To Hell by AC/DC but it started to play a really bad cover version with the same song name made by a band named Death Cab Drivers.  It happens to other song, albums and playlists too if they share the same name. Is there any workaround for this problem?  "
"I can send an SMS text, but I can't figure out how to send an Allo message. "
"I was testing out the new Routines feature in Google Assistant on my Pixel 2 phone and noticed that while I can set up lights to go on or off triggered by certain routines none of my other devices are showing up as controllable. For example I have 2 TVs that are controllable through Assistant, but they don't show up as being able to be controlled through a routine. Anyone else have this issue?"
So I had been using IFTTT for some applets but I decided to get rid of them as they didnt work that well.  I went to IFTTT unlinked my google account.  Deleted my IFTTT account.  Went into my Google Account and removed any access IFTTT had under apps and still whenever I use the phrase setup on IFTTT it responds with the answer phrase.    How long does it take for this to flush through from assistant or is there something else I can do?
"I have an Xperia D6633 phone. When I ask google assistant to start a timer, sometimes halfway through I need to cancel it and attend to something else. Google assistant starts the timer using the default clock app and the timer is found running in that app, but when I cancel the timer in that app, Google Assistant doesn't recognize that it's cancelled and keeps the timer running in some behind-the-scenes place. Suddenly I get a ""time's up"" ringing notification, surprisingly from the default clock app, although that's exactly where I cancelled the timer!  What the hell is going on?  P.S. this exact issue occurs when using Cortana on W10 as well. I start a timer using Cortana's voice commands. Cortana sets up the timer on ""Alarms and Clock"", so I cancel the timer on that app, but Cortana keeps a timer running somewhere else, and rings it when it's done."
"So I have my both my work and home address set in my account. Asking to navigate to work is fine, but for some reason, GA doesn't think I have my home address set, so when I ask to ""Navigate Home"", I get instructions on how to set my home address (""Blue icon...settings...etc"")  Has anyone had this an/or know how to deal with it?"
"The first thing I do when I wake up is grab my phone, go to [NPR's UP First](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first) podcast website because the latest episode shows up there before Stitcher.  Anyway, I listen to the most recent episode on that page by navigating to it and clicking on it.  Is there a way to get GA to respond to ""Start Up First"", and have the assistant play the latest episode for me?  Using shortcuts I made the command phrase ""start up first"" and can get google to open the webpage for me, but getting him/her to perform that final click to start the podcast would be soooo satisfying!"
"Hi there,  Hoping to find some help here as Googling the answer is bringing up nothing.  On my friends phone when he activates Google Assistant and says ""Call Home"" it brings up some TV show called 'A Place to Call Home'. And doesn't actually call the phone number listed as home.  He came to me because I'm supposed to be technically knowledgeable but I'm at a total loss as to how to fix this.  Thanks for any help. "
I'm a full time student and full time employee.      I've missed couple of deadlines because I totally forgot about them.    I was wondering if I can link Google Assistant to Blackboard to remind me about the due date and whatnot.       Is that even possible ?
"I was actually too lazy for a long time to look for a list of all google assistant commands. However, since the MOD's did not pin this, I figured I would share. I'm curious to also see what kind of Raspberry Pi Google Assistant Configs/mods are out there. Anyone know of any?  Link: https://assistant.google.com/explore?hl=en_us"
"I remember the Google Assistant used to notice when I travel to certain locations on a regular basis, for example to my son's school every morning, or to my mom or dad every Friday afternoon, it then would suggest travel times based on those regular trips, I'd get a pop up suggestion on Friday at noon for my trip to my mom/dad and so on. This doesn't happen anymore, for about a year now.. I only get trip times to work, even when it's not relevant like in the evenings :/ Any info about this?"
"I have a transcripton app I use to make voice annotations.  Previously I could make notes with single commands  &gt;Hey Google, Tell XXX [messageToTranscribe]  This no longer works for me (via speech or in the simulator).  I now need to trigger or enable the skill first: &gt; hey Google, Tell XXX.  Then wait for the skill to load and prompt me for my message, which is then transcribed.  Does anyone know if something in the backend has changed?  What do I need to do (or read) in order to support single one-shot commands like I was previously able to make?  "
"So through the numerous pictures of people mounting their Google home minis around their house there have been a few pics of people putting their Google home minis in their bathroom. Understandably those people seem to get flack in the comments about Google home mini probably not doing well in a steamy environment, to which I agree. But since I'm kinda in to shower music or podcasts I was wondering if there were any suggestions for a Google Assistant speaker that could be used in the bathroom or should I just be looking for just a general Bluetooth enabled speaker."
"So I ask Google for a joke every once in awhile, and they're always corny, but whatever. I just randomly asked for a riddle, and there was a whole little adventure series with several riddles. It lasted probably 7-8 minutes with 10 or so riddles. Try it out!"
"No, I am not talking about shortcuts you can make WITH Google Assistant that do specific tasks. I want to create a shortcut that opens Google Assistant itself, so that, for example, I can bring up Google Assistant by shaking my phone instead of press&amp;hold the home button. Is it possible? Then, how?"
Kept happening to me for negative replies. Happened specifically in Google Maps Navigation mode when I ask it random questions while bored driving.
"Half of the time I ask the Google Assistant to ""Ok Google. Play the news"" or ""Ok Google. Play the latest news"", it will reply with, ""OK, playing 'The News' on &lt;myname's&gt; Spotify"" or ""OK, playing 'The Latest News' on &lt;myname's&gt; Spotify"".  Any ideas on how to stop this?  Really annoying to have to turn that all off in the car."
"When I open Google Assistant on my iPhone X and I tell it to “Remind me to go to CVS at 4:00PM”, it ignores the “Remind Me” part and just shows “go to CVS”, triggering a search for CVS instead of creating a reminder. This worked fine until this week. The probem only happens when you talk to it, if I type it, it works fine. I am not sure if they got rid of that option for GA for iOS. Does any one have the same issue?"
"On my Google home mini, the assistant will say the zip code only, not the city name. Anyone else experiencing this?"
"I have a problem. I never signed up for google assistant BUT sometimes when I saw ""Okay Google"" or even ""Google Assistant""  it pops up and says it's listening. I went to turn it off but it says I haven't even agreed to use it. I don't want this thing listening to me. How do I turn it off?"
"While many of us still prefer to type our queries in the search bar to look for anything online, voice search is fast becoming a new trend driving changes in search engine algorithms. Which means what merely started as playing around with Cortana, Siri and later, Alexa is actually turning into a defining trend that will not just change the way searches are made but also bring along the need to modify your SEO and digital marketing strategies. However, before we delve into the details of how this trend is about to change Google for good, let’s find out…    **Is Voice Search Really Taking a Toll?**  As per the statistics collected by Search Engine Watch, voice search queries on Google have increased by over 35x, since 2008. At least one in every 5 searches made through an Android app was voice-based, in the US in 2016. Cortana has reached its record user-base of over 133 million active monthly users and 19% of all Siri users are using the virtual assistant on a daily basis. Around 25 million voice-controlled devices were reportedly sold last year, all around the world and it is predicted that voice recognition technology will become $600 billion industry by the end of 2019.  As much as 50% of all searches made on Google and other engines will be voice-based. While this might sound a bit exaggerated as of now, certain actions by Google indicate that this isn’t a far-fetched dream.   **How’s Google Keeping up With The Trend?**  The release of 1st generation Echo and Alexa by Amazon back in November 2014 was a breakthrough in voice recognition technology and effectively paved the way for it to become a mainstream practice among masses. In just a little over a year’s time, Amazon’s Echo and Alexa had become their most sought-after devices, especially during the holiday season in 2016.  Keeping with the tides of the trend, Google put forth Google Home in the market in 2017 — a smart speaker device, integrated with voice recognition technology and assisted by Google Assistant. It wasn’t long before Google announced the integration of Google Assistant in TV device — to make them smarter than ever. These developments in voice recognition technology within just a few years is a sure-tell sign that Google has identified voice as its core driving factor and is revamping all its algorithms and techniques to be able to cater to queries pouring in through speech.  This leads us to the conclusion…    **It’s Time to Revamp your Digital Marketing and SEO Game**  Voice search will change the way people search — and no, it’s not just about the switch from text to speech.

I'm currently using assistant on my android phone. I have set my home &amp; work locations as well as news sources but for some reasons it stops after telling me the weather. Is anyone else experiencing this issue? Not sure if this only works if you have a home or home mini.
"Hey everyone, I'm wondering if anyone can give me a straight answer on how to change the default apps for google assistant. Recently, when I say ""Take a note"" Google assistant started using OneNote instead of Wunderlist without me ever intentionally changing it. When it was Google Now there was a clear menu to go to, but I've searched everywhere and can't find an answer now that it's Google Assistant. I have a Pixel and there are no app defaults set for either Wunderlist or OneNote. I want to change the default to Wunderlist. Any thoughts?  Thanks!"
[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ahHziba.png)  I got a new ROM and can't get the assistant working :/ any suggestion?
"I'm trying to make a shortcut so that I can say ""no, don't"" and the assistant play a clip on YouTube from bill Wurtz where he sings ""how bout I do, anyway?"" And it's completely ruined when the assistant replies ""Ok, playing how about I do anyway video on YouTube""   Any work around for this? And yes I know this is a stupid waste of time but it's fun. I've already used shortcuts to have Google assistant argue with me but it's side of the argument is the Navy seals copypasta."
This makes using Google assistant .. awkward when responding to texts from the boss.   How do I avoid a rodgering?
"Hi! I'm trying to add a Onkyo Tx-nr656 which has chromecast built in to Google assistant on my phone. Casting manually from spotify and play music works great, but I also want Google assistant to be able to start casting. When i try to add the device under TVs and speakers in the assistant settings I get ""Error occured during linking. Please try again"".  I have factory reset the receiver, updated firmware and tried both wireless and wired connections without success.. Any tips?  I'm running android 7.0 on a Xiaomi redmi note 4. I live in sweden, but all locale settings are set to US. "
"Hi there, is there a way to control your computer via Google Assistant.

At the top of my galaxy s7 i have an icon to bring up voice google command.  well all of a sudden it randomly changes now it brings up google assistant from the bottom and the layout and design is different than the screen that displaye before.  Does anyone know what I'm talking about?   this is what the old screen looked like: http://s3.amazonaws.com/digitaltrends-uploads-prod/2017/02/ok-google-android-smartphone.jpg  this is what the new screen looks like: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vci6FGp_0XxJb-EmFi9h97UumlQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x800/filters:focal(857x517:1183x843)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57002293/akrales_170517_1694_0099.0.0.jpg   how do i get the old google voice command feature back?
"Aim: We have an Android-App that contains a form that when clicked on the conform button sends its values as a HTTP-Request to our Webserver. We now want to do the same but without the form and just using Google Assistant. We want so say for example ""new Person Alice, female 20 years old"" and then send the HTTP-request out with the values chosen.  Is this possible?"
Is there a way to turn off specific areas of interest in Google Assistant? For some reason it thinks I want to be notified instantly about each and every story about the Winter Olympics - I do not.  I certainly never told it the Olympics was an area of interest.  I'd rather not turn off the notifications entirely because they do occasionally tell me something of interest. 
"If I use Assistant to set a location-based reminder to remind me of something when I get ""home"", it works, every time. (So notifications are obviously switched on)  If I set a location-based reminder for my local super market, my gym, or any one of many other places I've tried, the reminder never gets triggered.  The only other place that has ever worked was just the name of my home town, rather than ""home"", but any other specific places don't work.  But if I look in my timeline in the Maps app, it has registered me being in all of the places that I set the reminders for.  So why are the reminders not going off for all these places? Help!!  As a test, I tried using Cortana to set location based reminders for my gym, my supermarket etc, and they all trigger within a minute of me arriving, every time.  My phone is a Galaxy S7."
"I want an app that will allow me to place shortcuts on ny phone that I can press that would do the same as talking to Google assistant. Example, set up a shortcut that ""turns on lights in the living room and plays npr on the good speakers""  Is there anything like this?"
"Considering how important China is as a market, I'm surprised it isn't already available in Mandarin."
"Right now if one of my kids turns the lights blue or some other color, the only way to reset it, that I know of, is to flip off and on the hard switch.  Is there a voice command to turn the light back to its normal color (2700k lightbulb color)?  The lights are connected through a smart things hub."
"Does anybody else have an issue where Google will playback the news and podcasts you've selected with varying levels of volume?  Is there a way to standardize the volume setting somehow?   It's particularly annoying when I'm getting ready (in the morning!) and Google starts playing the news so low I can't hear it, then I volume up and the next news source is so loud it wakes up my neighbors before I can yell at Google to volume down. "
"So I'm subscribed to daily jokes and facts and whatever - when I get the notification, it just shows me the text rather than reading it to me! But if I ask it for another one, it'll read to me no problem.   Also after it reads me my daily briefing, it used to say ""here's the latest news"" and now it doesn't, it just starts playing the news.   Any ideas?"
"On a pixel 2 Xl. Has anyone ever had issues where assistant couldn't recognize a song even though the same song was currently recognized on the ""now playing"" notification?"
"Just kind of ranting here that if, in the settings, under devices, in 'Phone', if I set ""Use Screen Context"" to 'on', Assistant forgets some triggers that IMO it shouldn't. For example, if I say ""Hey Google, Good morning"" on my home screen or almost any other screen, I get my daily briefing. If I run it while Google Maps is on screen, it just says ""Good morning, here are some things you can say"" and doesn't play the briefing at all.  What's the explicit trigger for the daily briefing? ""Tell me about my day""? ""Play my daily briefing""? I'll try that when I get in the car this afternoon with Maps on the screen."
I just discovered I can activate GA from my Bluetooth headphones by pressing and holding the play button on the headphones. Using Bose SoundLink On-Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones and Pixel 2 Phone.
"Phone: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (SM-G935W8) running Android 7.0.  When I have Assistant open (having held down the home key) and then tap the microphone icon to activate listening for my command, my phone emits a loud DTMF tone (I think it's the '5' tone to be precise) through the connected Bluetooth device (usually my car stereo) for about 10-15 seconds.  I just tried to do this right now to make sure I was getting the steps right, but right now I'm not connected to any BT devices, and I just got the normal Google chime. So I'm thinking it might happen only when connected to a Bluetooth audio device.  Any idea why this happens?"
"Any time I say ""ok Google, remind me at x time to do y,"" she asks if I want to save this. Which is normal. I tell her yes. Her response?  ""I hear ya"" and she doesn't save the fucking reminder. Has anyone else experienced this? I also have 3 Google Homes, but they don't save on there either, and it also happens when I long press the home button."
I was just thinking how nice it would be if the Assistant app on the iphone would keep the phone awake while the app is running (like many cooking apps do). That way any plugged in ios device could function as another Google Home. Here's to hoping Google makes it happen.
"Yes, hello,  Old guy here. I've setup the Google assistant speaker up, and placed the original Chromecast device into the HDMI port. Turned CEC+ on w/ my Samsung Smart 4k television.  It worked great for about 2 weeks.  But recently whenever I ""Hey Google, turn on living room tv""  Nothing happens.   I googled, found the generic troubleshoot link that pops up from Google about this. It must be a known issue if they already have a help tag for this issue.  Anyways I followed these instructions and it worked for about a day....   Now, it's doing it again... What on earth has overtaken this thing   The first model Chromecast is plugged into the wall.  The Samsung smart tv supports cec+ (The Samsung bluray player has no issue turning the tv on &amp; off)  And the lights come on whenever I speak to the airfreshener (it really does look like aire freshener) the log on Google shows that it heard me properly, has the command recorded verbatim.  Can anybody help this oldman out?  I really am at wits end.  -thanks "
"I would love to have Google Assistant come over to the Apple Watch, but I haven’t been able to find any details on it.  Wanted to see if anyone here had heard anything by chance?  Obviously no way Apple would let it over take Siri as far as pushing a hardware button to access as the default digital assistant (I wish), but even having the ability to just open the app from the watch would be great..."
"I've never tried to use (or do I want to use) the google assistant, but when I go for a run with headphones in and listening to music, the google assistant comes up for no reason. About 10-15 minutes in (on most runs, it occasionally doesn't do it), the google assistant comes up and starts saying ""when it's safe"" not sure what the rest is because most of the time it starts going crazy here. Usually it says this again and then changes my songs rapidly playing each song for a max of 1 second and then changing to the next song. It will occasionally say the ""when it's safe"" thing again to get me to use the google assistant. By this time I'm fed up and turn off my headphones.  How do I turn this off or get it to stop doing it? It's really annoying because I have my phone in my waist hydration belt, so it's tough to access the phone while running without slowing down and using unnecessary energy to pull it out and fiddle with it. And then it continues to act up after the fact anyways, so it's useless."
"Hi,  Google Assistant is officially was released in Spanish some time ago, but I am having a big problem with my Xiaomi MI6 running xiaomi.eu rom. I tried both stable and weekly roms.  If I set my phone language to SPANISH then Google Assistant doesn't work. Google Now is launched instead and I can see the message ""El Asistente de Google aun no admite el español(España)"" (Google Assistant still not support Spanish (Spain))   I have posted this same problem on xiamomi.eu forums and some people have replied they don't have this problem with the same phone and rom version, so I guess isn't a rom problem....  does anyone had a similar problem with Assistant in Spanish? I would appreciate any idea or suggestion.   Have a nice day."

"Hey Everyone,  New to both Google Home and IFTTT. Downloaded the app and started looking through the applets available. Dipped my toe in the water with ""Send a text message to someone with your Android and Google Home"". Went through the steps, set it up to text my wife.  Now...if I want to be able to use that same ""recipe"" for other contacts, how do I do that? I don't see any obvious options for duplication. Unless I'm just missing it."
"I've searched around a good but, and I can't find anything that can send a command to Google Assistant on a trigger or timer (like IFTTT, etc.)"
"Anytime Google Assistant gives me the weather for Watertown, Wisconsin it will include the state name however, it pronounces it as ""why"" as if it was reading the 2 letter state abbreviation instead of the full state name (or even omitting it).   For example, asking the current temperature gives the response, ""The current temperature in Watertown, Why right now is 36 degrees.""  This becomes even more obvious when you ask if it will snow tomorrow.  It responds with, ""No, snow is not expected tomorrow in Watertown, Why.""   Is there any way to change this behavior or will I have to live with the fact the google assistant will always seem to be asking rhetorical questions? "

"Got a home mini for Christmas. Very exciting. Very worrying. #themachinesarerising  One recent issue involves my other rising rebel group: my kids. I'm getting frequent Hey, Google fights. I ask my Google to play Seven Swans on the Living Room Home Mini. My 7 year old crinkles her face, says ""this is boring"" then says ""Hey, Google, play Afro Circus,"" and the fickle tart listens to my 7 year old. Then my 9 year old jumps in: ""Ok, Google, play..."" This starts a shouting match of ""Hey, Googles"" with mega annoying 1 second sound samples and robot chirps.  Thus, is there anyway for me to restrict voice recognition to only myself, or best case, to only those over 12?  Please help. My robot, dangit."
Am I the only one who thinks that the Google assistant should have the volume separate from the media volume? Is annoying that every time I say ok Google and ask for something I can't hear it because I have the volume down. It is more than obvious that if I'm saying ok Google means that I'm far from the device and I need to be loud to hear it. I wrote Google about it but nothing changes.

"As  somebody who uses the qc35 ii  all day long, it talks too much. Especially if you use it for a lot of home automation. If Google's going to have a direct communication with your hearing they should give you finer audio controls.

I don't need you to keep beeping after you read me a text message waiting for me to respond. If I tell it to turn off lights I don't want it to go and tell me what it just did I can see it.

"I recently got my phone swapped out by Google, the 1st issue has always been there, the 2nd one seems to be a new issue.  1) We are about to be getting Google Home so I've been doing research and thought I'd try some commands on my Google Assistant, this first one simply doesn't work. When I say ""play my xxxx playlist"" or ""shuffle xxxx"" all it does is play ""xxxx radio"" in Play Music. I have a family subscription (mine's the main account) but I cannot for the life of me get it to play any of my playlists using my voice. What am I doing wrong?  2) This one is more frustrating, we've recently bought smart plugs and bulbs and we're using voice commands to change them, turn on/off etc. When I hold down the home button, Assistant pops up, the prompts with suggestions (Play music, what's on my calendar?"" etc) pop up, the microphone icon is 4 dots like it's listening, but the dots never change from dots, it simply doesn't hear me, I have to press home to come out of it and then go straight back in and it works. It does this every single time, without fail. Any idea what I can do? I've wiped the phone a week ago, but it's still doing it!   EDIT: After some messing trying to record a video of this happening I've noticed it's only an issue of it not hearing me when I unlock my phone (fingerprint) and got straight into the assistant. If I unlock and leave it a few seconds then it works OK, but in that time I could have got up and manually changed what I'm trying to do!"

It was offline for a couple of months while we were selling the old house and this morning voice control worked fine to change the temperature.  I noticed, however, that it said I needed to Unlink and re-link it to update. So I unlinked it but now when I try to re-link it appears to work correctly until it gets to the ""Add to a room"" screen.  That screen pops up for about a second then goes away and I get a message saying it successfully linked the Nest account but my Thermostat doesn't show up under my devices.  I've tried this numerous times and tried removing Google Assistant from the Works with Nest connections in my Nest account.  I've restarted the thermostat and my phone and keep having this same issue.  I've also tried deleting all of my Rooms and even adding anew room but still get the same result.  I can control my thermostat from the Nest site, from the Nest app on my phone and from our Echo Dot so I know the thermostat and my Nest account are all working as expected but I'd really like to get this working in Assistant again, especially considering I only removed it because Assistant told me I needed to."
"Is there any way to tie assistant into some sort of TV listing service and be able to ask what time a certain program is playing, what's on primetime tv tonight, etc?  I know in this world of DVRs that this may be antiquated, but we still watch a fair amount of live tv.  Thanks"
"""Ok Google, turn all the lights on"" doesn't work all the time. Do I have other options? What can I say?"
"My google assistant always recognizes ok google command but only answers in voice to some questions but not others. If asked to ""do not disturb until 7 o'clock"" it will voice ""change to alarms only until 6.59"" but if asked ""will it rain tomorrow?"" It will just print the response.  At a loss. Any ideas?"
"Hi, In my car today I asked Google Assistant on my phone to set the nest temp to 22C. It responded with ""That temperature is outside the locked range on the Nest"". When I got home I asked my Google home the same question and it immediately set the temp of my nest. I then again asked Google Assistant on my phone and now it worked. Is there a requirement of being on the same wifi? I used to be able to do this while driving when I didn't have the Google Home yet. Does it make a difference?"
"When it prompts me to set up personal results by recognizing my voice, my phone just gets stuck on the ""please wait"" screen endlessly. What's causing this issue?"
"Ok, hoping someone can explain this for me. I have Assistant on my phone (Nexus 6). I installed IFTTT on it and set it up to talk to my Harmony Hub to turn my TV and components on/off, etc. All good, and my phrases that I setup in IFTTT work. I also have an Nvidia Shield TV which recently got Assistant.   What is curious to me is that when I'm in the living room and say, ""OK Google, Turn on the TV"" (or Shield, or Radio, or Game Console), it is clearly the Shield responding and kicking off the action. I can see it reacting to my voice (LED blinks) and my Nexus 6 is a tad slow to respond to ""OK Google"". So how does the assistant on the Shield know about the custom actions I setup on IFTTT on my phone? IFTTT is not installed on the Shield. And I know it definitely is using Harmony Hub because I see it respond and it has to switch HDMI ports on the receiver depending on what action I want.  I'm not complaining about it, but was pleasantly surprised. "
Is there any way I can just manually put in my interests? I love Google Assistant but when I search for one thing once it automatically pulls up news about whatever I searched for. Does anyone else experience this?

When I open the assistant I don't see the blue home button on the top right and the settings on Google now don't show me a ""my day"" option. Is it because of my phone? I'm on a Galaxy S6 edge running the newly released pixel launcher. Thanks for the help!"

"On the [official support page](https://support.google.com/googlehome/answer/7214982?hl=en) from Google there are commands for playing Netflix directly on the Chromecast. However, the commands are for the Google Home device and not for the assistant.  I wonder if there is a way to make it work for smartphones since ""Ok Google, play Narcos on Netflix"" opens the series on the Netflix app. However, the command in the title only opens the google search."
"Hello guys, here is my problem.  I have a Galaxy S5 (I'll change soon but the problem is the same).

With the release of assistant in French (France) I can't help but wonder how come Google assistant was never released in French Canadian even though it is available on Google home and Android wear?!
"Hi,   I believe all the features of a Google Assistant are just void if your phone locks after 30 seconds of inactivity. And of course this is necessary for security.  There is a feature to say ""Ok Google"" with a voice model so that it unlocks the phone, but my girlfriend managed to unlock it on top of MY male voice model...   My question is: why can't you just add a feature so that you can say ""Ok Google"" when the phone is locked, and then it replies ""Please say your PIN"", and here you can register either a sentence or just numbers, like ""one, two, three, four"", and THEN the phone unlocks when it recognizes the right words.  There are many situations where I'd like to use Google Assistant and when I'm alone or with people of trust, like in my car, but I obviously can't reach to unlock the phone with my fingers. In these cases I wouldn't mind actually ""SAYING"" the PIN instead of using the weakly protected voice model.  "

"Hey guys! So, I've got a Philips Hue setup connected to my Google Assistant so I can use voice control on it. I'm having an odd issue though where if I say ""Ok Google, TV Room lights 50 percent"" it thinks I said ""okay TV Room lights 50 percent"" and gives me search results instead of controlling my lights. If I tap the microphone after that and just say ""TV Room lights 50 percent"" it works as expected. I'm guessing Assistant is somehow picking up that ""okay"" and thinking it means I want it to search for something. Do you guys have any tips for making it more reliable from the ""Okay Google"" trigger instead of tapping the microphone icon? Thanks!"
"I had it changed once but haven't used it in awhile. I thought I followed all the directions. I don't know where I found it, but I found the list of languages that say pick 5. (It's in the google app setting under voice). So I picked different English languages (Australia, New Zealand, U.K., etc.). Now I can't figure out how to use one for the assistant's voice. No joy.  I tried everything I found online. Went into a Google Play, to Settings, Phone, Languages, it sends me right back to the Android Settings where I can choose English, Spanish or Chinese. Still can't get my Aussie accent. No joy.  So I went to Google app, clicked on settings again, go to Voice, languages, and tried setting the Aussie language as the only one. No joy.  I specifically did not pick English (US) yet all responses come with that darn bland US accent. I also remember I used to be able to pick between several different male and female voices. When did that change?   Can anybody help me... find somebody to love. Okay, not to love, but to fix this!  Added bonus, Ok Google keeps turning off by itself. No rhyme or reason. Huh? Yeah, I got issues. :/ "
Every time I use the OK Google hot word on my Nexus my Google Home reads me the content of my list and it doesn't show up on my phone.

I’m using the Google Assistant on my iPhone SE and saying “OK Google” doesn’t elicit an audible response (no “beep”). Is this a glitch with the software? Does the issue happen with Android phones also?
Actually you'll be able to add reminders once you turn on google now
"So my experience with Assistant has been extremely inconsistent. It either doesn't function the way it should, or behaves differently every time I try to use it.  It will never unlock my phone upon a voice command from me whether the screen is on or off. I have it set to unlock on command and also to accept voice when the screen is off. Neither work. Once I unlock my phone manually, it will work and as long as the screen is on, it will continue to work. Once the screen is off, it ceases to function again.  I have it set to unlock when it connects to my car stereo. This also does not work half the time. However, this is probably an issue outside of Assistant. Once I unlock the phone manually, the stereo will at least keep it unlocked after that, but I still have to turn the screen on for it to accept commands. I keep the phone in a holster clipped to my seat belt and slightly slid out of the holster so that the light sensor will allow the screen to turn on when I hit the button, after which I can talk to it. It's an LG G4, so the unlock button is on the back and easier to reach for than any button on the car's dashboard. This is, however, far what I would call a true hands-free setup and I'm sure I would probably get pulled over if a cop saw me just briefly touching a button on my phone like this.  Third, and probably the most irritating: Sometimes, if I had music playing and decide I want to un-pause it, saying ""Resume Music,"" ""Resume Google Music,"" ""Un-Pause Music"" or pretty much any variation of that will cause Assistant to do a search for that term rather than recognize that I want it to actually resume what I had playing.  Ok, I've ranted enough. This is just me venting since these issues seem like some of those crazy unique issues that no one else will have experienced and have no solutions for. I don't expect anything to come of it. However, if anyone does by chance have any ideas, I'm open ears."
"I've connected an old phone to a bluetooth speaker to create my own faux Google Home.  Works well, with one glaring problem, it only is recognizing my voice saying ""Okay Google.""

Whenever I long press my physical home button my phone goes to sleep mode. Can I use Xposed Edge or something to remap this to launch Google Assistant instead?
Watching the I/O - one of the most persistent demos is around the use of voice to manage your schedule - either via user interaction or increasingly it being proactive.   However it appears to me there is an issue that google does not want to discuss but seems to growing - spam. The google calendar is vulnerable to spam and assistant pulls that spam in.  Are we about to enter a cat and mouse era with voice spam similar to what we have seen in email ?

"*[TL;DR Google Assistant' contextual learning is extremely limited and cannot even set a reminder for a sport related event which it can identify]*     ↓↓_______FULL RANT_______↓↓   Ok this is driving me nuts. But hear me out.   As far as I know Google Assistant(GA) is better than Siri or any other voice assistant (dunno about bixby)  because GA is an ai.   She has something called **contextual learning ability**. She is **supposed** to know **what** we are talking about based on the **context**, *which is mostly set by previous question*.  This was demonstrated in the following manner.  You- Ok Google.  Who is the lead actor of Scarface?  GA - Alpacino....  You- When is **his** birthday?  GA - tells you Alpacino's bday.   Notice how I said **HIS** and didn't mention **who**  GA knew the context here.  Now when I try this with my GA (on my phone)  it works most of the time. I have even used it to show an apple user how GA is superior to Siri. Thankfully I used the same example as demo.   Ask about a lead in a movie.  Then ask '**his**' birthday. Wallah.   Siri goes something about doing g a web search for birthday   GA- Gives the l bday of the star in context.  Thankfully I didn't try the following  it would have been embarrassing.  ...  I used the same logic and asked  When is the next Manchester united  game?'  GA - Tells me date and the opponent and the location.  Then when I say  'Set a reminder for **it**'  GA - *Sure, WHEN do you want the reminder?*  Uhh!!? what happened to context?  Nevermind,  Let's try   'Set a REMINDER for the next Manchester United game'  GA - Okay, setting reminder, **The next Manchester United game**. What time do you want it?   I have tried this with other sports also...same results!!  How come GA doesn't get the context here?  or   Even when I mention the Context, GA doesn't understand what I'm talking about?  When I ask   'Who are  Manchester United?'  Big G knows what I'm talking about.  When I say **REMINDER** even then GA knows what's up.   So what is going on?   Am I saying the phrase wrong?  ?? So I tried asker her what's wrong?  I asked her   'What's wrong Google?'  And just like a typical girlfriend she goes   ""**OH Nothing**.""   I am at my wit's end   Is the contextual learning limited only to movies n celebrities?    "

"While I haven't had a chance to use Google Assistant in person, it seems that when the assistant is activated it has a very unattractive, linear animation. Google usually has very slick and fluid animations but when the assistant is activated, it doesn't seem to be as nice as the rest of the animations. Anyone else agree or know why they choose to go with this animation? "
The assistant in Allo won't. It lets me select the account shut keep saying no account is selected. Just wondered if the full Pixel version does?   Getting sick of Google leaving us apps users out! 
"Okay, let's put this in perspective. I'm a total Google fanboy and was ecstatic about Assistant. The other day, it was discovered that a simple build.prop tweak could bring it to any N device.  So I hopped on that. My friends witnessed as I squealed in delight when pressing and holding the Home key brought up those four dots.  Now, I played with it for a few minutes. It's more responsive than Now, so kudos for that. It does everything it did in the Allo preview.  But that's where the good things end, for now. Right now, OK Google is broken. When you say the keywords, it'll pop up with the ""Let Assistant get to know your voice"" pop-up appears. I tried rectifying this through the Voice page, but it crashes the Google App. This won't be an issue on Pixel, but it is here.  Now, Pixel. Let's talk about that. In Assistant's settings it says specifically ""Settings for this Pixel phone"". This is not a good sign for Assistant coming to other devices, but it might just be because of the build.prop data.  The final nail in the coffin was this: On Tap sucks. It doesn't detect things as well as the old build, and you can't select text manually. I often copy text using On Tap from apps (Google+, Facebook, Twitter) that don't allow native copying.  So if you're bummed you don't have Assistant, don't fret — you're better off without it.  I've kept the modified build.prop, so maybe I'll keep checking up on Assistant and revising my opinion"
Will google assistant(Like the one showed today in Pixel phones) be included in the Android 7.1 update for Google Nexus 5X and 6P?
"Recently, Google launched a product Google Assistant that has the caliber of taking over the Tech market. Google has planned to go face to face with Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. Due to the fear of losing the market of Artificial Intelligence(AI), Google has come up with an innovative and a user friendly product.  Known as Google Assistant, it can be taken as an upgraded version of Google Now. Google Now can do many things for you like Searching and the most important feature being the Google Now cards that shows you useful information about almost everything you need. In the annual Google I/O developer Conference, back in May 2016 Google talked about Google Assistant. The main motive of this new virtual assistant was seen as an improvement in the Google Now’s two way conversation experience. If you have any doubts, about any of the things we have talked about till now, Don’t worry we have discussed everything in very detail below.  What is Google Assistant? Google Assistant is a new virtual assistant that Google sees as an improvised version of its current Google Now assistant. It can be seen as and upgraded or extended version of the Google Now. The very first assistant that got popular in the market was Apple’s Siri. Since then Google had been working upon such projects. The CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai said,” We at Google want people to experience two-way conversation with the virtual assistant “. Keeping this in mind Google followed the path of Apple’s Siri.  What does Siri do? Siri can just be understood like your Assistant that can do almost everything you want. From Weather reports to setting alarms to getting the Live scores or the Trending News. Siri can do it all for you on your command. To keep up with the Siri which is only available for iOS, Google introduced Google Now for Android. The fact that it is not as personal and handy as Siri, but it has a feature of Google Now cards which can fetch the lastest information that you need, from Google. The most significant feature was scanning your mail list track your orders, important dates and many other things.  Just like Siri for iOS and Google Now for Android, there is Alexa from Amazon. Alexa, is not just limited to iOS or Android, which makes it special. It can be found in company’s connected Bluetooth Speaker known as Amazon Echo. Since, its launch in the year 2014, Amazon Echo, lets you do unlimited things like ordering a pizza, paying the bills, booking the Uber and keeping a check on connected  devices.  Alexa gained so much popularity in a small time that it needed to launch two different versions of Amazon Echo. Inspired by this, Google too launched a product called Google Home at Annual Google I/O Developer Conference. It is quite similar to Amazon Echo but has an amazing advantage that, it is powered by Google Assistant.  In the conference, Google explained the Assistant as :  The assistant is conversational – an ongoing two-way dialogue between you and Google that understands your world and helps you get things done. It makes it easy to buy movie tickets while on the go, to find that perfect restaurant for your family to grab a quick bite before the movie starts, and then help you navigate to the theater.    What is Artificial Intelligence? Artificial Intelligence is the science of making the computers to the work that if done by humans require intelligence and thinking. AI definitely has achieved success in the recent past, but it is limited to some niches and domains only. Since, the evolution of the AI, 50 years back, not much of advancement has come to AI. A very slow growth rate of Ai have been seen as achieving human-level intelligence is not an easy task at all.  Benefits of Artificial Intelligence The Artificial Intelligence is very accurate and precise. The chances of error are almost NIL. Intelligent machines can replace human beings in many areas of work. Robots with the help of AI can do certain difficult tasks which have long been carried out by humans. It is possible because of the intelligence programmed the  machines that they can hold greater responsibilities and can be programmed to manage themselves. Many organisations use digital assistants that interact with the user for increasing and enhancing the customer support. When we play a computer game, we are in fact interacting with artificial intelligence. In a game where the computer plays as our opponent, it is with the help of AI that the machine plans the game moves in response to ours. Thus, gaming is among the most common examples of the advantages of artificial intelligence. The greatest advantage of artificial intelligence is that machines do not require sleep or breaks, and are able to function without stopping. They can continuously perform the same task without getting bored or tired. When employed to carry out dangerous tasks, the risk to human health and safety is reduced. How does Google Assistant Work? The Google Assistant is an Artificial Intelligence(AI) and works in the way that, if we ask a question, it again throws follow up questions upon us. When we answer these questions, it keeps a record of the whole conversation. At the end, when it has done its processing determining the whole situation it displays the best answers to us. Not much of its working and features are known till present, but it is known for sure that it is coming on two of its products called Google Allo and Google Home.     Google Allo Google Allo  Allo is a new messaging app launched by Google for iOS and Android platform. Calling it just a messaging app would be wrong, because it has so many features that it is going to give the Messaging giants a tough competition.  It was introduced in Google I/O conference 2016. Not only it provides you with the messaging feature, it makes your chats very attractive and interactive. The idea is same as Whatsapp i.e. using the Phone number for starting but if you already have a Google account added to your Android it automatically adds it to your profile. Fllowing the footmarks of other messengers it also features those emojis and speakers to make chats fun.  Apart from all of these, Google Assistant still remains the hottest feature. As we have seen in Facebook Messenger that the virtual assistants and bots are used, Google also did the same thing, combining these assistants and bots into a single product.  You can ask questions in Allo by simply typing “@google” followed by the question. It can also be done by dictating the question through Voice mode. The Google Assistant will ask more follow up questions and once fully aware of the context it responds back with the best answers.  Let’s have some example to learn more about Google Assistant. In case you go to a new place or a city, you need to find the best hotel in the area, best food points and the map of the whole city. In that case, Google Assistant will help you with all its potential. If in case you are bored and too tired to do something, simply ask the Google Assistant about the jokes, memes and funny videos . It will search the best available on the Google.  Just like Facebook Messenger, it also features in chat gaming. Just type “@google let’s play a game” and you will get the option to play emoji games. Allo is a full-of-fun app with Google Assistant which makes the experience even better. Along with it, Allo even has an Incognito Mode so as to make your chats private. The chats can also be made to self-destruct after a specific time.Icoginito Feature in Google Allo      Google Home Google Home  Google Home just like Amazon Echo is a WiFi speaker which acts as an assistant for the whole family by being a smarthome control centre. Apart from being just an entertainment device for the whole house it also helps us manage everyday tasks and ask questions to Google. All of this is possible with the help of Google Assistant.  Google assistant uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning to determine the situations of the questions. For example, if we type ” Let’s watch The Legend of Tarzan”, it will show the results of the ticket booking websites. If we ask “Is The Legend of Tarzan good”?, it will show you the reviews of the movie, trailer and the ratings by the various websites.Also, it has the capability of compiling all your questions together and showing the most favorable result.  It can also do other basic things like maintaining your daily schedule, commute your working time and many other fascinating things, all with the help of Google Assistant.     Integration with other companies Google Home can give you the functionality to be the control center of your home using the Google Assistant. It will give us various benefits like setting up alarms, maintaining a to-do list and even connecting your smarthome and leading global network systems. It means you might be able to control your fans, lights, doors etc.  In the near future, Google is even planning to work with developers for even more ease of work. For example, booking a car for your tour, sending cards and flowers to your beloved ones, or ordering dinner online. You might be thinking what’s the benefit in that? when we are still doing these things online. The answer is, All of these will be done with just the help of your voice. You don’t need to click excessively or pay every time.  Alexa is already integrated with some big third party applications and softwares like Spotify, IFTT, Uber, Dominoes, Phillips, Belkin and many more. Seeing this now, Apple also announced that it will also be releasing Siri speaker which will be open to third party developers and the Google Assistant is also working on Third party integration.     When can you use Google Assistant? Google Assistant can easily be accessed and enjoyed through the Google Allo app which is already available on the playstore. But, Google has assured that it will available throughout the Google ecosystem by 4 October along with some other major product launch. The long awaited Pixel phones, and Google Home router will finally be launched at the event.  Google Assistant as it sounds, is very much advanced form of Google Now, so Google might bring an end to the Google Now. But, till now no official reports have been made for such a news.
