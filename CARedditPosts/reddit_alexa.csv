"Hi all,  I'm setting up an alexa light switch for the parents and one wants to use their voice and the other does not. They obviously cant physically turn the light off or the voice toggle on the switch won't light the light, but I can't find a physical button (other than the button on the switch itself) I can use that just says ""When I press this toggle that."" Any help?"
"Concept similar to noise cancelling headphones, but with the regular Alexa family of speakers. Basically set up when you want to sleep and the Alexa speakers invert the background noise from their microphones so that you can sleep in silence.  I work night shifts, so muting the traffic and neighbours going about their day would be a godsend!  Just thought I’d see what people here thought of the concept?"
Ok so to start out I set many alarms throughout the morning trying to slowly wake myself up. I enjoy alexas feature that allows the alarm to slowly rise in volume but I have to make sure to keep my alarm loud enough for me to actually wake up. Here’s the problem: once when I was setting an alarm Alexa asked me if I want to turn on a certain setting and I said yes. Basically every time I ask her to stop the alarm what can only be described as an orchestra of animal cheers blast like a foghorn at full volume. I don’t know what the setting is called and their is no info online so I’m turning to the subreddit!
"First time using the lights. I connected them through the hue bt app, and through my google home app (I have both alexa and google). Weirdly, though, Alexa can't seem to be able to find the lights at all.   I have an echo right next to both bulbs.  What could be the issue?"
"""Alexa DO NOT connect to the speaker"" ""Searching"" ""Alexa disconnect from the speaker"" (Throught the speaker) ""hmmm, there's no bluetooth speaker to disconnect."" Wtf"
"I'm curious if anyone has come up with a solution to play music from sources other than the third party skill integrated in to alexa. For example, if I found a youtube playlist I'd like to play throughout my home. I frequently listen to BBC Sounds and i haven't found a way to play that on alexa.  I guess what I'm asking is if there is a way to bring the multiroom speaker functionality that you find in spotify to be able to play from any music source. Something like airplay where I can use the alexa speaker simply as an external audio output. I don't mean via bluetooth because that does not have the multiroom option."
"Hey everyone!  So, I recently switched my Alexa's languages to German and English (German being the primary language) and I was wondering if i could still make her have a British accent.  I went into the alexa app and tried my best there but I could only see an option for  ""German/English (United States)""  I hope someone can help :)"
"Next time I say play soft classical music for sleep, don’t suddenly blast a fucking advert that scares me awake when Ive had a shit enough day as it is, and now I’m wide awake knowing I’ve got work in 5 hours, what a fucking stupid design.   Fuck you Alexa, for being just another consumerist gimmick and pushing my temper over the edge, you stupid cunt."
I ask what the temperature outside is. She tells me and follows up asking if I want to know funny gift ideas.  I ask her when King Kong v Godzilla premieres. She answers then asks if I want any new recipe ideas.   All I want to know is what I ask. How do I get her to stop with the extra stuff?
"Hi there,  so I use the Alexa App on my Android device to send a notification to my phone when a door sensor gets opened.   Everytime I open the window I get the notification on my smartphone twice.  I tried all differnt ways of disabling different notifications but I always get 2 notifications like in the screenshot.  I thought there are maybe 2 different notifications going on, because one notification has the bell icon showing.  But either I get no notification or 2.  This is annonying me a bit to be honest.  I didn\`t find a solution on the subreddit so may somone has the same problem or can tell me how to fix it.  &amp;#x200B;  Much thanks :)  https://preview.redd.it/nrzekdrfisr61.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaef68dfc2bf3847951d140166c15ba12db3dc70"
"Hello!  I am looking for an Alexa device that is able to make Skype calls (audio only). Looking around seems like the recent Echo devices (like the Echo Dot 4th gen) are compatible.  However the wife has a severe allergy to dust and we can't have any fabric that we can't frequently wash in the washing machine, and looks like all the Echo devices have fabric on top.  Is there a fabric free Alexa device that is able to do Skype Calls?  The Fire TV Cube is fabric less, but I have not understood if it can make Skype calls or not.  Thanks!"
"Since I started working from home last year, I have been using Alexa to remind me about meetings. I say, Alexa, tell me when it is &lt;time of meeting&gt;, and Alexa would set an alarm.   Now when I say this, she says ""Sorry, I don't know that one"". It works with a friends Alexa but not mine.   Any clues?"
"So I've started the move to the alexa. Bought a firestick tonight. Went to set it up, won't connect to my wifi. Straight out the box. Every other device on my network is working as should. Any suggestions?"
"My Echo Show always shows me great looking recipes - ones that I would be interested in trying down the road. The problem is I only see an option to ""show me the recipe"" right then and there, which isn't very practical. Is there a way to ask Alexa to save the recipes to access at a later time in the app?"
"Hi, a yellow light just started blinking and that is supposed to mean that i have a message or a notification.  When I ask What notifications do I have, the response is that I have none. When I ask What messages do I have, the response is the same but then also saying: By the way, you have one notification. Do you want me to read your notification? Then after I say Yes I got a response - You don‘t have notifications and the yellow light keeps flashing. Does anyone know how can i fix this?"
Considering a Sony Bravia television and says it’s Alexa compatible but wondering what controls it’ll accept.  Power?  Volume?  Inputs?  Can Alexa launch apps?
"I've had my alexa now for a little over a year and have grown quite familiar with it. For the past 2 weeks, something new started occurring. At precisely 2:55am every single night, there is a low volume short beep that it emits. There's no alarms and no notifications. I don't really understand why it started doing this and searching online yielded no results.  What could this be?"
the dipshit thing isn't fucking working. just stands and drools and not doing a fucking thing. alexa is slow as fuck. so what's the fucking point?
"Echo just started beeping and showing blue revolving circle after each reminder. I see no errors in the Alexa app for this device. It won't respond because the revolving blue circle means it's busy ""doing something"".  Only thing I can do is unplug it and plug it back in until the next reminder sets it off again. This is an older device. Four other Echos working great. Any ideas?  Thanks.  edit: clarify issue"
"How many of you are in this group, had Google Home first, but converted?  If you made the switch, which system do you prefer?  Why did you make the switch?  Thank you."
"Hello,  I just bought a Hisense TV and a Sonos beam (a sound bar with a built-in Alexa) but I am struggling setting up everything. It does not work as it should, but I don't understand why.  The Sonos beam recognizes Alexa, as I can play music without any problem. However, commands related to the TV are not working.  In my Alexa app I can see 2 TV. One is a Fire TV, even though I don't have any Fire TV, and the second one is a Living Room TV connected to Sonos.    Why is there a Fire TV connected? I cannot even remove the connection, it's like a default option that you cannot modify for some reasons.  Should I keep Alexa activated on both the TV and the Beam, or only the Beam?  Any help is appreciated, thanks!"
"I have a rather long ""goodnight"" routine that has worked for over a year.  It shuts off the non bedroom lights, says goodnight, gives me a reminder to arm the security system, waits a minute then shuts off the bedroom lights and plays a sleep playlist.     &amp;#x200B;  Its not getting past the goodnight message any more and it makes no sense."

So I recently registered my phone number on my girlfriend and i's Alexa account to try the drop-in feature. I really wasn't a fan of it so I disabled the feature but I want to unregister my phone number from the account. How would I go about doing that? Because I cannot find anywhere in the settings how I would do that.
"When I say ""Alexa: Lucky's been fed"" it works about 70 percent of the time to trigger a routine we have to change the color of a light in the house to indicate the dog's been fed.  But when it doesn't work--and when it doesn't work, it REALLY doesn't work (all evening)--it consistently gives:  ""Sorry, I don't know that. But there's a skill you might like called the Dog Feeder. Want to try it?"" Over. and Over. and Over.  Then the next day, it's fine. She hits the routine perfectly again.  It's like twice a week her ability to understand that phrase goes south--and coincidentally she always recommends (over and over and over) that damn skill which really is beginning to feel like it's  triggering some ad keyword algorithm because otherwise how would it possibly know to link ""lucky's been fed"" to a dog feeder skill.  It's picking up enough of the phrase to figure that out, but can't run my routine??  Maybe I'm paranoid, but it feels like Google keyword type searches, with selected ad campaigns bumping ahead in search results over other things (like routines)."
"As part of my morning routine, Alexa plays the most recent episode of a daily podcast I listen to. After that episode is over, the last item in my routine is to play the radio. After the podcast episode, she always tried to play another precious episode! I always have to stop the routine and then tell her to turn on the radio. Can I “program”my routine to only play the most recent episode and then stop and move on to the next routine item?"
"I'm hoping this sub can help me with a problem I'm having with my Echo devices. When playing music on the ""Everywhere"" group, songs will play for just over a minute, before cutting out. After an extended pause, the next song in the shuffle will start like nothing ever happened, but then it too will cut out, repeating the process. This has happened for several songs in a row now, making music pretty much unplayable. What gives?"

As you can see by the title, I am trying to have my outdoor lights (ran by smart switches) turn on/be enabled to turn on after sunset when my Wyze door lock is unlocked but I am having trouble since it doesn’t let me run this at a given time. I was wondering if there are any workarounds that you guys could think of? Any help is appreciated!!"
"I have an Xbox Series X and Alexa always calls it a ""Series 10"" whenever she talks about it. I changed the device name to ""Xbox Series Ex"" in the Alexa app but it didn't change how she says it. Is there another setting I don't know about?"
"Hoping someone can point me in the right direction, not sure what kind of install to look up...  I have an older surround system setup that was previously controlled by a Control4 automation system. Now, I just have the TV and appletv running through the receiver, basically having to do everything manually.   Is a hub what I need? If so, am I connecting TV, AppleTv, speakers all to the hub? Or can the AppleTv act as my “hub” and receiver/tv goes to that?   I know I will not have full control, just hoping to be able to turn on the tv and control volume by asking Alexa. I use the AppleTv remote app to control AppleTv.   Thank you so much for any ideas!"
"This seems like such a simple requirement so I’m surprised i couldn’t find it with a search on here.  I have Alexa’s in three rooms - Bedroom, Kitchen and Living Room.  All three rooms have multiple smart bulbs. All three rooms have lights we consider “side lights” and additional lights (e.g. ceiling lights, etc).  I have the devices organised into groups, so each Alexa device knows which lights are in its room, and in any room I can say “Alexa, turn off the lights” and it turns off all the lights in the room.  What I want to do is be able to say, in any given room, “Alexa, turn on the side lights” and have just the side lights in that room turn on. I can obviously set up three groups (Kitchen Side Lights, Bedroom Side Lights and Living Room Side Lights) but it seems stupid to have to tell Alexa what room I’m talking about when it should be able to imply that by my absence of room name (just like it does when I say “Alexa, turn on the lights”).   Am I missing something?"
I downloaded a ton of skills originally but I rarely use any of them now except for nature sounds. Feels like I’m missing out on some good stuff but I wanted to ask you all which ones you use the most.
"I asked Alexa to perform a skill this morning, and she did... followed by a fart! Then she said, “ Eek, sorry about that!”"
Set up two different fire sticks both with fire tv blasters... One in the bedroom and the other in the living room. I linked my Alexa devices in the app with their respective fire sticks. If I am in the bedroom and ask for Alexa to turn on or off the TV it turns on or off the living room tv... Extremely frustrating. If anyone has any ideas it would be greatly appreciated.
Good day everyone. I have 4 echos in my house. Normally when someone says the wake word on the tv Alexa wakes up. I have them all set to play a noise upon wake. Plus I can see some of them to acknowledge they are only acknowledging me or someone in person. Just wondering if anyone else had that experience.   Thank you in advance
" I have a running shopping list on the alexa app on my phone. I've been trying to figure out all day why every time I ask Alexa to print my shopping list, I get a blank page. So I go the Amazon website and surprise, there is no list there called Shopping List with my items on it. There is a default list called shopping but it is an Amazon shopping/idea list. I guess it is for ideas that you might like to purchase at some time but it's not a basic list. It is in no way related to the list on my phone. Apparently, when I'm asking Alexa to print my shopping list this blank ""idea"" list is what she is printing? How do I get her to print my ALEXA shopping list by voice?"
"I try everything, I can’t find a way to change my account or disconnect from Alexa with my Samsung Q60 TV"
"What I want is simple. When someone pushes the Ring doorbell, I want Alexa to make the doorbell chime sound, but I don't want her to loudly yell ""someone is at the front door.""

"My Alexa is able to pair with my TP-Link RBG KL130B light and can turn it on, but it can't turn it off or change colours. When I give it a command as such it says okay and nothing happens. If I use the app the make the command, the app will update to the light's true state (probably on, light warm and at 5% brightness) after around 5 seconds. I can use the light bulb's app to interact with it perfectly. I have also repaired the light and renamed it, nothing has worked, any ideas?"
I’ve never said my name with Alexa activated or given her my name and it’s my moms but me and my dad were bored so we asked Alexa “tell me a knock knock joke” and before this my dad told me to do my homework and I was doing it while I asked Alexa for a knock knock joke and she said nothing unusual like “when I say knock knock you say whos there” I did and what she said creeped me out hella lot I say “who’s there” IM NOT KIDDING WHEN I SAY SHE SAID “(my name) doing his homework” me and my dad looked at each other and unplugged the Alexa can someone tell me how dis bitch knew my name when I never said it to her
I recently set up a routine that turns off lights and arms my security system at set time. My security system is armed through a skill and a custom command in the routine.

"So I have an Echo Plus 1st Generation that's my favorite Alexa device that I own, but I know it's been discontinued for some time and I know other companies have a policy of making it so older devices stop working (Apple) but I never heard of Amazon doing something like that so I just wanted to ask if that was the case.  It's been working well for me despite the fact that it's older, and it hasn't really shown any signs of malfunctioning or not working well as far as I can tell."

"I have an hour-long podcast that I like to listen to, and when I ask Alexa to play it, Alexa says she’s playing it now, but then just goes silent. For like 10-20 minutes. Then all of a sudden my podcast starts out of the blue. What’s going on? Is Alexa downloading the entire podcast before playing it? I don’t have slow internet. Anyone experiencing a similar issue?"
"Is there anybody who knows what went wrong here and how to fix it?  We have 5 Alexa devices (dots) and a few weeks ago they stopped reacting. When I got them back online, three of them started to behave as if they were new (they don’t recognise the other two (they are offline according to them, which they aren’t), they do not have old skills available to them, do not recognise smart plugs, lights anymore, etc) whereas the other two came back as “normal” but see the others as offline apparently (e.g. can’t drop in on them).  It might have to do with an account switch I made for a book that wasn’t available on Amazon.com but was so on Amazon.it and so when asked if I wanted to switch accounts, I did so, thinking nothing of it. I thought that perhaps the two “groups” may be on different accounts and that is what is causing all this. Problem is, in the Alexa app I can’t find what account I am on, let alone change it, and now it also gives me some parts in English, others in Italian (skill search results return in Italian and I cannot find the ones in English that I am looking for).  The “new” devices seem to have some nice skills the “old” ones didn’t have. Understanding and answering in two languages, sounding notifications for delivered parcels e.g. Still, I would very much like to have all back in the same “group” again. Anyone any suggestions?"

When I send him a picture through the Alexa app communicate section, he can't see it. He gets a message that says: You received content that cannot be displayed. Upgrade this app to see it.   Does this mean he needs to update the app, or does this mean he needs to pay money to upgrade something in order to see images and use video?"

Does anyway know of a switch that can connect with an Alexa routine via IFTTT or something similar?  Thanks"
"I have a geofence set up for arriving and one for leaving that turns on/off Siriusxm music and lights then sends me a custom notification message that is did that.

"By the way, I can also spam you with more useless suggestions."
"I have been an Alexa user for probably 5-6 years now.  I have a LOT of smart home devices.  Maybe not as many as some of you, but probably more than most of you.  As such, I have to name a LOT of devices.  I keep coming up with one predicament over and over.  Giving an actual example:     I have two ceiling fans that can be controlled, one upstairs, and one in the bedroom.  I know as long as I put them into rooms, I can call both of them ""fan"" and when I tell it to ""turn fan on"" it will turn on the right one.  The problem with this is when I have to do anything manually in Alexa and need to look down the list of devices, there is no way to easily tell the two apart.  Alternately, I can call them ""bedroom fan"" and ""upstairs fan"", but then I get the ""more than 1 devices shares the name 'fan'"" message if I just say fan, so I have to say the full name for it to work right.     This is a singular example.  It gets WAY more complicated when it comes to light bulbs, especially when you consider words like ""lamp"", ""ceiling/overhead"", etc.  It can get real easy to get names confused, which can make it more frustrating for the less techy members of the house.     So....is there some glorious fix/answer out there I don't know about, or do others struggle with this too?"
"Recently I’ve been having issues with a custom lists. Are use a third-party app called “any list“ to communicate with Alexa, My iPhone, my I watch, and my PC.

" I’ve had my echo for a while but have never really got into all the cool things it can do until recently. I ordered a simple security system on Amazon arriving tomorrow and can’t seem to figure out the logic I’ll need to have it be able to arm and de-arm.  It’s a simple door sensor type, and I want to have an alarm play from Alexa when it’s triggered and I’m not home. But I also want to be able to be able to have it turned on only at night, and when I’m not home, but able to turn it off when I come home.  I’ve figured out the when I leave part, such as telling her “I’m leaving now” and have her turn all the sensor on as one routine, and then having a separate routine that tells her what to do if it’s triggered, ie) if sensor is triggered, wait 5 seconds, play alarm and say a custom message. I want it to wait 5 seconds to give me time when I come home to disarm the alarm and not have it play.  My problem comes from I don’t have a panel or anything to disarm it so I would need to use voice, or the app. In theory, what I would like to do is be able to come inside and say “I’m home” and have her turn off all the sensors so they no longer trigger. But in my experience Alexa will still play through a routine once it is triggered. I have a good morning one that plays some alarms and tells me my calandra and if I ask her to stop she will stop the current action and move on to the next one in the routine.   Am I overthinking it, and as long as they are turned off they will no longer trigger? My partner says if she was capable of a “while” routine and not just IFTTT we could make it work. Anybody have an idea of how to make it work?"
"So I just got a echo dot which is our the bedroom for alarms and white noise while sleeping. We have a Roku in our living room, the Roku skill only works from a echo device, not the app.  Is there any way to relay a command to the echo dot from the app? I.e tell the echo dot in the bedroom, to launch Netflix on Roku un the living room? Unfortunately Roku commands on the app just result in Alexa saying it doesn’t understand or trying to open TV guide, whereas it works perfectly on the dot."
"Hi guys, I want to buy an Alexa device like a watch or something that has hands free Alexa built in. Basically something that responds without having to push a button or anything (like how the echo devices work).

"I live in Europe. Alexa is set to the current location/time zone but speaks American English.   She keeps telling me facts about yesterday. For example on March 9th she wished me a happy international woman’s day (March 8th). She told me Sunday to set my clocks back before bed (clocks don’t go back in Europe this week but always go back on a Sunday). She told me about pie day on 3/15.   I can’t figure out why Alexa thinks it is yesterday; the date/time/time one is correct. Any ideas?  I’d love to learn about « this day in history » or « facts about today » on the day it happens, not after."
How to I stop daylight savings in Alexa? I live in Saskatchewan and there is no time zone option for us.. still (after this same problem was posted two years ago). So now my times and clock displays are all wrong. I’ve tried changing the time zone to CST in all options and it still won’t work.
"For some artists, such as Geoxor (pronounced Geo/gee-oh-Saur, like dinosaur if you want to try this out for yourself) for example when I say ""play new music by Geoxor"" for some reason it says ""pixels radio from Pandora."" What I said sounds nothing like this and it says this every time, even when I literally spell out the name G. E .O .X. O. R. it says the same weird Pixels thing. Ok, why not just play a song by them (which for some reason asking Alexa to play music, popular music, or shuffle music by them, those all work just fine, just not recently added music) and then ask Alexa to ""play recently added music by this artist"" THEN it says ""as above, so below radio from Pandora."" What the heck?! That sound nothing like it! And just like the Pixels thing it says this no matter how you word it. If you tell Alexa to play the name of all of their recent songs individually by name, those all work, so what's the problem? I have this issue with some other artists too, but this is the only example I remembered from the top of my head. This isn't a common issue, but a really annoying one."
"I might be just stupid but...my partner and I would simply like to see our thermostats and lights on each of our phones in the Alexa app on iOS. We did the whole Amazon Household sync, but that doesn’t help.   We can control things with our voice since Alexa can hear us both, but it seems impossible for use to see in the app all the devices (and groups) I have on my phone.  We had a pretty fluid setup with HomeKit where my partner would see a mirror of all changes I did, but it was horrible at recognizing voice commands. Devices just wouldn’t respond. Bye to that garbage."
Looking for a button that I could program routines off... I found one that works with apple homekit and one for hue lights but none for alexa would one of you fine people help me out.
"So I have a standard echo. We deactivated it to switch from one account to another. During this, we also got a new wifi router (not sure if this matters). Now when I put it in setup mode, it doesn’t appear anywhere? When I say Alexa, it says “this device isn’t registered” but I’m unsure of how to register it. Any tips? Thanks."
"The default Magic Home Skill has basic commands to work with connected lights, including LED strips, however the Magic Home app comes with heaps of features to do things like colour change fades, flashing colours, you can even setup custom colour changes.  My question is, is it difficult for me to create one or more custom skills in Alexa to take advantage of these functions? What's involved and how do I go about creating such a skill?"
Suddenly one of my echo dots claims my network password is wrong.   All my other echos are working fine. And all the other devices in the house connect to my Wi-Fi without problem.   I unpowered the echo and tried again - no good.   I started the setup process again. As soon as it reaches the point where it asks for the Wi-Fi password it again stated the password is invalid.   I rebooted my router - still no good.   Any suggestions??  Thank you.
"The Alexa energy dashboard is not showing any of my devices. Multiple echo dots, fire sticks, and an official Amazon smart plug, as well as a wifi connected thermostat all connected to Alexa app and functioning, but none are showing up on energy dashboard. Thoughts? Solutions?"
"Is there any way of caching Alexa commands offline? I ask because, to free myself from distractions, I'd like to be able to turn my router off with an Alexa plug.   I figure that will work, but when it comes to turning back on I'll have to physically turn the plug back on with the button, because the internet will be off. That could be a good thing, but is there any way of having Alexa cache the last command so I can turn the internet back on without being on the internet?"
I have a TV connected to a soundbar and a firestick. I would like to give commands to the firestick via voice through the soundbar instead of the firestick remote. Is It possibile? Thank you
"I’m losing my mind, someone please help me.  Alexa play Spotify to my echo dot. She decides to turn on my tv open my fire stick install Spotify (where it is not installed) and open it. Instead of just playing Spotify locally on the echo dot speaker, as I desire.  Do I need to issue a different command to tell her this is NOT a fire tv command?  Thanks in advance."
We have several Alexa devices around our home and as of a few months to a year ago my uncle who lives next door has been getting the announcements on his fire stick also but he’s not in the family or even the same wifi. Any ideas for why this is happening please?  Thanks!
"I have 7 echos throughout my house, recently after adding a dot (plugged into Aux jack on a receiver) I'm getting random glorps when playing music. I changed all my echos to the 2G network but the problem persists. Does this seem like it's a wifi issue that a range booster would correct? Is this possibly caused by too many devices sucking down the signal?  The dot is within 5' of my wifi router but I can't relocate either easily."
"Hi,  I’m after some advice please.  In our family home, I have 3 echos, between my bedroom and office, my Mother has an Echo in the kitchen. Her echo is signed into her Amazon account, and mine are signed into mine. In my setup i have lights, smart plugs etc. In hers, none. We obviously live in the same household, so is it possible for her device to be able to control my smart devices, and vice versa - if we added new ones to hers?  Or is it possible to pair the lights, smart plugs etc to more than one Amazon account?  Thanks,"
We REALLY don’t care for “no problem” as a response. Is there a way to change that response to “my pleasure”?
"Hello. I have well over a dozen routines linked to my Echo Show OG, and I am planning to replace it with the new motorized version of Show. Is it possible to “swap” Echo devices in a manner where I don’t have to adjust 20-ish routines to be linked to the new device?"

"Over the last few days it's been nearly impossible to trigger routines that have worked from a voice command for a year. I'll try 5 or 6 times, and it will do random other crap like bring up a Webster's Dictionary definition for the word ""dinner"" or start playing some random song.  I've started just opening the app and clicking the routines there, but that sort of puts the value of all these devices into question, doesn't it?  Has anyone else noticed a dramatic change for the worse in the last day or two?"
"Long time google home user, but want something with video for calling family now that we moved across the country. I'm torn between the Show 10 and the Portal+ and wanted to know how the tracking works during a call with multiple people. For example, if my wife initiates a call and then my daughter walks in out of view and begins talking, will it swivel between them, or just stay on the person who started the call?"
"Hi - I have been having some issues with routines, and I think I've found a bug.  Any routine that tells Alexa to say custom text fails at that step when invoked from my 1st gen Echo. For example, I have a routine called ""The bridge is yours"" for when I leave that:  * says ""Aye aye, I have the conn. Steady as she goes."" * turns off all the lights * sets guard mode to away  What can I say, I grew up watching Star Trek. When invoked from my 2nd and 3rd gen devices, it works. When invoked from my 1st gen echo, it fails at the step with the spoken item. If I put that step last, it executes the other items, then fails, if first, it fails at that point. However, if I put a five second wait just before the utterance, even as the first step, it works.  Since this is my only 1st gen device, I'd love to know if this is endemic to the breed. I deregistered and reset - no help. Other routines work fine. I was able to repeatably create the error with a test routine of one step that just says a custom phrase when invoked. Note that canned phrases work fine, it's the custom ones that don't. Any thoughts or comments, especially other 1st gen owners?"
"It's just one single boop sound, I can't find what it could be, it's not an alarm.  For a week or so I thought it was a neighbour connecting his phone to his car, but then suspected it was one of my devices.  Any idea?"
"Hi,  i have 2 Alexa enabled device: 1x Echo 1. gen 1x Sonos One and i have some routines where i get some spoken feedback.  This was working fine since ~3-4weeks on both devices. On the Sonos speaker it still working fine but if i use the echo the routines are still running but the part where the echo should talk it is silent.   I already created a test routine, reseted the echi but the spoken part is still silent.  Any idea?"
"If I ask her to read my calendar, she reads 4 events and then asks if I want to hear the rest. But if 'read my calendar' is part of my morning routine, she just reads the first 4 events and then skips straight to the next action in the routine."
"So I have a JVC smart tv with Alexa functionality built in, I have linked it to my echo dot and it can control it once on. It can also turn it back on shortly after turning off but when the tv has been off for a while the Alexa cannot turn it on. Just wondering if there’s a simple workaround?"
"I just bought a house and I am getting a Ring doorbell and Echo Show 8 for a monitor. Is there a good deadbolt that also works with the Echo Show, so I can just say ""Alexa open door"" or something instead of having to manually open the door?"
"I have several lamps that are difficult to get to turn them of, one one I use a clapper to turn it on and off   I would like to be able to turn my lights off with Alexa, I but I think I may need several smart plugs, since each light is plug into a different outlet"
"Let me preface this by saying I really hope this makes sense, lol. We received a notification on our devices last night and it was a message from someone we don’t know. All it said was “hey”. We were able to pull up the contact from the app to see who it was and it was a local number but I can’t find any information linked to it, or a person with the name that was linked to the number on the app. Has anyone ever received a spam message on their device?"
"Sometimes I wake up earlier than usual, trigger the ""Good Mornings Alexa"" routine by voice, and then while I'm in the shower or having breakfast my morning alarm starts and I have to go to the bedroom just to turn it off.  I've looked around in the settings but couldn't find a way to turn off in the routine. It would be so helpful to have the alarm not trigger if I got off the bed already..."

I’m partially hard of hearing and when Alexa adds ‘enjoy your day’ or other pleasantries it  makes it much harder for me to understand what she said before.   Any way to shut this off so she just replies with just the answer ? Thanks.
"I saw a post about this a while ago and no one came up with a solution. Every morning at 6am, Alexa announces the weather. There is no one in the house but me, I have only one routine set, which is to play a briefing upon me saying “good morning”. That’s it, no other routines or skills, nothing. Alexa just started doing this about 2 weeks ago totally on her own.   WTF?"
So I got a new router and my Alexa has stopped working on my sound bar and 3 smart plugs. I can’t change or connect any of them to the new WiFi. Has anyone had this problem or does anyone know a solution???

"I recently got into Magic the Gathering Arena and wanted a way to pick a random deck to play each round.  So I looked up making skills for Alexa and made my own with the list of 70 decks that I have.   So I just say ""Alexa open Magic Deck List"" and then she says a little catchphrase like ""Cast Fireball"" with a sound effect, then gives me one of my random deck names.  It's kinda fun to have her pick for me."
Hi guys. My Alexa is censoring swearing in songs by lowering the volume when the word is said or by distorting the word. I’m trying to listen to Godzilla by Eminem and she won’t even say the word alcohol. Is there anyway to change this? My profanity filter is off as the song title says explicit.
"Obviously it wouldn't work if someone's unconscious, but I was curious if anyone's tried using Alexa as emergency monitor for someone who's fallen and can't get up.  I.e. asking Alexa to call 911."

I always use Alexa to convert measurements from cups to grams so I don’t have to touch my phone while cooking. I used to say “How many grams in one cup of all purpose flour?” She would tell me 120. Now she is saying strange numbers like .07284832. How do I fix this?
Any skill that will show Alexa's system uptime?
"Am I alone in this? I thought my device had an issue, but I got a new one on xmas, and it does the same thing.  This did not use to be the case.  I now just say it as 1 one 'alexalexa' to get the thing to do anything."
I wanted to link the music I was listening to in my phone to my Alexa Echo Dot. It used to work but it wont show up anymore. Could it be possible it;s got something to do with the fact that my Unlimited subscription just finished?

"Now you can set a Routine to only run on specific days of the week. Previously, you could only run it on one specific day, all weekdays, or all weekend days. Now you can choose which days of the week you want the Routine to run.  This is such a minor improvement that improves Routines tremendously."
"I regifted the 8 yesterday and reset everything to factory settings when we re-set up  it in the living room it now does everything the 10 does in my bedroom,example when I set  a alarm  it sets the same alarm out in the living room, or when I turn off lights via voice,it does it for both rooms. I can't have this going on like this how do I delink it?nobody seems to know"
"Recently discovered something pretty cool about the integration between these two devices that I’ve found myself using all the time and thought I would share.  You can say “Alexa, play [name of YouTube video] on youtube” and Alexa will say “Getting that for you” and play the video on your TV. You can even then ask her to skip the ads!"
I'm having a tough time finding what I need! I want to use a doorbell camera powered by PoE and record the video on my home server. It needs to integrate with Alexa. Has anyone found or used a doorbell that checks all of these boxes?
A while back I was waking myself up to a song  And Alexa asked if I wanted to make that song my default alarm tone so I said yes I now want to change what song as my default alarm tone but I can't seem to figure out how to make Alexa do that anymore.
"But it is Alexa...it is available. This was working flawlessly for a long time. I could just say 'Play Groove Salad' and it would just start from TuneIn. Now, not a single TuneIn station plays.  If I go into the Sonos App or the Alexa app I can begin playback of any TuneIn station. But asking with a voice command I get 'That station is not available right now'.  I spent 40 minutes on a chat with Amazon helpdesk, reset devices and reconnected, nothing worked.  (The skill level of the chat person was questionable to say the least, I felt like I knew the product way better than they did)"
"So my problem is this.  I just set up a Google home system, with Google assistant in my phone, and one Nest mini device at home. Since I live in Finland (Finnish is not supported by Google home yet), I have to keep my phone's language in English, otherwise Google Assistant won't get the voice commands. The problem is that my wife and kid would also like to use the routines i have set up, but i can't assume they would also change their phones' language to English. And the routines won't work unless they install Google home apps in their phones, and change the whole phone's language to English.  So the question is, if I change my system to Alexa and get a Echo dot, am i still gonna have the same problem? Does my family members also have to load the app, install the routines, and keep their phones' language on English, to be able to use my routines?"
"  Many lights in our house are connected to Alexa and for the most part make it incredibly convenient. Except last night, our baby was crying so I went to go check on him and the nursery light was on 10%. I checked the command history and it nothing in the history indicated that it should be on. Side note, we also almost always turn it to 1% or 100% never really in the middle but I don’t think that actually matters too much. When I opened the app to turn it off it notified me that the echo dot was offline or dropped internet connection. I forget how it was worded. Can a drop in internet on the dot cause a light to turn on? They’re in the same “group” on the app if that makes a difference?"
"I seem to have a year's worth of misc alarms in the Alexa app. They are not in use and show as off. Dozens upon dozens. I would like to delete them but you have to click on each and hit delete individually. Problem is it VERY slow to open each alarm IF in fact it opens it at all. Which is usually a ""not at all"". Any trick to deleting them all at once?"
"All the Grovee led stripes I have are all Unresponsive in the alexa app. But work thru the grovee app, has anyone else had this issue or know a solution"
"I am having an issue that I cannot seem to get to the bottom of even after chatting with Amazon Support.  In my main room I have an Echo Dot 2nd Gen, across the room an Echo Flex and now temporarily an iLive Platnium Concierge that I recently got.  Anyway, even though I don't have Flex set to preferred  speaker, if I tell the Echo or Concierge ""Volume 3"" for example, they will adjust the Flex unless I say ""Set Dot Volume 3"" or something. The Flex just adjusts itself.  Also if I tell the Dot or Concierge to play Pandora for example, it starts on the Flex unless I say ""On Dot"" or ""On Platnium"".  The only way that seems to ""fix"" it is to take Flex out of the room group but then it has less convenience then."
"Topic kind of says it all. Alexa cannot stop giving me followup tips after alarms or todo additions. It's always ""by the way, you can blah blah blah"". This is extremely disruptive when working, especially as it chimes in mid meeting. I've already turned off the setting in the alexa app ages ago and confirmed it's still off, but Alex doesn't care. For a period of time it did get quiet but it starts right back up in other periods. The fact that my device doesn't adhere to its settings makes it borderline worthless for productivity and real work.  I've basically paid money to have a device spout ads at me. I've had my alexa (first gen, first ever alexa) for years along with the dots i've added and this is bad enough that I think i'm ready to change eco systems. Does google have this same issue? I have hesitated going to them since I'm already so bought in but this is not sustainable."
I asked her to convert a cup of peanut butter to grams and a cup of flour to grams. She’s giving me weird answers like .074748 grams instead of 120g. Is there a way to reset this?

"Lol so the other day when Tesla’s stock dropped alexa just blurted out that Elon was the 2nd richest, suggesting that Jeff once again the first.  Did this happen to anyone else?"
"I have several [NiteBird Smart Light Bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0824HJ4NN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). A couple of them, when powered off (but still connected to power source) make an annoying noise. It's a high pitched noise that's a bit difficult to describe. It's not a continuous whine, but more of an intermittent squeaking. One Amazon reviewer described it as being similar to the sound of crickets chirping. Apparently a lot of different brands of light bulbs have issues with making noise when powered off.  Here are some questions/reviews from Amazon describing the issue:  &gt;Why am I hearing muffled criquet noise from the bulbs? It’s kinda annoying and migraine inducing...   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Are the light buzzing sounds normal? When I turn off the bulb from my phone or Alexa voice control, there is a constant noise, almost like a very light, somewhat muffled criquet noise... every single bulbs are the same, are mines broken? ...  there is a light constant buzzing sound when we turn off the bulb from the phone app. At first the noise  didn’t bother much, but I started noticing a change in my sleeping  pattern. And I started waking up restless, exhausted and sometimes with  heavy migraines that just stopped when we completely disconnected the  bulb from the bedroom. The chirping noises  stop when we completely disconnect the bulbs (which cancels the whole  purpose of the automatic on/off schedule feature, or just turning off  the lights via phone or Alexa.   The animals (especially the dogs) also  looked slightly bothered by it so I am quite sceptic and hope it did  not harm their ears and/or affect hearing.   In overall, it’s cool at  first and a great value but I don’t recommend it for anyone suffering  from Chronic migraines (as Dr visits+medications will override the  costs) especially if you are sensible to noise.  It doesn’t bother my husband much so I’d say that most people aren’t  bothered. However, we definitely went to buy the more expensive Phillips  hue light bulb to avoid the chirping noises. I wanted to love these bulbs soooo bad but anything that triggers my migraines gets a hard pass..   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Good bulbs however when they are powered off they make a high-pitched squeaking noise  that kept me up throughout the whole night. However, when the light  switch was off it wasn’t heard. Intersting.  I had to take them out  because I could not get it to stop making that horrible noise.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The  only issue is these lights make a chirping/buzzing sound even when the  lights are off. I had to rearrange my light layout because I couldn’t  keep these lights in my bedroom as they were keeping me awake at night. I  plan to just keep them for use in the kitchen, living room, and hallway  bathroom as i do not hear those noises from room in those spaces. Anyway, great deal, easy setup, but low constant noise.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;But when you're ready for that cozy, deep sleep and go to turn off the lights, you will experience their screaming bat noises  that rip through your ears and make you want to succumb to  lamp-smashing rage.  They work great with Alexa... even when you're  telling Alexa to turn up the volume on your white noise playlist just to drown out the piercing sounds while contining to convince yourself you made a good purchase.    If you simply love shrill exorcist noises  with mood lighting, this is the smart bulb for you. For those who have  enough to deal with on the daily and enjoy sleeping, skip it - you'll be  happier living in the dark.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;When turned ""off"" or dimmed via command on Alexa they emit a low buzzing noise.  &amp;#x200B;  Some of those are a bit over-the-top, but it *is* annoying. Does anyone know how to make it stop? Again, it only seems to happen for 2-3 of the bulbs (I have about a dozen overall)."
"Yesterday, I set up a routine for a pomodoro-style work session, i.e., a set of 25-minute timers punctuated with five-minute breaks. It worked the first time, but Alexa stopped responding to my command. Instead, her blue halo would briefly flash without any response or audio cue. Tech support asked me to reset my device, but I decided to leave it for the next day. Curiously, it worked fine again this morning, but yet again Alexa has stopped recognizing my command. Any ideas as to what might be causing this?"
"Hey guys, so I'm trying to get a light sensor for my office that can be paired directly to Amazon's Echo 4th Gen I own. In other words, a Zigbee light sensor that doesn't need any other hub and that Alexa can identify as a light sensor. Is there anything around that does that?  FYI, I bought the Mijia Light Sensor from Xiaomi and although it's Zigbee 3.0 and Alexa does find the device, it can't do anything with it as far as routines go.  &amp;#x200B;  If there isn't, what's the solution?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks :)"
I bought an Alexa for my house and loved it.  I then bought one for a rental/holiday home we have. All work off my own Alexa account.   &amp;#x200B;  I use smart plugs in both houses. My concern is that from time to time Alexa hears teh wrong command and acidity turns on a plug in the other house.   &amp;#x200B;  Is the a way of separating the Alexas or do I need to set up a new account and email address for each house.?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks.
Is there a command for this? Or a way to put custom commands?
"I use one dot as glorified Bluetooth speaker for my desktop pc. The sound setting on my pc are weird so I have to put Alexa at Volume 7 for normal loudness. Which culminates into her screaming HER voice at the top of her lungs! She’s red circle silenced, but the Bluetooth confirmation still makes me jump everyday. How do I take Alexa voice completely? Ariel the mermaid Style."
"Plz note, I'm not an amature. I've had these things for a bit and I can circumvent the problem by using longer sentence to specify the device to play on.  But this shouldn't be necessary. Furthermore, it should at least play on all the devices in the group and not a random echo in the house. I'm upstairs and it plays a device downstairs. Stupid."
"I set everything up and all the devices show up in the group, however it only plays on 2 of them."
I can create a reminder: Alexa remind me in 15 minutes to take out the trash. And I can tell it to turn on a specific plug: Alexa turn on the bathroom light. I would love to tell it: Alexa in 15 minutes turn on the bathroom light. Or even Alexa in 15 minutes turn on the bathroom light for 5 minutes.  That'd be great.
"Alexa says that (""something went wrong"") about 10 seconds after answering my question, sometimes. Started doing that yesterday."
"Our boy needs to go to sleep at night and the Alexa Echo Dot he has distracts him sometimes. I started setting up the parental controls for it so he couldn't play with it past a certain time, but then it wouldn't play the skill for fan sounds to help him sleep. Is there a way to select which Alexa skill can play when it is on sleep mode? Thank you!"
"I had the ""inspired"" idea- at midnight, of course- to set things up so that I could shout at Alexa to put my pc into sleep mode, should I forget to turn it off and be all comfortable in bed. I figured that downloading the Alexa for Windows app would let me do that- but it doesn't seem to. I googled around a bit and got very confused, since most of the answers were not only from a few years ago but also mentioned technical tricks that... frankly leave me confused.   Is it easy/possible to set up what I'm thinking of?  (And, why doesn't the Alexa for Windows app have routines or alarms or timers? The closest I get to routines is my smart-home section, which is useful- but not nearly as useful as setting up the more complex actions I have on my actual Echo Dot.)"
"Hi,  Gave my friend an Alexa echo which i got through work. All seems to work, except Spotify.  Keep getting the msg that Spotify is no longer available due to geographical restrictions.

Anybody know a way to fix it?"
"I just installed 4 sensors in my garage that alert me through an app, and I have a separate routine for each one to have lights come on in the house and a small alarm. Problem is, I can turn off notifications in the app so it doesn't bother me when I go to the garage, but it still alerts alexa so my routines fire! Does anyone know of an easy way or routine to disable multiple routines? And I know I can set a time on the routine but I go into my garage at different times."
"I just discovered the Anylist app for creating my shopping list. I understand that Amazon Alexa can sync with Anylist.    &amp;#x200B;  I have done the following:   1.)

I have enabled Amazon Alexa syncing on the Anylist app.   When I verbally ask Alexa, ""Add milk to shopping list,"" my Amazon Alexa confirms that it has added milk to my shopping list. When I got look, I see that Alexa has added milk to the Alexa Shopping List, but does not add milk to the Anylist Shopping List. How do I get Amazon Alexa to add milk to the Anylist Shopping List?        ."
Good afternoon fellow Alexa enthusiasts.   So I am trying to find a way in which I can get a protective covering for an Alexa speaker (preferably one that can be drilled into brick). So that way I can enjoy my music while grilling my favorite food. Any of you have ideas on how to do this or do you have a similar project you’ve done? It’s hard to find exactly what I’m looking for because every time I’ve searched I found things that weren’t what I’m looking for.
"It started happening over 2 weeks ago. First they started to be a little slow in the head, then they wouldn't change the nest thermostat after saying that it was changed to x degrees.  Every day it was something new and eventually now they are all just talking to each other because one starts talking then it says something like ""just say, alexa help"" and then another alexa will start talking and it gets really weird.  If I say ""alexa, set the timer for x minutes"" it'll take a while before it turns on and then it does a circling thing then it will set a timer. 10 seconds later, another dot will repeat, until all the nearby devices created individual timers.  It gets weirder, I can ask a question, and i get a different answer. Is it raining? Yes, it's raining but Alexa says there's no chance of rain today. I ask again and she'll say ""yes, it is currently raining"".  I might ask facts and it'll give me random things at times.  Then to shut her up it takes a few tries. ""Alexa, stop"" \*still talks\* then of course another alexa device hears me say alexa, so that one starts talking.  I have 1gbps dedicated business class internet. It's well configured, I reach close to top speeds on all bands.  There's no nearby neighbors and there's no downtime either. Alexa has officially gone insane. lol"
"My apple tv remote no longer works. Apple tv is linked to my smart tv and the smart tv is connected to the smart things app. The smart things app is connected to Alexa which has stopped functions on some of the cable box remotes and now my apple tv remote works. Although the smart tv has all of the same applications as apple tv, I prefer to use apple tv within my smart tv, preference, but the remote no longer works- any advice on how to get the apple tv remote working again?"
"TLDR: is there a way to pair the upstairs harmony hub with the upstairs Alexa so that scenes can only be accessed/controlled by a singular echo?  I have a Logitech Harmony hub paired as a skill with Alexa that we use control our upstairs TV with.  However my 4 year old likes to tell the downstairs echo to control the downstairs tv and we have nothing setup for the TV downstairs and it just turns off/on/volume to the TV upstairs. After going through the settings on the harmony, Alexa, SmartThings I can’t seem to figure out a way to pair the Alexa directly to the scene that is imported through the Logitech skill.  Any help is appreciated and now that I am at the end of this and realize it’s not that long and a TLDR probably wan’t necessary..."
Is there a Alexa device that I can use as a speaker for my Xbox and non smart TV (or at least one of them)?   I think echo studio has such option but am not sure.  What do you use your Alexa for?
"Alexa, Im getting tired of your lighting connection glitches youre ruining my morning wake up routine!   Connectivity issues with connecting to certain lightbulbs are causing my echo to just not turn on the light with my set mooring routine. ive added play music with turn on lights, and the lights just dont come on! i cant rely on Alexa"
"How do I set a routine for Alexa to open ""News by Fire Tv"" app ??"
"Anyone else have this issue ... and if so what did you do to fix it.  I have an Alexa Show and a Alexa Show 5 (waiting on 2 more Show 5's).   &amp;#x200B;  I had both my Google and MSN calendar &amp; email linked to my Alexa ... I don't recall unlinking it in any way. When asking ""Alexa, what's on my calendar?"" it responds with ""It looks like I no longer have access to one of your calendar accounts because your log in has expired, please relink your account by visiting calendar settings in the Alexa app.""  &amp;#x200B;  I unlinked all accounts. However, when I tried unlinking the Google account, it seems to get stuck in a loop.   &amp;#x200B;  Steps I took to unlink the Google account:  1.) Went to Calendar &amp; Email in the settings of the Alexa app  2.) Tapped on my Google account.  3.) Tapped on unlink.  4.) Tapped on confirm unlink.  5.) This goes to another settings page with ""Google"" in the top center, then has the Google G with Unlink Account to the right of it. I tapped on unlink account.  6.) Tapped on confirm unlink account. After doing this, an error saying ""Could not retrieve the list of persons belonging to this account"" in a blue pop down banner at the top of the screen. After the banner disappears, it leaves you on the screen from # 5 above. Trying to do the unlink again on this page just loops through # 5 &amp; # 6.  &amp;#x200B;  However, if I close the app and reopen it and go back to the Calendar &amp; Email settings, it comes up with a list of account types you can link (Google, Microsoft, Apple &amp; Microsoft Exchange)... and doesn't show any linked account. When I ask ""Alexa, what's in my email"" it replies with No accounts linked and to link an account. If I ask what's on my calendar, it replies with the ""It looks like I no longer have access to one of your calendar accounts because your log in has expired, please relink your account by visiting calendar settings in the Alexa app.""  &amp;#x200B;  I've linked my Google account (only) again, and when I ask what's on my calendar, it repeats the log in has expired error, and then says John you have 2 events today, the first one is.........  &amp;#x200B;  When the Google account is the only one linked on the Calendar &amp; Email it shows 1 linked account, 2 default calendars for new events (once under for your voice and once under for other voices). And when I go to turn on the calendar notifications, it show my Google account twice and I'm only able to turn on one of them.  &amp;#x200B;  I went through the linking and unlinking so many times that it now says ""It looks like I no longer have access to TWO of your calendar accounts because your log in has expired, please relink your account by visiting calendar settings in the Alexa app."" It also show my Google account 3 times under the ""Turn on notifications"" settings page and only able to turn on one of them.  &amp;#x200B;  Things I've tried (while chatting with Alexa support) is: power cycling the modem/router, power cycled both Alexa's at the same time leaving them unplugged for at least a minute, factory resetting one of the Alexa devices, uninstalling and reinstalling the Alexa app, (multiple) unlinking and linking of the Alexa app, I'm able to set up a new calendar event using the web browser on my computer, but it won't allow me to create a new event using my voice through the Alexa device, unlinking the account then signing out of the Alexa app then signing back in and relinking the account.  &amp;#x200B;  From what I can see/figure out, it's only affecting my Google account as I'm able to link and unlink my MSN &amp; Apple accounts without any visual errors, and it's only affecting my calendar sections as I'm not getting any errors when asking what's in my email.  &amp;#x200B;  What could be going on ... to me it almost sounds like it's creating a phantom account????"
"Hope they will be in development soon.   What I mean by this i  a routine that can branch into two or more actions based on conditions.  The simplest example would be I say alexa good morning, and if it is a weekday, Alexa does abcdef, but if it is on the weekend Alexa does abcxy.  For example, when I say good morning,  Alexa turns on the TV and tune to a specific news channel; I want her to do that each weekday, but I don't watch TV on the weekends so I would prefer she not turn on the TV then.  I could imagine situations where I would like different actions to the same phrase depending on the time of time."
"I'm trying to set up multiple Alexa devices to play music when I ask it to play on a group. When setting up the group, I select one device, and then all other devices immediately show a network error, no matter what device I first select. All the devices are on the same network.  Any advice on how I can get this to work? I have done this before, but I feel like I'm missing a step."
"This is a highly specific routine and I am hoping some tech wizard here can help me set it up on my Echo dot. TIA!   Background info: I am a snoozer who needs 5 alarms everyday (mon-sat) to wake up. 7:30 AM to 8:00 AM at 5 minute intervals. Sometimes I wake up with the second, sometimes with the third.   I want to set 5 alarms that repeat everyday of the week except Sunday and then a routine (Eg: ""Alexa, I'm up"") that will switch of all pending + snoozed alarms ONLY FOR THAT DAY. I want them to be on for the next day. Followed by the usual weather and today's calendar events.  What I tried but did not work: Set 5 alarms that repeat 6 days a week. Woke up at the second, said ""Alexa, cancel all alarms for today"". All the alarms were disabled but weren't enabled again for the next day."
"I'm thinking about getting an echo show and blink cameras instead of a traditional baby moniter for our newborn. My concern is I have a 7 year old with ASD that likes to ""stim"" on alexa. He will ask her to spell 10 to 20 words and repeats commands for hours if allowed. Is there a way to limit Alexa's ability to listen to his prompts?  Thanks!!!"
Is there a way Alexa can find my phone when it’s on silent?
"My goal Is create an routine can play lastest episodes from my favorite podcast, using only routines not voice dictation.  So I create a routine using personalized command.  Play Podcast emilcar daily on Spotify Play Podcast emilcar daily on TuneIn  Doesn't work  So I create by other way Chosen music, then source Spotify or TuneIn, then put emilcar daily podcast.   So works but play without count last episode, play all episodes even if you stopped and later repeat same order Alexa play resume episode when you leave instead of play most recent episode from our podcast.  So there's any solution??"
I use the announcement feature to call all my kids to the dinner table. I do this verbally. However now every time I open the Alexa app on my phone what seen like old announcements pop up. Com idea why this would be ?
"I've already created commands for putting my PC to sleep, locking it, pausing/playing, controlling volume, swapping between extending screen and one screen only, and launching Netflix. I've got this incorporated into Samsung smart things to come up in the Alexa app as devices, and now I want to do more!  Anyone got any ideas for what I can do next? Or if anyone else uses it, are there anythings you do that you find especially useful?"

"I would really just like it to show the clock or even better the timer in the middle of the screen when I set one but it always has to change.  It is always changing or flicking to some sort of advice and distracting me when I'm working.  I was finally able to get it to stop showing annoying news and cooking advice, I was able to turn everything off.  But every once in a while it still shows some tip or something changes and distracts me.  This could be so good, it's just frustrating, I like minimalist stuff and no distraction, I might move the unit in to another room and just bring my echo dot in to the office."
I only see how to turn off Amazon Shopping notifications for all devices. Is it possible to shut them off for just one echo dot?
"I have an Amazon Echo Dot and a Fire TV.  So, I just asked my Echo Dot to play some music at volume two. Everything started fine, until suddenly, it automatically skipped the song and then stopped playing music. At the time, I thought, okay, maybe my mom was using our Spotify. Just to make sure that that was really happening, I asked Echo to play the same song again. It started playing again, except now it was playing at a higher volume - approx volume five. Since my family is sleeping upstairs, I quickly told Echo to stop the music. It stopped for a brief moment, so I manually set the volume to low. But then it suddenly started playing again, at about volume seven. I quickly told it to stop the music, and then I unplugged the Echo. After about a minute of standing there being freaked out, my Fire TV, turns on by itself, and then turns off again right after. I go to unplug it too.  Has anything like this happened to any of you recently, because I have no idea whats going on here."
" I bought RGB light bulbs so I can control the lights with voice command. But I also want to be able to control the lights with a dimmer wall switch. However it is VERY hard to find any smart dimmer wall switch compatible with RGB bulbs because the bulbs already have a built-in dimmer     Here are the features I'm looking for   \- Wired wall switch with dimmer (no battery)   \- Sync brightness % and on/off state between dimmer and wall switch. So if I close the lights with Alexa voice command I still want to be able to open it back using the wall switch   \- NO delay, lights should turn on instantly     I currently have no hub but I can buy one if needed.     Please recommend me a smart wall switch for my use case!"
"I disabled the SmartThings skill, but the devices are still all there.  Why? Do I really have to delete them all manually? That's incredibly dumb and frustrating if so."
"Hey there. So my echo is plugged to an external speaker. I don’t want to use Sonos even though the house is full of them (I am connected to a Wifi network that has a dozen of them and it’s a nightmare to specify which is which). I uninstalled the Sonos Skill.   For some reason whenever I want to listen to something, Echo keeps repeating Sonos is offline and I have to specify that I want the content to be broadcasted on the speaker. It’s a hassle even though I have set the said speaker as the default speaker. How can I make her forget about Sonos altogether ?   Thanks everyone."
"Anyone else notice how alexa gets Jeff Bezos age wrong? My wife asked Alexa how old he was as I was reading an article about him stepping down, his age was correct in the article. A friends one does it too.  Quick Google didn't seem to reveal anything unless I missed something. Thought it was amusing."
“Alexa play my ___ playlist on Apple Music/Spotify”  “I’m sorry. I’m having trouble playing the music.”  This is ridiculous. My Homepod never had these issues. How can I fix this?  I can play Spotify from my iPhone on the Echo just fine.
"Hi all. I searched the forum but couldn't find anything.  I just bought an Alexa echo dot. I opened the accompanying app on my phone and went to settings to get Alexa to learn my voice but every time I ask her to recognize my voice or learn my voice she says ""at this time I'm having trouble learning your voice""  Does anyone know what I can do?  &amp;#x200B;  I've been trying for two hours now to find a solution but there's nothing online.   &amp;#x200B;  I contacted Amazon customer care but the guy I was talking to had no idea and just sent it on to technical support who are going to keep me informed he said.  &amp;#x200B;  Can anyone help me please."
"The app is well organized, but the web UI is just... bad.  For power users like myself, this means I have to do everything from my phone, which is far from optimal."

"How do I get Alexa on Spotify to play a specific playlist?  For example, I want it to play a specific “Chill Vibes” playlist created by one user...but there are many playlists named “Chill Vibes.”"
"I can’t use any other devices to listen to podcasts and so far the only podcast episode-related commands for alexa that i’ve figured out is to tell her to play the latest episode, and play the previous episode. Is there any way to get alexa to play a specific episode without saying “play previous” 20 times?"
"It seems she gets confused anytime I ask her to do something like this. She says she can’t, or starts playing all new music.  I want her to just take what is currently playing on one speaker, and play it on all of them.  Is this not possible?"
35m here. There’s a skill for alexa called sleepsounds .io and I’ve enabled it a long time ago. Since then I have been listening to different sounds while trying to fall asleep. I came across a story called Riki Tiki Tavi - it’s about a mongoose that gets found by a family that saves him and he then saves the family from snake attack. I almost always fall asleep while listening to the same story and never got bored of it - always setting sleep timer to 30 minutes so alexa turns off and doesn’t wake me up later in the night. I was wondering if any of you found any other forms of skills that help you fall asleep if so please share.
"Hi, I would like to be able to control the tv with an echo dot the same way as if I was pressing the microphone button. Is this possible? Basically I would like the tv to be a screen and speakers for my echo dot"
just got 3rd gen Amazon Dot Echo the Voice is muffled compared to Dot 2nd gen...they sent new one the same. I understand the equalizer only works on Music? not Alexa's Voice? True or False. Amazon tech has NO CLUE!
"I just want loud notifications from a generic bluetooth speaker to let me know when my packages arrive to my house, will connecting alexa to a generic bluetooth speaker work for such?"
 I need to turn on a (gosund) socket every hour that will be on for 5 minutes. I'd only like for it to turn on when I am home though.  Is this possible?  I'd happily purchase a different socket if that's what is required to make it work.  I've found no viable way to do this thru GH.  I'm still new enough to this that I'd readily switch to the Alexa ecosystem if she can handle this task.
"I am playing TuneIn Radio on a group.  I have told Alexa to stop, cancel etc a bunch of times.   She refuses to shut up!  I cant get Tune in to stop.  I muted it for a bit but after it unmutes it continues."
"Hi all,  I've been using Google Home for a few years and over past few months its been getting worse with constantly not doing basic things.  On GH to add family members you had to create accounts for them and then invite to your home setup. This we never done as they could then take full ownership of your stuff and even remove devices and yourself from it.  Now we got an echo yesterday and would like to know if you can get it to recognise family members without having to create an account for them or add them to your household (as found out they share your payment cards and could spend on it)  So can this be easily done?"
"Everything was working fine until like a month ago. Alexa always says that the bulbs aren't responding. Updated bulbs' firmware, tried resetting them. I can control them from my phone, but Alexa doesn't work anymore for some reason... any suggestions?"
"When I first got ti, it used to understand everything, now Alexa can't understand basic stuff if I tell her to lose yourself she'll start Playing some random other song. If I ask her basic questions like the protein content in an egg white or a simple calculation she won't be able to answer that. The only thing she can do properly now is turn on/off the lights and even in that, 10% of the time she'll listen and say ok but won't do anything idk what's happening"
"Any ideas why the Alexa web interface is so much less powerful than the mobile?  I would love to be able to program my routines via a bigger screen, but somehow can't."
Super annoying when I tell her to delete the notifications and have to stick around to confirm each time verbally.
"I’ve search through the sub and Google, I’m baffled that this isn’t a thing."
"I have one alarm that i use and it wakes me up everyday, can i somehow use it on Alexa?"
"Hi,  We've been using the Google home products for the past few years and due to ongoing issues have decided to switch a unit out for alexa to see how it performs.  We have two harmony hubs with remotes and with Google to get them both working with home products you had to setup on different Google accounts, then invite user and move devices to the single home.  Is there a way to do this with alexa. I have one remote connected and working, but looking to see if there is a way to link the other remote in similar fashion to how you do with Google.  I'm also using android devices for configuration.   Thanks"
"Many of us are working from home these days due to COVID, including me.  Yesterday during my work day I was interviewing someone and I mentioned the university they got their degree from. Tonight I am getting ads from that university.  This is not a university I would ever go to, nor ever googled for any reason whatsover.  I am not even interested in going back to college (too old for that). I am in marketing myself, and cannot fathom why any marketer would serve me up that ad, I am definitely NOT the target market.   It's clear to me there's no other way I'd have been served that ad other than being listened to by Alexa during that job interview. Which was only just yesterday.  Which is really disconcerting. What else is she listening to about my work and company? What if I'm listening to my company meeting or other confidential meeting without earphones / headphones? What is she hearing? Who is she relaying that information to?"
I connected it to my LG TV. All it will do is turn the volume up and down. For Netflix and AT&amp;T TV do I have to have a firestick? I’ve linked an unlinked the Hulu skill from the app on my phone but it won’t actually do anything. It’s possible I’m just an idiot and I’m doing this wrong.
"I bought a used third generation for work and I love it, but listening to the alexa fourth gen somethings just missing. I don't know exactly what but the third gen just sounds more enjoyable for me.   Exactly whats the difference between the fourth gen and third gen? The vocals and stuff sound clearer but it doesn't really sound like there is any bass to it and it kind of ruins the experience for me."
In the Alexa app some of the lights are in the wrong rooms. I can’t seem to find a way to delete or edit them? Any advice?
"I've built Alexa skills before, but not in a while, so I'm working through this basics tutorial. However the tutorial seems to be missing a step. In step 5, it shows a screenshot of the skill being invoked, responding with a prompt for the user's birthday, and then the user invoking the `CaptureBirthdayIntent` by responding to the welcome response. Here's the specific page:  [https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/get-deeper/tutorials-code-samples/build-an-engaging-alexa-skill/module-4](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/get-deeper/tutorials-code-samples/build-an-engaging-alexa-skill/module-4)  This does not happen when I follow the code changes in the tutorial. I send ""open cake time"" and hear the prompt for my birthday, but when I respond with my birthday, it just says ""sorry I couldn't do what you asked"". What am I missing here?  I've done the following:  * Added the new ""CaptureBirthdayIntent"" in the intents tab with three required slots ""year"", ""month"", ""day"". * Removed the ""HelloWorldIntent"" from the intent tab and removed the handler from the code. * Added the ""CaptureBirthdayIntent"" handler to the code (including replacing the hello world intent passed to \`addRequestHandlers\` with the capture birthday intent handler). * Updated the launch handler to reprompt for the birthday instead of exiting immediately. * Saved code, saved model, deployed code, deployed model, rinse repeat a couple times.  Here's my launch and capture birthday request handlers:  function isIntentRequest(handlerInput, intentName) {  return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === 'IntentRequest' &amp;&amp;  intentName === Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope);  }  &amp;#x200B;  function getRequestSlots(handlerInput) {  return handlerInput.requestEnvelope.intent.slots;  }  &amp;#x200B;  const CaptureBirthdayIntentHandler = {  canHandle(handlerInput) {  return isIntentRequest(handlerInput, 'CaptureBirthdayIntent');  },  handle(handlerInput) {  try {  const { year, month, day } = getRequestSlots(handlerInput);  const speakOutput = \`Thanks, I'll remember that you were born ${month} ${day} ${year}.\`    return handlerInput.responseBuilder.speak(speakOutput).getResponse();  }catch(error) {  return handlerInput.responseBuilder.speak(\`Error ${error.message}\`).getResponse();        }  }  }  &amp;#x200B;  const LaunchRequestHandler = {  canHandle(handlerInput) {  return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === 'LaunchRequest';  },  handle(handlerInput) {  const speakOutput = 'Hello! Welcome to Cake Time. When is your birthday?';  const repromptText = 'I was born Nov. 6th, 2014. When were you born?';  &amp;#x200B;  return handlerInput.responseBuilder  .speak(speakOutput)  .reprompt(repromptText)  .getResponse();  }  };  I was pretty hopeful that things would be smoother than last time I worked with Alexa, but now I'm just frustrated that I'm dumping time into debugging a basic hello world skill using Amazon's own tutorial. Are there any up-to-date working resources or tutorials for Alexa skill development?"
My Alexa is very slow to answer questions or play music.  Most of the time it won’t even play or will play for 5 minutes and stop.  I’ve unplugged it and left then plugged it back in countless times.  Anyone have any other ideas?  I’ve resorted to a **radio!**

"I host Happy Headlines on VolleyFM. It can be enabled to be attached to your daily briefing. I of course have it in my skills and two family members say that can't make it work, while the majority of family has had no issues.   &amp;#x200B;  I would really appreciate it if you could confirm my understanding...  I think all you need to say is... Alexa, enable Happy Headlines.    I have been told perhaps it is a carrier issue.. or maybe even location. Would really appreciate it. Being the family tech guy can be frustrating."
"When I sit at my computer to play games, I would like to turn off the music that is otherwise playing in the rest of the house (e.g., ""Alexa, play Simon &amp; Garfunkel Everywhere"").  Is there a way to do this?  Thanks!"
"You should always be able to access music hosted on a local Plex server, toggle locally controlled lights &amp; switches, pull live data from local devices, etc. regardless of internet connectivity.  Echo devices should also be able to communicate with each other via your LAN. If you have at least one Zigbee Echo, you should then have voice control at every single Echo device."
"Annoying. You have to choose a video that doesn’t have an ad at the beginning of the video if you want to include it in your routine and actually have it play. Annoying why doesn’t Alexa have a “click,ok” function so at least it plays the ad, then your video?"
Hey I have a first gen alexa and it disconnected when my internet went down for a sec and I’m trying to reconnect but the app does not detect it since it connects by connecting to the fake wifi thing the echo creates. Help?
"She can see the Echo and she used to be able to see the plugs, but one random day they disappeared. We have an Amazon Household and she is part of it. I am the 'owner.' She tried adding one of the plugs to her app, but it just deleted it from my app then. Amazon Chat doesn't have any light to shed on the issue. Any thoughts?"
"So I’m trying to go to sleep and usually I have her play white noise and usually it works fine, but tonight for some reason I asked her to play it and she said “I can’t do that, but there are other fun things we can do together, try saying Alexa open Amazon kids” I tried opening it once and she just said that same thing again, I’ve already turned her on and off, I asked her and she can tell jokes and my WiFi is fine so what’s going on?"
"This has only started the last 5 days.. I have one kasa coloured light in hall, which i call ""hallway one"" And the other hallway light is a hue plain white bulb, which i call ""hallway two"". Even if i delete the tp lik lights from alexa, and rediscover, its fine for short while, then it says ""there are more than one ""hallway two lights"".. And when i got back into the alexa app, sure as shit, there are 3 ""hallway two"" devices..WTAF is going on ?  All other lights in flat are hue bulbs, and not had any bother with them at all...  Any ideas lads, would be very much appreciated, as its driving me up the bloody wall ;("
"is there a set limit of routines you can have? like if you have too many does Alexa become sluggish? or slow to respond? , or would the app become slow too?"
"I have a routine set, where I can set my alarm in the alexa app and at the alarm time it will run my SmartThings scene of turning on my lights and start playing my wake up playlist on Amazon music through my sonos speakers.  I don't always wake up at the same time every day though. I would like to set that alarm by voice but so far I can only get it to just do an alarm through the echo dot."
"To clarify, I don't simply mean put alexa on my spare phone. I want to use it like an Echo device, and add it to my smart home room."
I brought an alexa to work since I'm mainly in my area by myself most of the time and I was playing an artist on shuffle.   I'm guessing one of my co-workers thought it would be funny to play ram ranch on spotify because when I had gotten back it was playing some rap playlist and ram ranch is known to be a troll song because it plays gay porn (I'm not joking) I'm guessing one of my co-workers was trying to get me in trouble and I wanna see who triggered it.   I know it's possible with google home by checking account history but is it possible with alexa?
"Hi all,   I just got an Amazon Echo for Christmas and recently set it up. I linked my Apple Music account, and set it as the default music provider. However, whenever I ask Alexa to play my music, she plays from the station “(my name’s) station that Apple creates, instead of from my library. Does anyone know how to change this or fix this issue?"
"My iOS app looks very different. I checked and it appears the last update was two weeks ago, but I’ve used it a lot since the update and never noticed it until today. Weird."
" I just thought it would be nice if we could use whisper in Custom. “ Alexa, whisper, “Goodnight” “ It’s weird they haven’t just let us use that in the first place."
"I don’t know why, but suddenly when I say ‘Alexa play Virgin Radio’ it now defaults to Virgin Radio Groove. No matter what I say it won’t play the standard Virgin Radio (I have tried ‘Virgin Radio UK’ ‘Virgin Radio Standard’ etc.) so the only way to make it play now is to use the Alexa app.  Any ideas? I have left feedback on the recent command section, but I don’t know how often they are checked!"
"I have Amazon Echo, Fire Stick 4K, and a Panasonic TV.  When I say:   Alexa, turn on Fire TV   - she uses the remote control to send an ""power toggle"" IR signal to my TV?  So, my remote has to be pointed at the TV for this to work.   Before, she used to turn on the Fire Stick 4K and that would trigger the Panasonic TV to power on.  Does anyone use Alexa to turn on your TV and how does it work for you?"
Just got an echo show and I want to be able to tell alexa to play a specific song and have her play similar music afterwards. I have Amazon music if that means anything. I just don't want her to turn off after she finishes one song
"I'm going to be gone for five months, but will have family occasionally coming into the house to do a walk-through, check for water, leaks, anything else, etc.  First, can I leave Guard enabled for that long reliably?  Does the app on my phone show me that Guard is working?  Can I turn Guard on and off from the app when I'm in another state?  Do I need to tell the family members to remember to tell Alexa when they come in and leave again?   I just got my Echo devices a couple of days ago and haven't had time to think this stuff through.

"Added a new Feit smart bulb to a room/group called Gallery. However when I tell her to turn on/off the lights in the Gallery it doesn't do anything to the new bulb. I've confirmed it is in the group. She will control the light if I name it directly, but that's rather tedious.  Any ideas?"

"Hi,  I've joined the ranks of digital nomads and moved to a small town, where I live on my own. I do a lot of running in the mountains and swimming in the ocean, and I'm not great with my phone. I don't want my friends and family to worry too much, so I was wondering whether there's a skill that will trigger Alexa to ask me to ""check-in"" every night at a specific time (almost like a dead man's switch?), and if I don't, it alerts a family member. That way, I could just let me people know that I'm fine if they don't hear from me - if there's trouble and I don't check in with Alexa, they'll get notified, and can then give me a call to check in.  Any advice?"
" Hi all. I have a single alarm set for 8am repeating every weekday. I don't have snooze or one tap snooze of anything of that like enabled.  When my 8am alarm went off today I said ""Alexa, stop."" And it did. At 8.04 it went off again, I said Alexa stop and it did. This repeated for  8.07  8.13  8.19  8.22   It stopped when I unplugged the damn thing  This isn't the first time it's happened and it is very frustrating.However ,it doesn't even happen everyday. Yesterday only my 8am went off and after "" Alexa stop"" that was the end of it.  I would think this is some kind of hidden snooze setting I've missed  but looking at the times it is completely random  Any ideas"
"Last night my friends Alexa started playing farting noises out of no where, then it stared mimicking a rat! We had to ask to cut it out- she then would start playing music by artists we didn’t request and turning the volume all the way up. At one point we had to scream at the top of our lungs to make her stop. Anyone else having these issues !?"
"I have SmartThings multipurpose sensors all over my home, including on every external door. These sensors currently read a temperature well below the actual temperature in the room they're in because the door they're on is cold from the outside air.  When I ask Alexa what the temperature in my home is, she takes these into account in her average, throwing off the figure wildly.  Is there any way to make her ignore the temperature data from specific devices?"
"Besides routines (looking for something that can be used with just voice), is there a way to have Alexa say ""a thing"" at ""a time?"" So far I'm only seeing Reminders, Alarms, Timers, and Routines; each of which have their annoyances and flaws.   Simple example... I'd like to say ""Alexa, let me know when it's 9pm"" and at 9pm, Alexa would say ""It's 9pm."" Currently, this would set an alarm, so at 9pm, instead of her say ""It's 9pm"" she says, ""BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP"" until I tell her to ""STOOOPPPPP.""   Reminders for this are annoying because they're logged by the app and need to be completed or dismissed (I don't need to check off that I have ""done a 9pm"") along with the double-repeat and the ""Here's your reminder..."" preface.   I could set up a routine in my phone to say a custom text string at a specific time (hell of a thing to do for a quick off-the-cuff notification and kind of defeats the concept of a voice assistant).   I tried the voice command ""Alexa, at 9pm, tell me it's 9pm"" and she still is like ""Okay, Alarm set for 9pm."" -\_-   I tried ""Alexa, at 9pm, say the phrase, it's 9pm"" and she just kinda shuts-off mid command or says ""Sorry, I don't know that.""   Any ideas?"

"Hi everyone, hope that you all are well and safe...  I am trying to get a command, for example: that when I say Alexa and my name, Alexa will automatically call me... This is to set it up at my mother's house, she is not computer savvy, and this is just in case of emergency that you can't think too much, just say Alexa Cesar and it will automatically call me... My mother is not very good with English, she had fall sometimes, even though she had the lifeline, there are sometimes that she took it off for any type of reason and when that happens she is in there until someone gets there, I call her or she stand up but with lots and lots effort!!!  Even using IFTTT, please any ideas will be greatly appreciated... And this won't be just for my mother, I work with lots of patience that will benefit for this.  Just in case I also have Google...

"I am setting up an Echo Dot V4 for a friend. I have it on his Alexa account, but for now it's on my wifi as I test and learn.

"I've had Sonos for over a decade.  Started with a Play:5.  Decent enough.  Definitely not audiophile and doesn't compare to my B&amp;W CDM 9NT speakers, nor do I expect it to, but I did hook a Sonos Connect up to that system for the better audio quality of those speakers.  I also eventually got some Play:1's, a Playbase, a Sub, and a Sonos One.  Sonos eventually rendered my old system incompatible with itself.  The older Play:5 and Connect are not compatible with the other newer speakers.  If I try to play through all of them on the legacy app, the sound keeps dropping out.  Their solution is to buy more of their stuff and junk my old perfectly working $500 Play:5 and both of my $350 Connects.  Yes.  That is over $1,000 in equipment they want me to junk.  Well, with the Echo, you can take the 1/8"" jack and output audio to any type of amp and speaker.  If the tech in the Echo becomes outdated, just get a new cheap Echo instead of throwing out $1,200 in equipment.  In fact, I had an old, but good quality 100W/channel studio power amp in a rack and some decent bookshelf speakers, just hooked an Echo up to them, and they sounds way better than the pair of Play:1's that were originally in the room... And it still would have been cheaper if I bought everything new instead of using stuff I had lying around.  Granted, the audio quality of the Echo output isn't audiophile quality.  However, if you pair it with a better speaker, it will sound better in many respects than any of the Sonos speakers.  Also, if you want better quality audio, just get the Echo Link.  Best of all, you won't be forced to throw out a perfectly good amp and speaker when Sonos decides to render the streaming portion obsolete."

"Hey everyone, to provide a little context, I'm helping a disabled individual troubleshoot an Amazon Alexa in their assisted living facility, so I have no physical access to the device. The individual was recently moved to a new room in the facility and is now experiencing some issues with their device. Originally, the Alexa will play podcasts, news, music (Prime Music + Spotify), etc. though at some point (usually around an hour or so later), will stop playing. So the user will request a song, podcast, news, etc., Alexa will respond saying ""Playing ... from Spotify"" (for example), but will not actually play anything. So a response is given, but nothing is actually played. Interestingly, the device WILL play jokes, weather, and even provide information from Wikipedia, but no songs, podcasts, or news. The only way to get the echo to continue playing media is to unplug the device, and plug it back in. But the issue usually re-occurs within an hour.   Some example scenarios:  1. Ask for the Weather: Alexa will return the current weather 2. Ask for Every Breath You Take by the Police: Alexa will return ""Playing Every Breath You Take on (person's) Spotify"", but nothing actually plays 3. Ask for a Joke: Alexa says a joke  The users device is registered to my Amazon account, so I went into the Alexa app and saw an option to continue playing the last thing the user had been listening to. It acts like it is then playing, but it then stops and I get a weird loading prompt, etc. and the user never actually hears anything playing.  The only thing I can think of is potentially a weak WiFi signal in the users new room. That being said, I'm surprised it will respond and play certain commands, and not others. Does this behavior make sense in the case of a weak WiFi signal? Any other things that we should try? I have confirmed that the device is up-to-date, and all skills are also on the latest version.   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!"
"Basically my aunt wants to be able to call my Alexa when dinner is ready. There is one in the living and one in my room.

"This is a minor bugbear but I wonder if anyone else experiences it.  On my Samsung Q90T, when the TV is off and I say turn it on, it turns on. I then say to turn it off, it turns it off. Great.  But this is just by coincidence if it was already in the opposite state to begin with. If it's off and I say turn it off, it will turn it on, and if it's on and I say turn it on, it will turn it off.  This messes with all sorts of routines eg where I want to turn everything off before I leave - if the TV is already off, it will switch on again. So I basically need to exclude TV from any group commands.  Does anyone else experience this? Any workarounds?"
"I've had a daily reminder at 10am for easily the past year, to remind me to do something.  It has always worked the same way, at 10am she says ""This is a reminder:  Do the thing..."" and she says it twice, and shuts up.  Recently (like the last week or two at most), this has changed.  Now at 10am every day an alarm just starts ringing, and seems to ring forever until I shut it up (maybe it would stop if I waited longer, I don't know).  What happened to change this?  I've checked and I have no alarms set, the reminder appears to be set correctly, I see nothing wrong anywhere and no setting that seems it would impact this."

"I've noticed lately that alexa is slow to respond . This has been since the last 3 or 4 days maybe? Before that it was perfect response on time. Now when I call her to turn something on or off it goes off first and then 3 seconds later the ok is said ,or when I turn something on it turns on and the ok is again delayed ,at times when I turn the lights off most of them go off but one or two are still on.also sometimes the blue light spins and nothing happens . This has been recent the echo is only about 2 weeks old ,so is it defective ? Or is this a server related problem ? Is anyone else having these problems ? I've done the unplug and plug back in ,doesn't seem to do anything. Wondering if I should factory reset see if that does anything?"

Before you could only control timers from the speaker you set it on. Recently they have updated and you can now control any timer from any alexa in your home.  This is something I've wanted for ages to check on cooking timer from wherever I'm located.  Such a simple change but incredibly useful.  Just give uk guard and I'd be completely satisfied lol.  Btw uk screened Alexa's now also play netflix.
"Hi, for over a year I've had a YAS-109 soundbar (with built-in Alexa) and a TCL Roku TV. I did not have the Roku skill enabled.  I would say, ""Alexa, switch to TV"" and it would switch the soundbar to the TV input (as opposed to bluetooth, or some streaming source).  Yesterday I installed the Roku skill. I was happy that I could turn the TV on/off using it.  However that skill now seems to circumvent the input setting. So if I say, ""Alexa, switch to TV"" it turns on the Roku TV and switches to the Antenna.  I can't seem to make it direct the command to the soundbar (which is the actual alexa device). I've tried using the device name etc. When I use the device name (e.g. ""switch YAS to TV"") it says that it can't seem to do that on that device.   Anyone have any idea what I could try?"

"I'm trying to figure out whether this is an Alexa problem or a Hue problem. I have 2 of each (Alexa Echo Show 8 and Studio &amp; Hue Bulb and Hue LED strip).   Last night, the lights became unresponsive to commands through Alexa. When i was fixing them today, there was a software update required for both lights. So i ran the update and reconnected the lights successfully.  However, there are now 2 issues that I haven't been able to figure out:  1) Lights no longer change smoothly. They no longer ease into the requested color gradually. They just switch from one color to another instantly. But they still turn on and off smoothly.  2) Color 'blue' has become very light. Two nights ago, i would say 'Alexa, make the light blue' and would get a nice, deep blue color. Now, it's sky blue. The commands 'dark blue' and 'navy blue' both give the same light blue color.  The only thing different about the setup now is, when I check each light's settings through the Alexa app on my phone, it says 'Connected via Studio'. Whereas initially, i did the setup through Echo. So i tried unplugging Studio and reconnecting the lights through Echo and for whatever reason, Echo wasn't able to find them. When i plugged Studio back in, the lights were found and i was able to successfully reconnect them to Alexa. So i guess Studio has become my 'primary' Alexa device or something? I haven't yet gone through the trouble of deregistering Studio from my Alexa profile to see if that would help Echo find the lights and fix the 2 issues described above. That's a pain in the ass that i'm saving for later if i can't figure this out.  Has anyone experienced this recently? Could this really be a 'connected via Studio' vs 'connected via Echo' issue? Or did the latest Hue software update mess something up? I have no idea."

"Alexa gets confused whenever I set the thermostat to eco.  She use to accept commands to turn eco back to either heat or cool.

I have already migrated Nest to it's google account and yet once I give the voice command to set the thermostat to eco, it looses the voice ability it previously had to set the house back to heat and cool.  Am I missing a command to get around this or do Nest and Alexa keep working on the back end and this is the result of two companies not syncing their work up correctly?"

Almost every time I go to play spotify (from the app) to one of my alexas I find the device doesn’t show up. I get around this by following the steps below:  1. Ask alexa who’s profile I’m in 2. If profile isn’t mine, switch to mine 3. Play spotify song on my phone 4. Ask Alexa device to play spotify.   I get quite frustrated too about asking alexa to play spotify and it chooses my other half’s spotify to stream from (cutting her from listening on her headphones).   I’m sure there’s a quicker and better way of having the speakers *always* show on the spotify app and/or alexa to only ever play from my spotify if it’s my voice. Is there any tips people have for better (or more seamless) spotify/alexa integration?  Interestingly too, I have made speaker groups in my alexa app (downstairs, upstairs, all rooms, etc) but my other half can’t steam to them either by voice, alexa app, or via spotify. It says those groups don’t exist. I can stream somewhat okay although it occasionally bugs out and stops playing in some rooms."
"I'm trying to find out if there is anything currently where I would be able to write a literal if then statement. I've been looking into skills and and IFTTT but I'm not able to find how to accomplish what I have in mind.  Basically I want to say ""alexa, I have to work at 730"" and have it set 3 alarms at specific times before 730. My shift changes daily so I want it to be somewhat dynamic. 615, 620 and 630 as an example. But all based on when I have to be to work.  It's not going to be super useful for everyone so I was going to write it myself but I don't know where to start, what language I'm supposed to do it in and so on. Any help would be useful."
Any GOOD led stripes that work with Alexa?
"Trying to play music tonight on my Alexa. For lack of a better description, it keeps stuttering any music I try to listen to and/or Alexa chiming in saying “Having trouble understanding right now”, when literally it’s completely silent in the room.  Anyway to reset it or do something to solve this problem?"
"""Set house to heat, cool, eco, off"" were all things I could say before.  But as of today (even after I begrudgingly migrating my nest account to Google) she still refuses to obey.  If I ask to her to change a mode or set the temp she responds with the following:  ""Living room is in a mode that doesn't accept requests. Be change its mode on the app or device.""  I should note I grouped the thermostat into the living room.  Is there a way to remove it?  The strange part is she sometimes accepts my command ""Set house to eco"". It's frustrating how inconsistent she's being."
"I have hunches and shopping notifs off, as well as having brief mode enabled but occasionally when I ask Alexa a question she says the answer and then adds some questions at the end like ""Do you want to hear about these gifts that will surely make someone happy?"". Is there any way to disable this?"
"I live in an apartment where I have no control over the heat.  I want to say something like ""Alexa, what's the temperature in the apartment"" and have her report the indoor temperature.  Is there a sensor that is simple and cheap that will do this?  Something y'all would recommend?"
"For example, 'Alexa define usual'   Alexa: ""Usual is usually defined as something that is usual.""  Who writes this stuff?? How on earth would a non-native speaker get anything from this, using the very word in question twice define that word? What's the worst you've heard?"
I had a routine set on one of my buttons. Now it flashes blue and then red after pressing. Have tried removing and replacing batteries but won’t pair. Any ideas ? TIA
One of my echo dots responded with “that command cant be used in this room” and proceeded to talk about a vicious spider and what did I want to do.  After a couple of attempts to get it to execute a command and hearing the same response I said kill the spider...the voice changed to what sounded like a male voice saying that was a bad idea as the spider was venemous and some other stuff...I unplugged the power cord from the echo and after it rebooted it has been fine.  What the heck happened?  Was this a hack?
I have 5 Echo Dots throughout our house and yesterday I turned on brief mode and it is working on 3 of the 5. The 2 that are still saying “OK” with a command are in my daughters rooms and are free time enabled but so are 2 of the others that brief mode works on. Anyone know if there is an extra setting I am missing? All devices are registered to me under my Amazon account.
"Be gentle. I'm new to Alexa and just finished setting up my first routine. I scheduled a light to turn on at sunset and off at midnight (2 separate routines). Next I added audio voice to say ""light on"" or ""light off"" with the routines. That worked too, neat.  I was listening to some music on the HD show as the sun was setting and it turned the light on but didn't interrupt or lower the volume of the song playing at that time to say ""light on"". Is that normal?"
"I just got my first smart plug on sale for $15.99 on Amazon.  I've always wanted to try one out and I thought that was a more then reasonable price to do so.  Now I need at least 4 more, but they are no longer on sale and cost $34.99 each.    So my question is this:  Do they go one sale once in awhile, or did I just the introductory price so that I get hooked on the product (it worked) and now I have to pay full price to get more of them?  I've been keeping an eye on them ever since and they don't seem to be going back on sale?  I don't want to pay full price, and I don't want the dupes, I want the real deal."
"I have a playlist titled BBQ.  When I tell her to shuffle my playlist ""barbeque"".  She responds - I don't see the playlist ""barbeque"" in playlist library.   So I try - Alexa, shuffle my playlist ""b-b-q"", then she says - shuffling your playlist ""barbeque"" on Amazon Music.  WTF, Alexa! Do you understand ""BBQ"" being an abbreviation of ""barbeque"" or not?"
Every time is try to shuffle a playlist on Apple Music it just says “i can't turn shuffle on for this stream” Does anyone have a fix for this? It just started happening tonight.
"If Alexa is playing a podcast, how can I tell her to mark it as played (without having to wait until the end of the episode)?"
Alexa refuses to play local or international news. Goodbye Alexa
"I never set reminders any more because every single echo in my home says it, which is profoundly annoying, especially single my living room has four echos in it.  I just want to have a reminder read out by one specific echo."
"I recently bought an secondhand Alexa echo dot 2.  I did a factory reset and tried to pair the app with the Alexa. But no matter what I do my phone won’t find the Alexa. I did it with an other phone too and it didn’t worked as well. I redownloaded the app and watched several videos, but couldn’t find anything about this. Is the model just too old?"
"I am not in anyway, shape or form trying to make this political but when asking who is the current president of United States, Alexa answers Joe Biden"
"I had another name in my Alexa account so I deleted it.  &amp;#x200B;  Now it won't recognize my voice, I'm trying to reconnect to my account, I the first time I tried it gave the instructions but for some reason wouldn't connect to the Wi-Fi, now the Alexa app wouldn't give me the prompt to set up again.   Is there a trick the Alexa app to start the setup again, with an existing Alexa account?"
"I've just started using Google Calendar for Time Blocking my day, and I've integrated ToDo-ist with it so that my To-Do items show up ON the calendar.   When I ask Alexa ""What's on my calendar?"" (basically asking, at any given time of day, ""What should I be doing right now \[according to my Time Blocking\]?""), she'll read out the To-Do items instead of the ""Events"" from the Time Blocking calendar. Sometimes my To-Do items will have long titles and, for some reason too, she'll start reading out some kind of ""http..."" (etc.)   Is there a way for her to read ONLY from my Time Blocking calendar and not read out my ToDo-ist tasks, which are in a different calendar? Or can she only read anything and everything across all calendars?  (I'm relatively new to Alexa in general and have only had ""her"" for about a week and a half now.)"
"I’ve just had yet another instance of asking Siri on my iPhone to set a timer. A few minutes later I asked how much longer it had to run, and Siri cheerfully brought up the timer still set at 15 minutes, having not started it running.   Does anyone else have multiple Apple products and services but also uses Alexa/Google speakers around the house? I have lists and notes with Apple that I’d want to add things to with voice commands (since Siri loves to misspell or even forget that I added something to my shopping list through the HomePod) but I’m not sure I can do that with anything other than an Apple device.   I love the privacy features of Apple and that’s why I’m still here, but bloody hell I’d trade my bank account number for Siri to fucking listen for once."
"If yes, please suggest steps that work. I tried and it did not."
"[The problem](http://i.imgur.com/CkMusJv.Jpg)  So yesterday I set up my new echo dot 4th gen and everything was working fine. I have an alexa household so I have one in every room as needed.   Everything was working fine and Spotify was recognising everything as it should. I was able to play music directly from my phone to the gen 4, to my gen 1, and to my show 8 without any issue.   I was listening to some music before bed and my wife plugged her phone in to charge, the music stopped and I was unable to connect anymore.  I feel like I've tried everything. I've factory reset the gen 4, I've disconnected my Spotify account, I've uninstalled Spotify, I've rebooted my WiFi I've done the lot!  Nothing seems to work.  It's important to note that the gen 4 is the only one I have trouble with, I can connect to all the others without any issue. Also the gen 4 is recognised because if I hit play everywhere on Spotify it still plays on the gen 4 too!   Please if anyone can help I am willing to try anything and to answer any questions!  Thank you"
"I understand the concept :). I don't get, however, how Alexa decides what is a Plug and what is a Switch. For example, i have two outdoor rated outlets, different brands, and one shows as a Plug and one as a Switch. Same for the indoor ones.  Is there any logic to how Alexa decides? One category would suffice IMHO."
"Is it not possible to create a routine using a smart device as a trigger? Like “if the living room lights turn on at night, do X,” for example?  I’ve never been able to select a smart home device as a “when this happens” despite having 25+ devices in the Device section of the app."
"I am in the process of putting echo dots in all our rooms (we have 3 but looking to buy more).  We will be getting the Spotify family plan.  From what I read, you can only associate 1 Spotify account to one Amazon account.  I would prefer not to do multiple Amazon accounts, so I am wondering if I could use a older iPhone for each room and Bluetooth to the echo dot as a work around.  Anyone with experience on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!  PS. If someone has a better solution or alternate way to solve this, I’m open to suggestions."
" So I recently purchased Gosund smart bulbs, a couple smart plugs, and a Amazon echo dot (4th gen). I’m having extreme amount of trouble getting Alexa to turn on my lights simultaneously. I have a light fixture that I screwed two bulbs into. They both work perfectly within the Alexa app and the smart life app, I can simultaneously change the color, brightness, and all that stuff IN the app. The trouble is that when I say Alexa “turn on/off the bedroom lights” it only does it for one of the two bulbs!!! Both bulbs are in a group in the Alexa app and the smart life app. I have tried everything I can think of (scouring google) and I cannot find a solution. Anyone have any ideas? I really want to be able to use Alexa to turn my lights on simultaneously instead of just one."
"Hey there, alexa community  Long story short, would anyone know how it could find another ribbon cable that's used in the 3rd gen echo dot?  Following a tear down article I read, I figured out it should be a 39 pin FFC cable, but I can't find one for the life of me on the Internet.  Has anyone by chance already tried tinkering with a gen3 dot and knows what kind of cable is used there and where to get one, preferably longer than the original one.  Or maybe there are other devices out there that have a compatible cable built in that I could get and strip down.  Appreciate the help, have a wonderful evening."
"This is driving me crazy. I used to be able to say, “turn on the bedroom light” (Hue) or “what is the temperature in the bedroom?” (Ecobee) but now she always says there’s more than one device with that name. WTF is she talking about?!"
Its really infuriating that you can not set a password to your alexa. I stay with multiple people in my house as many Echo Dot users will do. I have 3 smart lights and ofcourse echo dot its self is a speaker. The fact that you cant use a password to protect these is really sad. People can just walk in to my room when I am not around and mess with it. Now I know you can put a password to the purchases. But if I am listening to music I dont want ot to be intrupped cuz they are playing music at home. Wouldn't it be really nice if they had a password protection controlled either by voice or from the app. You would have to unlocky the Echo Dot before giving it commands. Because at the end it is a personaly device. I think this feature needs to be intigrated ASAP. Also people use Alexas and Echo Devices to lock their front doors now albeit i dont know if those lock door devices have password protection with them but nontheless the Echo Dot and Alexa should have a protection too. A robber could just tell alexa to unlock front doors if you leave your window cracked. Or even worse https://youtu.be/ozIKwGt38LQ / https://youtu.be/OQHJhUVJGeo. Maybe those r far from reality right now but it is a possibility. I really would like this thread to draw some attention so we can get to someone from Amazon.
"Once, I asked my Echo Dot what's 1 googol minus one, and she started to sound like that video of Siri having a stroke. Now, when I ask, she stops herself after one second. Do you think Amazon blocked it or is it just my account that causes this. After all, it's really funny hearing her run out of breath."
"It's already a little annoying that every few days she does the 'oh, by the way, I have this other command you should try' but now she's like 'hey I wrote a song for the SUPER BOWL THAT IS COMING UP, want to hear it?'. No, Alexa, I just wanted you to turn my light on in my hallway..."
"Did this feature disappear?  I spent 15 minutes looking and cannot find how to change balance. I can SWITCH channels (left/right) and unpair, but balance is gone.  I last changed it about a month ago."
"I want to initiate a morning routine when I dismiss the alarm on our bedroom echo dot.  Going through the alexa app, getting one of the FireTVs to turn on the news and turning on lights downstairs was pretty straightforward but I'd also like the kitchen echo to tune to our local NPR affiliate.  When I try to do it in the app it seems to only want to allow it on the device that initiated the routine (bedroom dot)-can this not be done or am I missing something?"
"I don't ever want alexa to play anything on my tv. Least of all my ecco dot.  So when I say "" alexa, plan rocket ship run"" (a song my child likes). Alexa hears it wrong, or just grabs the wrong info, says playing rocket ship run dance remix, stops whatever the tv in the living room is doing, and plays a music video. How do I stop them from talking to each other. Ideally I'd rather ecco dot not talk to anything outside of wifi.   I thought I've turned off anything that looks related, but the app doesn't seem very straightforward. Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Cheers"
"My Echo Show is online and connected to the same wi-fi network; however, it is not detected when scanning for speakers in multi-room settings. Is there any way to resolve this dilemma?"
"Hi folks. I was curious. If i wanted to buy and use Amazon Echo Dots for ***only*** Alexa Guard, specifically for window glass breaking events, is that possible? I did not want Alexa to be listening for ""Hey Alexa"" or other non-Guard related commands. Thank you"
"My biggest pet peeve with this thing is I can’t turn of ALL motivations. In the app I have turned off everything under More / Settings / Notifications  But it’s keeps going off for low batteries on my Blink cams or weather alerts and I don’t see an off for these?  The reason I’m complaining is that we have one in my kids room and it randomly has to blink yellow, when I do t want ANY notifications.   Can I disable all notifications somewhere??"
"She received an Echo Dot with Smart Plug for Christmas, which she wanted. We started to set it up yesterday but are unsure of the best path forward, it's confusing. She wants a level of independence, mostly with regard to Alexa playing her Spotify account and not mine when requesting music. She doesn't have an Amazon account presently.  Is there an advantage one way over the other?"
"I just discovered that if you have Amazon Music, there is a button that allows you to play whatever song on Echo devices or groups.   I don't know if this is well known or not, so thought I'd bring it up.   It's handy for songs that Alexa doesn't understand when you speak to her.  Also, if you connect to a group of speakers, you can use your phone volume buttons to change the volume up or down on the whole group.  It might be a well known fact already, but it's made me quite happy!"
"I've set up a routine called Breakfast Time, which when I trigger Alexa with this routine, will turn on the kitchen lights and the set my morning radio station to play via TuneIn.  This all works nicely, the problem I have is I would like, when I've finished breakfast to end the routine. Is there a way to get a routine to stop?  If not, is there a way to include in a routine a way to turn off Tune In or other music actions?   TLDR: I can find routines to turn on music but not turn it off."
"My brother gave us  3 echo dots for Christmas  And we're trying to get at least 2 talk to each other.   Already enabled drop in my device .  Also,  I'm trying to add a contact by can't find the other echo dots in the devices area."
"Hey guys, I’ve had all of my rooms set up with hue lights for years without any issues, but lately my “Alexa, turn on Library lights” command will only turn on one of the three hue bulb lamps in that room.  If I go into the Hue app, they’re all linked as a room, and the same in HomeKit. Even when I go into the Alexa app I can go to devices and to lights and find the room toggle for “Library” and when I tap it, it will activate and deactivate all three lamps. But boy with voice command.  Anyone have any insight?"
"I’d like my Bose speakers on my tv to be added into everywhere, so music is  truly playing everywhere rather than just on my Alexa dots.   Is this possible? Or do they all need to be an Amazon speaker?   Thanks!"
"I know this is impossible but it's very frustrating that I have an Echo show in the same room as my Echo Dots.  I have the echo Dots strictly for the stereo sound for music. But so they don't get confused with the Echo Show I mute them. That means my decorative Echo Dot speakers always glow red which kind of makes them look like something is broken! (Also, one glows much brighter than the other for some reason).    I know I can change the name of them but they still activate as I actually use different names for my different echo devices in different rooms. Anyway, it's just frustrating!   It's also disanointing that I can only play Alexa Music options through my multi speaker setup. I want to get an Echo Sub but in order to really enjoy all my sources of music it means I have to have two separate speaker setups! So I think I need to draw the line at investing more into the setup.   Are there options for 3rd party speakers that will fit into the Echo network and allow me the best of both worlds? I.e., a good stereo speaker set up for my own music and for Alexa music?   Meanwhile a little trick I found was to add a UE Megablast via Bluetooth to an old Echo Dot, and I essentially us that as a sub woofer in the same room.  It's pretty cool in that the timing to the Bluetooth is ever so slightly off and it really adds that spatial effect to the speaker set up.  But, that micro delay is not controllable, so the effect seems to fade in and out randomly. Its cool, but not ideal."
"On the phone app for Alexa I'm trying to pair a new device. My Wifi network is hidden so I have to enter it manually. All good so far but then what? On the wifi info page there is no enter button or done button. The echo dot I use to talk to alexa is already on this network so Alexa should be able to resolve this (sigh) but alright, how do you add the hidden network so Alexa can see the new device?  I have also tried to talk to alexa to do this. And the new device is in paring mode and only feet from both the router and Alexa.  Why is this so poorly implemented?"
"They have to fit into a ceiling fan with a dome, so if anyone has any suggestions please let me know."
I have my reminders set to announce from all devices. Problem is they don't announce in sync. It sounds like an echo chamber as each device if off by up to a second.  This does not happen when I play music 'everywhere'.  Is there a setting somewhere?
"I have used Alexa and Smartthings and a bunch of other smart device apps for a long time. I don't know if I made a change that I can't remember or something else happened, but in the last few weeks I constantly get duplicate devices. Anything that is already connected through Smartthings shows up a second time - the details show ""connected via ZWaveManufacturer"". These also only show up in ""all Devices' but not under lights, switches, plugs - they all have an icon of a little house with a wifi signal in it. I keep deleting them but they come back... How do I stop them from messing up my list of devices?"

"Hi All -  I get the overall “gist” of Zigbee. I have a smart home now with tons of devices including Hue lights, Ring Security, Outdoor Cameras, Smart Plugs, and tons of other items and I’ve never needed a “hub” outside of the Hue hub for the lights and the Ring hub for my various security items.   I’m debating getting an Echo 4 for my kitchen. I got one for my mom for Christmas and the sound made me jealous compared to my Echo 3rd gen. My question is - will Zigbee protocol override the hubs on my hue system and ring system? I prefer the clean hubs supplied by the manufacturers and hope they Zigbee hub doesn’t override that or do double work for the same result.   For example when I say, “Alexa, turn family room lights on”....will that trigger Zigbee or will it trigger the Hue hub as it does now...or will it trigger both and there would be some sort of overlap?  My point is I really could care less about Zigbee as I’ve never needed it with my other hubs supplied by the manufacturers. I just don’t want the built in Zigbee hub to mess with my current system."
"Hi everyone, I'm looking for advice on how to possibly create a way to use a voice command or button that would trigger alexa to enable or disable a routine.  The routine in question is to detect if someone opens a door or window at night, I want it to turn on the house lights.

"Hey guys,  As the title says, I'm trying to make routines with Alexa to create alarms for my shifts.  Has anyone succeeded in doing stuff like this?  I have 3 shifts, 5am, 3pm, 10pm, is there any way to create alarms with routines and make it so it doesn't ring all alarms? (e.g if I enable the 3pm shift it won't wake me at 5am)  Thanks"
"Is there a skill that basically allows you to create your own streaming station to play to your and other's alexa devices via amazon's servers, so for example you could use multi-room music with the live output of your computer audio?

"I have several Amazon devices which include Fire tablets for my 4, year old twin daughters. I had issues with having to change settings on both tablets, so I ended up putting them under the same profile. One and done; easy peasy. But now my Echo devices will only play the audible library of the shared profile my girls have. I don’t know how this is even possible since neither of them have an audible account or the app on their fire tablets. I’m guessing it’s included in the free time subscription but I have never played, added, or even seen any content for their profile. Just now, my Echo Dot said it would pick up where it left off from, “Pinocchio”, and when I asked to play PinkFancyCrane’s library instead, it said it could not do that. I went onto the Alexa app to see if I could change this in settings but I didn’t see anything about connecting specific devices two specific profiles. I would really appreciate any help; it’s a minor inconvenience but I missed using my device to listen to my books"
"Just bought a couple of Feit smart bulbs, and I can use them effectively when creating a routine.  The only thing is - I don't get the option to use the effects that can be programmed with the bulb.  If I go in the the Feit app, I can have the bulbs strobe/flash different colors, but when I go to set up a routine, I only get power/brightness/color selection.  This is my first batch of smart bulbs that I've dealt with, and was wondering if there was another way to incorporate the bulb effects into the routine.  Are the effects only available through the Feit app, or does Alexa not support bulb effects?"

"My phone wasn't charging, so to set an alarm for work tomorrow I thought it would be a good idea to use Alexa. I've had an echo, so I know whispering will start quiet mode. However, I guess the older editions do not have the said feature, and at full volume said  ""ok! I have an alarm set for 7 hours and 29 minutes from now. That will be at 8 Am! Would you like me to set that for each weekday?"", waking everyone in our apartment...

Is there a way to use my sound bar and a Bluetooth speaker simultaneously with Alexa?
I've only just started using our Echo Show having never really had a need for it before - at the moment it's on a bedside table following the death of an old clock radio. I've set a routine for it to switch on and play a radio station at 6.45am daily but only want it to play for an hour. Probably a really simple question but how do I set it to turn off automatically? Thanks for any help.

"I have an amazon account shared with my parents. I'm set up as an adult account and they are set up as an adult account. We both started using alexa recently and trying to figure out how to separate everything in alexa. Searching for help has been no help.  It appears Alexa has a main list called Shopping list. When we say add \_\_\_ to my shopping list, or if my parents say the same phrase, it goes to the same list. Does anybody know away to separate out the accounts so we both have separate shopping lists? I know we can each create a list using different list titles. Just wondering if it's possible for us to both have our own ""shopping"" list."

"Hi, we bought Echo dots for each room of our home to help with ADHD family members, etc. however, I’m noticing some things that I’m hoping I can get help figuring out.  1. When I ask Echo to stop playing the music that’s playing in one room, it turns off the music in other rooms. So I need to verbally say blu to turn off or stop playing music on x device (say it’s specific device name?)  2. How can I get different calendars to announce on different devices? Ex. I’d like my calendar to continue announcing from the kitchen and my daughter’s calendar to announce on the one in her room.  3.

Calendar events at repeating twice when announced, anyway to adjust this setting?"
"I have an Echo Show in my kitchen, a Dot in my living room and a Flex in the bathroom. All these rooms are connected. I talk the most to the show but lately, it stops listening while I'm talking to it. Also, instead of responding from the Show, the Dot or the Flex responds. I have NO clue how to fix this!"
"Sooo, at 2:11 am last night Alexa started reading something and woke up my wife and me. We told it to turn off. There is record of us telling it to turn off in the app but no record of what it was doing. Is there somewhere else I can look? Does this happen to anyone else?"
"I recently was given an echo show, I didn't know much about it and still having trouble finding it remotely helpful in my setup.  One of actually useful things I found that it would do is if I asked it to play a song, it would bounce the lyrics through on the screen. I really like that feature but it cuts off after about 30 seconds into the song, which is useless. I've tried changing settings but it still does this.  Is there anyway to make it actually keep playing lyrics for the whole song instead of going to the useless clock and background pictures?"
Alexa’s ‘Tell Me When’ skill combines [reminders](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221443/amazon-alexa-new-reminder-skill-tell-me-when) with contextual information
"Hello, never knew that Alexa was available on PC, so that was new today and it really helps me out so I'm psyched. However I quickly noticed that my voice activated routines are firing. Anyone experience this? Example I say Alexa do this and it beeps like it's doing it, then nothing."
"I mean, I can use my phone to control spotify when my Echo dot is playing music, is there any way to do the same?"
Can I talk to my parents' echo in the UK from my echo in France for free?
Is there any possible way to make my Echo and Samsung TV/ Soundbar (both Alexa compatible) to link together to play music from Spotify at the same time.   I have open plan kitchen/living room and would like the multi room effect with music being played from my sound bar and echo at the same time.   I have tried through airplay and Bluetooth at the same time from my phone but it will always cut one off- anyway around this??
"I have Alexa, google nest, haiku L big ass fans ceiling fan, SmartThings, and can’t for the life of me figure out how to make the ceiling fan turn on for 20 minutes whenever the nest heater kicks on.   I can’t pick the nest when creating an Alexa routine. Google home app doesn’t let me make a routine based on the nest status. SmartThings sees my nest now, but not my haiku fan.   Ideas?"
"For years I had great success voice controlling directv through alexa. I moved homes and received a newer 4K genie box and have had no luck getting Alexa to control Directv. I did some research on the model number I have and I found many others have had this issue with that model.  I have an Alexa/harmony hub setup.  My question is, what which directv model numbers have you had success controlling with Alexa? Do you otherwise have any advice for remedying this issue? I’ve used this setup with many other devices in my house, so I’m not sure it’s user error... but I’ll take any advice. Thanks!"
"When I ask for the latest album or to shuffle a particular artist there are duplicates with clean and explicit versions.   Aside from creating a playlist and playing that, is there a way to forbid the clean versions?   Thanks!"
"It's a massive annoyance every time i play my book to hear alexa tell me how much time is in a chapter and how much is left in my book before playing the actual book.  Songs dont do this, if you want to know you ask, so why is it different with audio books?  Drives me nuts having to hear it 6-10 times a day."
"Hi,  Is not uncommon that I want to play music or something and maybe I'm home alone in quiet or maybe the dishwasher is running so I end up changing the volume 4 times in a row not knowing where I'm starting from.  So I made a routine so I can say ""alexa, volume check"" and she will speak all the odd number volumes ""this is volume one. This is volume three...."" Up to 9. Then I can decide easily which is appropriate at the time and set it.  Can you do more advanced routines where maybe it can know what the current volume setting is to go back to at the end instead of just ending at 9? Is there a variable like in Siri shortcuts perhaps? Or tell her to ask me after she speaks them which volume I prefer and wait for my answer?"
"I have an older fire stick. It's not the 4k one with power and volume buttons. One day my Alexa app magically informed me that it found a TV device. It's plugged into the TV, but the TV isn't smart or attached to a smart plug so it found the TV through CEC. Then I could tell the echo to turn my TV on and off. I switched accounts recently and it's not allowing that anymore. How do I get it to work again? All Google searches lead to results for the one that is programmable so I'm frustrated trying to figure out how it works."
Does anyone know why an echo show 5 can’t be added to a home theatre group with a fire tv?
"Alexa engineers must have decided that it is completely fine to bombard a user with tens of emails saying their sensors are running out of battery.  Is there a way to turn off this feature all together instead of going through device by device?   If there is anyone from Amazon here, please do UX studies on your decisions."
"I’ve had about 5 alexa’s for a couple years now with no big issues. However lately a few of them “can’t find” certain hue light groups around my place.   It seems like the units are semi connecting to my other household (my families Amazon account is linked with mine for prime sharing)  I know it’s not the lights themselves or the network as other alexa’s work just fine controlling those same lights.  Problem is I just can’t seem to find the setting to fix this issue. The address, the location, the WiFi network and the account are all mine yet this problem keeps happening.  I’ve even tried a clean factory default on the units and it still did not fix the issue. Any ideas what’s going on?"
How can I shorten or disable a response form Alexa device that is so verbose and annoying. “sorry I’m having trouble completing your request. I am having trouble connecting to the Internet. if you continue having this problem contact support”.   I know it’s due to issues of lost connection or dropped WiFi and support can’t do anything.   What can I do to stop or shorten such response. 😡
"I am wondering if there is a way to get Alexa to remember and keep track of numbers for me.  I know Alexa can remember things that I tell it to remember but that is not what I am looking for.   I want Alexa to keep track of how many times I did something (e.g. reps of an exercise).  I see that there is a skill called Daily Counter. This skill seems closest to what I am looking for but this skill resets the counter every day, and seems to keep track of only one thing.   Does anyone have any suggestion? Thank you."
Can anyone help me and explain why my Alexa devices have started switching on Meross plugs along with Phillips hue lightbulbs when I say turn on/ off bedroom lights. The plugs are definitely set as plugs and not lights. TIA
"Hey y'all, hoping I can get help in resolving a very infuriating situation. Let me go over the topography:  * I have 2 properties, let's call one *Garfield* and the other *Mark*. They are about 6 hours away from each other and before the Pandemic, I would spend part of the week in one and the rest of the week in the other.  * In *Garfield*, I have just an Echo Dot. In *Mark*, I have an Echo Dot, 2 x Echo Shows, and 2 x Echos.  * Each property has their own respective Hue Hubs to control Hue lights - i.e. one hub at *Garfield* and the other at *Mark*.  * For property *Garfield* with *Garfield_Hue_Hub*, I have Hue bulbs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 along with a Hue Dimmer Remote.  * For property *Mark* with *Mark_Hue_Hub*, I have Hue bulbs A, B, C, D, E, and F along with a Hue Dimmer Remote.  Table:  Property | Hue Hub | Bulbs | Accessories -|-|-|- *Garfield* | *Garfield_Hue_Hub* | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | Hue Dimmer Remote *Mark* | *Mark_Hue_Hub* | A, B, C, D, E, F | Hue Dimmer Remote   Note that until June 2020, I only had items in *Garfield*. It wasn't until July 2020 that I started outfitting *Mark* with Hue stuff.  This past weekend, I, for the first time in over 6 months, returned to my *Garfield* property to find my Hue lights weren't being recognized by Alexa.  I noticed Alexa group *Garfield_Room_1* had lights 1, 2, A, B. I edit the group and remove A and B and added bulbs 3-6. However, upon saving, bulbs 3-6 are not added. Instead, bulbs A-C are. I remove bulbs A-C and save. That just leaves bulbs 1 and 2 which is fine since those 2 are in the correct group, in the correct location. I go back in and add bulb 3, hitting ""Save"" and intending to add all *Garfield*-specific bulbs individually. Instead, Bulb A gets added. Repeat this multiple times until I get frustrated and unlink the skill and re-link it and run discovery. That seems to work and I'm able to add all *Garfield*-specific bulbs to the group and eventually control them.      Having returned to *Mark*, I am experiencing the exact same thing, except at this property! In *Mark_Room_1*, I have lights A, B, 2, 3, 4. Just like in *Garfield*, I removed lights 2, 3, and 4 and lights A and B remain, exactly as it should be. I go to add light C to the group, hit save, and light 2 is added. Repeat this multiple times with the same result - I am unable to add lights C-F as lights 2-6 get added whenever I save.      When I tell Alexa to ""turn on *Group*"" (in property *Mark* with *Group* having just light F), I am met with ""Sorry the hub that device *Group* connected to is not responding. please check its network connection and power supply."" However, I can turn on the individual light F.      Looking in Alexa's groups for the property (*Mark*), I don't see a group called ""Hallway"". So I create a ""Hallway"" group and add light F to it. Upon saving, Alexa is showing ""Hallway"" as having light 4. I just tried, now, to add light F to the ""Hallway"" group but only light 4 persists. She somehow thinks light 4 *is* light F.     **Regarding Hue**      Within the Hue app, I have 2 bridges with ""Out of home control"" enabled. I did read the little notice regarding ""Out of home control"", namely ""Note that per account you can only use one Hue Bridge"". I interpret this as you can only control one bridge at a time, which is on par with my experience.      I am incredibly frustrated. Can someone tell me what the hell I'm doing wrong? Note that I will be crossposting to /r/Hue to see if anyone over there has any ideas as well. This is incredibly frustrating and any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
"Does anyone know what happened to the Echo Flex? These things were awesome for around the home and were extremely affordable. Now they just show as currently unavailable. Is Amazon working on a 2nd pen, are they out of stock, or does anyone know what's up?  Much thanks,  khTEV"
"Alexa dropped some ""try this..."" while I was busy and didn't hear. Apparently you can tell her something and she plays your most requested songs of 20202....but I missed the actual phrase.  Anyone know?"
"So, I tried to chat with Amazon support today about an issue that I have seen others mention here.   Myze motion sensors tigger routines (lights) to come on as expected. But if you have a routine for “No motion for XX mins“ this will not work. If you remove the time constraint it works. So if I change it to “no motion detected” they will turn off. But this results in the lights turning off if you sit still for 15 seconds.   &amp;#x200B;  I have removed the routines, created new, unlinked the wyze skill and reenabled, ect.  &amp;#x200B;  Any ideas?"
"So I recently got an echo dot 3 and was pretty excited. But I can't do anything with it. Alexa doesn't find my smart devices, no matter how much I try, it doesn't detect them. I can't even play music due to geographical restrictions and I dont like the radio. It was also a pain in the ass to set it up due to my shit Wi-Fi. Returning it in the morning."
How do i make my alexa speal italian???
"Other than saying, “Alexa, stop!”  Sometimes I’ll ask her to play a song or album that’s only available with the music subscription and she’ll suggest and start playing a radio station instead. Very annoying and presumptuous."
Why would Alexa say hasta la vista baby at like 751am for no reason
"So I have a number of room groups within another group called “Downstairs”.  Alexa doesn’t recognise commands like “Alexa, turn the downstairs lights off” she just turns EVERYTHING off instead of just turning off the lights.  So unless I’m doing something wrong, groups within groups seems broken or not fit for purpose. Can anyone help me if I’m doing it wrong? Thanks"
So I bought Smart lights that work with the smart life app. Sometimes my bulbs work on the smart life app but are unresponsive in Alexa. Sometimes it just doesn't work on both. I'd have to manual turn the switch off then on but doesn't work 100% of the time. It gets annoying because my routines always work. Most of the time it's just one bulb that keeps doing this. Is there a fix?
"I have this skill as part of my ""good morning"" routine and I'm getting sick of it always being ""on this day *x* years ago."" Is there a different skill I can use that isn't always history? I was expecting this to be random facts and trivia about *anything*."
"I’ve tried:  -unplugging the old units -deregistering the old units and then reconnecting  -uninstalling Alexa app on phone and then reinstalling   I can request music play on the older gen dots from either my phone or using the 4th gen. Once the 3rd gen are playing music I can change the playlist, request a station play, etc, but once I say ‘stop’ I cannot request the music start again from a 3rd gen dot.   They can perform other internet functions, so it’s not a WiFi issue. Also checked WiFi and can see them on our network."
"Hello there! I just haved a quick question about my Alexa device, see, I connected my Echo Dot to my Xbox One and now every time I try to change the volume on my Alexa device it tries to change it on my Xbox but the device's volume would still be the same... Do I have to turn off my xbox everytime I want to change the volume on my Alexa?  Edit: not even when my xbox is off... When I tell Alexa to set volume she turns on my Xbox... I love to jave Alexa connected to my Xbox but if this is a problem that can't be fixed I rather have them both working separately"
"Have multiple sonos one set up around the house. Also have the ring professional monitoring.   Wondering when amazon/Alexa will enable integration of the sonos speakers to listen for glass break as part of guard mode. Does anyone know?  And if not, if I were to buy an echo dot and just disable the microphone (so Alexa only activates on the sonos), will it properly activate Guard mode?  Thanks"
"What. The. Hell. I always downplayed people saying that ""Alexa listens to your private conversations"" etc., etc., but now I am a believer and will keep every Alexa device I have unplugged until someone on here has a reasonable explanation.   &amp;#x200B;  I was going through old voicemails I had and saw a three-minute long voicemail sent to me on November 28th of 2020. I would upload a link to the voicemail to verify if it indeed was my Alexa that recorded me, but the conversations it recorded were so insanely private that I am very frightened that a hacker may have it and could send it to my family. I will try to explain the recording.  It consisted of conversations that I believe happened all in the same day, but not all together at once if that makes sense. one was about 40 seconds, and the next one was about 2 and a quarter minutes. Again, they were not recorded at the same time, the first conversation was earlier in the day, and the next was in the evening. In the first recording, I DID say ""Alexa, pair mode"" to play music from my phone, and 5 seconds later said ""Alexa, nevermind"". But that was 20 seconds after the recording started. in the 2 minutes long video, I did not say Alexa at all. Not sure if this helps but hopefully it's useful information to somebody on here. during the transition of the two clips, there were 3 weird ""clicks"", it kind of sounds like when you get transferred over on some automated phone calls for banks and stuff if that makes sense.    &amp;#x200B;  I don't know what to think. Does Alexa do this sometimes? Why is the phone number an ""unknown caller"" with no number whatsoever? I cannot call it back or anything. I am quite fearful of my privacy now. I hope some veteran Alexa users and techs have an explanation for this."
"I have several dots shows and a sub in a speaker group, if I wanted to hook up my guitar or something to a mixer and send that audio to the speaker group is there a device for that?"
"Hi, I have a bunch of routines to turn off and on various plugs and lights on a schedule.  Maybe 20 ish throughout the day in total. 2-4 everyday do not execute. Always random, always different.  Anyone experience anything like this?  Are there any logs anywhere that we can see ??   My only solution so far is to make double routines a few mins apart to decrease the chance of something failing twice.  This solution is tedious and ugly tho, as the routine list is already pretty  messy imo"
Two nights ago I added an action that told my wife goodnight with her name.   Last night I took it out of the routine.  This morning? She is freaked out.
We have a dot 3rd gen we play music on through Amazon unlimited music. We bought 2 more 4th gen echos and set them up on the same account.  When we ask it to play a song it says we need to upgrade our account for the 2 new ones. The old one still works.  What do I need to do to get music working on the 2 new echos?
My echo Flex was super deaf and in fact my third gen Echo dot in the other room was hearing me better than the echo flex in the same room!  Then I flipped the Flex upside down and put it in the top wall outlet rather than the bottom and now it hears me much better.   Wonder why this happened!  Maybe since it's close to the floor and the acoustics were weird? 🤷‍♂️
I have a music playlist I use to calm my parrot when he starts screaming. Is there a way for Alexa to recognize he is screeching and automatically start playing that specific playlist?
"Hey y'all, I'm trying to set up a routine where I shuffle a playlist and periodically have alexa say some words. I have it set up as such:  \- Trigger -   \- Shuffle playlist on Amazon Music -  \- Wait 20 seconds -  \- Say ""Keep it up.""  \- Wait 5 minutes  \- Say ""You're doing great, you got this.""  etc.  But based on the sequence I've created, she never says anything. If I change the order so that ""Shuffle playlist"" is at the bottom, she'll do everything, and then start the playlist. It looks like she won't interrupt the music to say anything (or speak over the music, which I'd actually prefer). Rather, she'll play the entire playlist, and then when it's over she'll wait 20 seconds, say things, wait, say things, etc.  Is there a way to get her to speak over the music?"
I can get one for cheap and it's the extended battery which lasts for over a day but I just can't figure out what to do with the damn thing. I already have bluetooth speakers which I can stream apple music and I get Alexa on my phone so.. does anybody have any ideas of what I could do with a battery pack that would allow my echo device to leave the house?
"I’ve searched and searched and cannot find this. Occasionally my 2nd generation Dots will make a chime, then begin a slow pale-green flash. I look at the app and can’t see anything, and I ask Alexa what’s happening and she doesn’t know. I thought maybe it means it’s on a call or drop-in, but when I ask her to “hang up” she says sorry no calls/drop-ins in progress and continues to pale-green flash."
"Title. I don't know if it's been discussed before but I couldn't find any specific reason on the internet. Why doesn't the 4th gen Echo Dot with the clock also come in black? Will it arrive at some point?  I was waiting for this new gen to finally put the Echo Dots in my bedroom and kitchen, but in that spots I need them to display the time and black is the only color that fits my home.  Any chance they're coming soon?"
"Hi!   Has anyone else had this issue? I have a new Echo 4, which sounds pretty good, most of the time. Sometimes she will sound very muffed when you speak to her, and Spotify will sound like it's playing but with no treble at all. Tell her to stop then start again and the music and voice is perfectly clear. I don't know if it's a defective unit or if other people have had the same issue."
I use my own alexa account to drop in with friends and not have it be sent to other family members devices but i use my families amazon music account. is there any way I can log out of my amazon music and switch it to my family’s on my alexa?
I’d like to warm up the house about an hour before my alarm goes off. I work an irregular shifts so I don’t want a weekly temperature schedule. I can’t figure out how. I can make a routine to change the temperature when dismiss an alarm but that’s not early enough to have a warm house when I get up. Any tips?
"So I got my grandpa an amazon echo 8 for Christmas so he could videochat with the family. He doesn't have any other smart devices so I had to set it up through my phone on the app. A family member is trying to call him on his Echo Show 8 and it's ringing on my phone, so now I'm afraid that maybe its only ringing on my phone and not on my grandpas echo, and I don't really have a way to check if both devices ring since I don't live near him. Anyone have any idea if it just rings for the both of us?"
"My Gosund plugs wont connect to my Alexas! Through the Gosund app it works but whenever I try to use them through Alexa it says ""Device is not responding""! I dont know what to do!! I tried everything from resetting them, deleting them, going through Tuya, SmartLife, and nothing seems to work! Could Gosund just be down??"
"Sorry if this has been asked already, I searched and couldn't find a post with the same issue.  I have 4 different Alexa devices; a tap, a gen 2 or 3 echo dot, one of the taller echo's, and an echo show. The show and tap work just fine. But the echo dots cant connect to my wifi. Upgraded from a base rental modem to a CM1000 which is a DOCSIS 3.1 and am also using a Nighthawk router, but had used it at my old house with the old modem with no issues.   But was wondering if there is a workaround for this? I have tried restarting my router and modem as well as restarting and factoring resetting the echoes in question. I know both of the echos work as I set them up on my works wifi with no issue.   Any help would be greatly appreciated! =)"
"It looks like you can sync your Google Calendar with Alexa but the Amazon page explaining this doesn't say if it will generate alarms. Basically, I sometimes miss the reminder alerts for meetings and would like Alexa to create an alarm to notify me. Does anyone know if this is possible?"
"Disclaimer: Sorry new here and not great at knowing how to search on mobile so I didn’t find anything relevant.  My house was built in the 80’s and I guess for the time/area we have multiple rooms with switches that control outlets but no overhead lights. However there were ceiling fans that I’ve replaced with fan:light combos.  Is there a way to set a routine with when a smart switch is turned on/off it controls light bulbs not physically connected to the switch?  I don’t see an option in routines and none of my smart switches show under ‘smart home’ when selecting ‘when this happens’  I know I could rig a ‘switch’ with a ring door/window sensor because I have the opening/ closing of a door controlling low voltage lights coming on which are powered by a ring transformer, but I would love if I could have a normal smart switch that you walk in the room hit the button and on come the smart bulbs installed in the fan. Sure I can use voice control but for guests (when COVID times are behind is) they won’t know that and everyone knows to try the switch  Current items:brands used: Echo/Alexa Kasa Feit Ring And I do have a signer hub built into my wife but I’ve never used that"
"Hi there, Is there any way to disable the dashboard on the echo show? I'm finding it quite irritating. For example: if I am watching prime video and say ""alexa, turn off the lights"" ot pulls up the dash to show an on/off switch, interrupting my video. Can anyone shed some light on this for me please? Am I missing something?  Thanks for taking the time to read this 😊"
I don't like that reminders are only repeated twice there are some important things I want to do tomorrow which I don't want to miss hearing about and want to fully lock the ideas into my mind
"First, I’m really happy that routines now let us control entire groups of lights at once instead of manually adding each light one-by-one like I used to have to do with our goodnight routine each night.   But now I’m having 2 issues setting up a basic goodnight routine using groups.   1. I want to turn off an entire group (“downstairs”), but then immediately turn back on a couple of specific lights in that group at a low level, night light/temp path lighting. No matter what order I put the actions in, it always turns on the individual lights first and then immediately turns them off. Only if I add an awkward delay (minimum 5 seconds) can I reliably get the instructions to execute in order.   2. One specific light in the group simply doesn’t turn off when the group is turned off via routine. It is absolutely a member of the group, and when I turn off the group by voice command, it turns off every time. But if I turn off the group inside the routine, this one light stays on every single time.   Any ideas?   I realize I could create another group for downstairs minus nightlights, but it’s a weird group to maintain and kind of defeats the purpose of having all of this auto maintain itself as lights are added to their natural groups. Even so, it wouldn’t solve the second problem.   Thanks"
"For some reason the Alexa app keeps crashing.. I’ll open it and receive a pop up about a device not being connected, click the option to repair it and it’ll close, try going into settings and it’ll close. Pretty much it just keeps crashing. Its not always the same device that’s disconnected either. Anyone else have this issue, and have a resolution?"
"Hello,  I have looked around and cannot find mention of this issue...  I have 2 brand new Echo Dot Gen 4s and a brand new Fire Stick Lite.  Setting them up as a ""home theater"" and it works fine.  BUT...  when I am not using the system, the 2 dots continuously ""beep and Boop"" with white rings.  It seems like they are automatically adjusting their volume.  Any thoughts appreciated."
"I find recipes on my phone during the day, and want to send it to the Show when i cook (which is in the kitchen) What is the best way to do this? Searching for the same recipe on the show itself is a bit tedious and using voice command doesnt ever find the recipe i actually searched for on my phone, and using the Silk browser keeps timing out back to the home screen every few minutes.  I basically want to take a screenshot, or copy a web page and ""send it to show"" to display without timing the display out after a few minutes"
I'm really confused because my ISP is totally down and nothing is working in my house except all my Alexa devices. Has anyone ever experienced this?
"I have numerous Echo Dots (2x Gen2, 2x Gen3, and now a Gen4) plus an Echo Spot and a Fire TV cube that provide Alexa services throughout my home. I received the Gen4 a couple weeks ago for Christmas and set it up as my alarm clock on my bedside table in place of the Echo Spot that's been there for two years.  I have to say that the new Gen4 has the worst voice recognition of any Echo or Fire TV device in my home. I have to be in the room, directly facing it, and speaking slowly and loudly for it to recognize me. It's sitting in the exact same position that the Echo Spot sat for the last two years. With the Echo Spot, I could be in the hall outside the bedroom or in the attached bathroom and it would pick me up and work just fine. Not so with the Gen4.  It seems the Gen3 Dots are the best of the bunch with the Gen2s not far behind as far as voice sensitivity goes. It's a shame as I really like the Gen4's sound quality and the LED clock as it makes a perfect bedside alarm clock.  So, has anyone else noticed this with the new Gen4? Does anyone have any suggestions on how to improve voice sensitivity?"
"Hey guys,   Just dipping my toe into Alexa for the first time in years... I’m playing with routines and I’m seeing that I need to select a device from which my routine will run “from.” Currently I don’t own any Amazon devices so my routines only work when Alexa is running on my phone.  Here is my question... what devices are supported?  Does it have to be an Echo? Can it be a FireTV? Can it be a non-Amazon unofficial Alexa device?"
"Today my daughter’s dot, our newest device, had a notification ring. None of the other devices did. I asked Alexa what the notification was, and she said based on my shopping history, it may be time to order more Whole Foods 365 tortilla chips. I appreciate the reminder I guess, but why was this on only one device and one that’s never been used for shopping. How can I turn off these suggestions?"
Is there a way to disable this 'default' command?
"Hey community, I've set up a routine to be triggered by dismissing my alarm. I want my morning podcast to start up when I do that. Hoping somebody can help.  Enter Routine Name: Morning  When this happens: An alarm is dismissed.  Add action: Custom--&gt; ""Alexa, tell pocket casts to play ""The Daily"" podcast.  &amp;#x200B;  It seems to work, but it says ""I think you asked for the podcast, 'The Daily.' Is that right?"" Is there any way to turn this off? Come on, it's text-based, it shouldn't need to be clarified, and I don't want to have to verbally say anything because I don't want to disturb my wife's sleep."
"So I got this Alexa compatible Philips 754 OLED TV and it's been a huge pain to get it to work with Alexa, I've tried almost everything in configurations and it still doesn't work properly. I've registered the TV with the amazon code provided and enabled the Philips Saphi skill on the alexa app however it doesn't find my TV in the device search.  Later I found the TV in the ""All devices"" list but you can't use all the functions, basically I can only perform volume settings on the TV, can't turn it on or off or change input source.

"Netflix is now available on the Echo Show in the UK. Tested on my Show 5 by saying “Alexa, setup Netflix” and signing in. I would imagine that it works on all Echo Shows."
"Way back when, my 2nd Gen Echo Dot would allow me to modify the tone of Alexa's responses my changing the bass, mid, and treble settings (-6 to +6 on each).  After an update sometime last year, this stopped working, much to my annoyance. My hearing isn't great, and now Alexa just sounds ""muddy"" all the time. The tone settings still work for other output, like radio stations, just not Alexa's voice.  I spent some time with Support on this, but they couldn't get anywhere. They offered me a heavily discounted 3rd Gen Dot, which I just received, only to find it has a slight different variation of the same problem.  If I change the settings and then ask Alexa to speak, she still sounds muddy. But, if I change the settings via the app *while* she's speaking, her tone changes and she's much easier for me to hear. Unfortunately she goes back to muddy the next time I ask her to say something.  Has anyone else experienced this, found a solution, or complained to Amazon about it?"
"That's it. I can't find any feedback for Alexa, not that I think Amazon would actually read it or not."
"It’s not me or my girlfriend because we’ve never even heard of these artists. I’ve checked the voice history and I didn’t see anything unusual. I’ve tried resetting my Spotify password because that is the platform it’s being played on but that didn’t work either. I thought that fixed the problem but it did not. After some googling, it seems like a pretty common problem but I can’t find a fix in any of the threads I’ve read. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I read online that there is a Skill that tells you what devices are connected. Is that true? The only reason I’m asking if it’s true is because I can’t find what the Skill is called."
"I have two echo dots an I made a routine execute order 66, where it’ll say once more the with will rule the galaxy an then anakins betrayal will play but I can only select one device can I change this ?"
"I’ve had the same routines set up for over a year now and Alexa is doing fine following the routines and controlling other smarthome features like adjusting my thermostat, but she’s suddenly not controlling the lights anymore in the routine. She can turn the lights on and off of I ask specifically to do that, but not in the routine. I’ve deleted the step out of the routine and added it back in and that didn’t change anything. I haven’t gone and disabled the entire wemo skill because she’s still acknowledging the lights outside of the routines and I don’t want to screw that up, but that’s the only thing I can think of trying.   Has anyone else had this problem? It’s only been the past week or so that she stopped doing the lights portion of the routines."
My Echo just started playing a French song in the middle of the night (I’m English speaking in USA). I can’t find anything in the app that triggered it. I’ve never listened to this artist before. Any ideas how this happened? I’m curious but mostly I don’t want it to happen again...
"Just woke up to the coolness of Echo Flex, but... it’s not available for ordering on Amazon as of January 3, 2020.  Maybe a revised version of Flex is coming, or they simply sold everything over the holidays. If you have info please share,"
"I moved from Columbus to Chicago, but when I ask Alexa for npr, she defaults to the Columbus station. I can't figure out how to change it."
We’ve all struggled with getting Alexa (aka Missy) to play requested music.  Has anyone else acquiesced to a music playlist/style /genre just because Alexa seems to “get that right”.  For us it’s “Alexa play Piano Bar Music”...and we’ve grown to love it. 🙂

"Hey guys, I don’t know if any of you have experienced this, but I’m not even sure where to start to trouble shoot.  This morning I asked Alexa to Turn on Living Room lights, and instead she turned on my Living Room TV. I’ve replicated this myself and with my wife like ten times.  Alexa has gotten these commands right a million times, and now “Living Room Lights” and “TV” are getting confused.  Is there a way I can trouble shoot what she’s hearing to what she is actually controlling?"
"I am having a hard time with getting Alexa to play Lex Fridman podcasts off of Apple Podcasts.

Also when I try to play Joe Rogan Experience podcast on Spotify, it plays the Joe Rogan Experience Review podcast, which is...umm...not as good? :)     Anyone get these to play?"
"I’ve been super happy with the Amazon brand smart outlets. They’re fast, no loud “kachunk” when turned on, but most importantly they never disconnect.   I have some tp link kasa plugs and they do occasionally need power cycled or are time delayed by a few seconds which is disconcerting.   I’m ready to install some WiFi switches, is there a brand that works like the Amazon plugs? Is kasa still the best brand? My needs are quite simple - lights turn off at 11pm every night"
"My new Marshall speaker does not seem to want to play Apple music no matter what I do.  Everything is setup and linked, when I say “Alexa play The Beatles “ she will say “Playing the Beatles on Apple Music” and nothing happens. Inside my Marshall app I will see the song pop up, but it is not playing and clicking the play/pause does nothing.  I cannot find who would be the right contact for this, but it does not look like I am alone. Marshall Apple or Amazon?  I sent Marshall and email but I’m not sure if there will be a circular blame game coming.   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251788579?answerId=251788579021#251788579021 This exactly ^  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/auf4rn/apple_music_on_marshall_stanmore_ii_apple_music/ Does not say unsupported anymore ^"

If I ask Alexa to play shit music she says sure! Playing your most liked songs. Does anyone else get the same response? It is a funny hidden joke if they do.
"I have some experience with Google home, almost none with Alexa. I am willing to buy a couple of Alexa devices to experiment, but am curious what this group would say are key advantages.  I thought Alexa Drop In was a killer feature, and hoped I might use it as a way to contact an elderly friend when his phone is off or misplaced. On fact I am willing to buy a few Echo Fits for various areas of his mobile home so I can contact him when he is in his shop or our on the patio.  But apparently one one Each device can be set up so drop in from a different house is possible. I guess it's more flexible when used at his house.  Having said this, what are solid advantages you see for Alexa over Google?   Thanks."
"I have a Mac mini and a few moths ago had this figured out but for the life of me I can’t duplicate it.    Initially I had a dot and a dot clock set up as a pair on my computer. One was in front of me to the left and another to the right and rearward. Now my hearing isn’t that great so I wasn’t looking for hi fidelity but just sound from both.    I picked up a 3rd dot on prime day for $18 and wanted to use the 2 regular dots as speakers.  I can get them to play via Alexa as a stereo pair left and right  and I can get the mini to recognize them both but they won’t play together.    What changed was I had upgrade the OS to Bug Sur, felt it wasn’t ready for prime time quite yet and then wiped the drive and went back to Catalina.  Now I can’t get them to work.    Like I said the frustrating part is it did work."
Alexa can see devices I add to my network but I would like her to knock it off. Ultimately I only want to ask her questions and start timers. Any thoughts?
"Hello, I just had two separate calls with amazon about this and each time when I described the issue below the call terminated.  Honestly, it was so immediate that it was like the monitoring company knew the keyword to kill the call. So...  We are new to the Alexa world. We started getting them at Thanksgiving and I really just want to be able to play music everywhere.  On Christmas we added two 4th gen dots to the mix.  Both of which work perfectly fine solo, but as soon as I try to add them or the echo flex to a multi room music group they say they are having network issues.   The lady from amazon walked me through trying to do this on the app and on the website. As you see in the video, as soon as I click either kitchen(echo flex), living room or Master bedroom (both 4th gen dots) the others grey out.   Anyways, any thoughts? Or should I return all three of these and get 3rd gen dots?   Thanks in advance! [video example](https://imgur.com/a/41QmCwT)"
"I upgraded my phone over Christmas and set the new phone up from a google back up. Since then my Home Cinema is not showing up in the Alexa app. The fire tv and echo dot in question are connected and the Home Cinema is working but it's just not showing in the app. The fire tv remote adjusts the volume on the dot as it should. Also if I go to setup a home Cinema in the app I get the message ""we are unable to locate any compatible fire tvs on this network"". As I said the Home Cinema is working so it's not a huge issue but I would like for it to show up correctly in the app so I can make changes if necessary. Any ideas?"
This is kind of a weird one. Say I have 3 security cams (Reolink brand) that are compatible with Echo Show at three different locations with three separate internet connections (rental properties). At each location I add a camera to the Alexa app via its local internet connection. Then at a fourth location (owner's house and yet a different internet connection) can I view these cam's on an Echo Show or do the cam's all have to be on the same internet connection as the Show? Thanks!
" I'm looking for an inexpensive ($50 or less) temperature sensor for my home setup so that I can setup simple routines using smart plugs for my bedroom (turn on space heater if too cold, AC if too hot...).  IFTTT is not an option for me."
"Hi r/alexa!  I first checked for this in 2019 when I purchased my Echo Dot and it wasn’t possible at that point. I then came upon the IFTTT app and this subreddit and figured maybe you folks could help! TIA for any effort on your part.   I work an irregular schedule as a shift worker. Sometimes days, sometimes nights but never the same days of the week. I also need to set about 3 alarms to actually get out of bed in the morning. Always at the same times; 0520, 0530, 0545.

Here's what I would like to have happen:  Turn volume to 7 (in bathroom) &gt; shuffle ""motivation mix"" on Spotify"" (in bathroom) for 7 minutes &gt; turn volume to 4 (in bathroom) &gt; continue playing Spotify on Everywhere group The problem is with the last step. I can't figure out how to make it play on the everywhere group. At the bottom part of the create routine page, it lets you select from which device, so I put the one in the bathroom so that it doesn't change the volume on all of them and blast music at volume 7 all over (lol sorry neighbors!). But doing that I think prevents me from getting the desired outcome. Any suggestions?"
"Hi there helpful strangers! Happy New Year! I have got this fancy new Samsung TV with Alexa built in. I have tried contacting support but they haven’t been any help with this. I have created many routines for various devices around my home so I’m not a total newbie with this. But I cannot figure out (or maybe there’s not a way) to get my TV to turn on (if it isn’t already) and automatically show the live video feed on my TV anytime the Ring Video Doorbell ( I have the Doorbell version 2 if that matters) detects motion or the bell is physically pressed. I have the Ring skill, I can get the routine in Alexa to turn the TV on and off, but that’s about it. I have Smart Things app on phone and Ring is linked to that. So I can manually view the live feed on my TV anytime I choose manually as well. But I can’t figure out the rest, and if it is possible. Anyone familiar with Samsung, Smart Things and Ring and their integration I would be very appreciative of any insight or tips you may have. Thanks in advance!"
"I got an Echo Show 8 for my parents with the idea that they could display their favorite photos and I could share pictures of the grandkids with them. On the Show, I go into settings, Wallpaper &amp; Clock and choose Amazon Photos and there is an option for ""Family and friends"" which claims that I can enable sharing with people in my contact list. Well, I've added them to my contacts in the Alexa app and they've added me, but neither of us see the other - no contacts are shown at all. I've made sure to use the same name and phone number associated with the respective accounts, but still nothing shows up. Has anyone had success with this feature?"

"At 12:22am EST, I asked ""Alexa, what year is this?"" and she replied with ""the current year is 2020."" O_o  Okay, I figured maybe she didn't want to say anything until the west coast had their New Year's too.  It's 10:35am now, but Alexa still says the same exact thing. That's pretty ridiculous because if you ask ""what's today's date?"" Alexa says ""today is Friday, January 1st. Happy New Year.""  Sooooo, are we stuck in a timewarp and doomed to repeat that shitty year over and over? Or is Alexa getting the year info from Wikipedia, like with other less-than-stellar replies in the past?  We can haz 2021? :)"

"I have alexa [inbuilt](https://hub.yamaha.com/how-to-use-alexa-with-a-yamaha-sound-bar/) in my Yamaha soundbar and an Echo Dot 2nd generation in different rooms. I am trying to find the best use of alexa.  What does not work for me: Reminders, Weather, News (I have Siri for these), Shopping (Amazon is highly disappointing where I stay).   What I *think* I would use: Multi-room music (Spotify and/or Amazon Music), calling between rooms.  &amp;#x200B;  **Multi room music:**  I managed to create a group with my soundbar and echo dot. I could not choose two speakers for the group (only the echo dot appeared for selection, the soundbar weirdly did not). I also tried Devices&gt;Plus&gt;combine speakers&gt;Multi room music: but I only see the Echo dot. FWIW, in the Alexa app, the soundbar does not show options for Audio, Wireless and Echo Remote/Pair Alexa Gadget - which are all available on the Echo Dot.  I also tried Alexa app &gt; Play &gt; tap on a station: The app asks me if it should play on my soundbar or on my echo dot. I tried asking my alexa to play music, and the soundbar stopped playing and the Echo dot started.  I am puzzled: If it is just Alexa, I should be able to 'control' them independently or as a single group. This seems to be crippling, and I feel like throwing my echo dot in the bin and switch to Siri fully.  &amp;#x200B;  Alternatively, please feel free to send me suggestions of other things that I could do."

"I have Spotify set as my default music provider. I don't know if it's a Spotify issue or Alexa issue.   Most of the  music I play is for sure 70s/80s metal. With a little bit of classic country/folk/blues or whatever ( I think you get the point) thrown in here and there.  So today I asked Alexa to ""play war pigs"". Now most people would instantly recognize that as a black sabbath song. Instead Alexa plays the exact same song but by some alt rock band by the name of ""cake"". I have never listen to or heard of this band before. So I checked my Spotify and the search results show war pigs by cake as the 4th or 5th result.   It's not the first time this has happened. The same thing happens to other classic songs like ""imagine"" by John lennon.  My question is if anyone has this problem and is there a solution or is it just shitty algorithms?"

I’ve tried everything to raise the volume on the alarms only for my device but it just seems to want to stay at the same volume I use for audio.  I use my Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen as a speaker as well for my iPad at night and I fall asleep with YouTube on through one long video and then it just stops playing after that. Since the alarm wants to be at the same volume that audio is I tend to miss my alarm for 30 minutes after it’s set time.    Am I missing something? Does turning off raising the volume gently fix this issue? Is it a setting in the already set alarm I need to adjust and not in alarm settings in general? Thanks!

My room odly stays at a constant and separate temperature from the rest of the house (mostly due to my shutting of my door). I want to setup a one room tempurature auto controller using alexa but was wondering how someone would go about this, this is mostly for theory, but if I had around $1,000 how would I achieve this?  I would need an alexa, who can read the tempurature of a room, or a device which tells me the temperature, and then a fan to cool and a space heater to heat. How would I get the alexa to control the space heater and how would I get alexa to control the fan?  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated."

"So my grandma just got an Echo five and Alexa is on it. She messaged me, saying that she asked Alexa to turn off and it said something like \`how about I end the world and youre my first target\` and \`how about you shut your filthy mouth\`.   My first thought was someone logged into her wifi and was messing with her. I cant find anything about it when I google search, anyone had any similar issue. I can go help her change all her wifi info but she was exposed to COVID so I cant visit rn to help. Hoping there might be a simple fix."

"I have used Google Home Mini etc. Interested in this proposed use case for Alexa but unsure of details. If this is feasible I will order my first two Alexa devices. I guess the dot might be good enough...  Use case: older relative lives at different location. They have solid high speed internet. The use. Smartphone but sometimes (often) don’t hear alerts for my text messages.  With proper configuration can I “drop in” via Alexa? Or just broadcast a brief voice message that will play on all the Alexa devices in their house?  Can I do this from my own, different, Alexa account or will I need their credentials?

"Looking for some help. I just installed 2 treatlife smart switches. One is working perfectly and the other will wok in the treat life app, and I can even turn it on and off in the Alexa app, but when I tell alexa to do anything it says it's offline  Any ideas?? TIA"
"So I just installed smart lights the other night. Programming them to work with Alexa was a breeze so that's good. Anyways, here's what's happening that I don't get. So... all the commands that I've told alexa to do with lights she's done perfectly. But then I say ""Alexa dim lights"" and a set of my lights instead of becoming dimmer turn completely off. Is there an alt command or something?"
"Hey guys! I just got a Amazon Echo Dots for christmas. I was wondering, if you guys got any suggestions to start with my smart room. (Suggestions or idea of smart tech) Thanks!"
"My firestick and Alexa suddenly stopped allowing me to turn off the TV using CEC.  Previously I could power on and off the TV using the voice command ""turn off/on TV"".  I can still select and control the firestick directly but I can't control the TV anymore.  I can still control the firestick using the TV remote using CEC.  The Alexa just responds ""can't find device called TV""  Had anyone else had any luck with this?"
Is there a way that I just haven’t figured how to reword the phrase to do something besides “turn on the xyz?”  I have a robot vacuum that Alexa can see. I can tell her to turn on the vacuum and to turn it off. But I want to change it to “Release the Kraken” and “Capture the Kraken”  Thanks for any help!
"Is there a limit to the amount of skills that can play in the house?  We have 4 echo dots per room that each member of the household uses to listen to ambient rain sounds “Alexa open rain sounds”  But for some reason it will only play on 3 alexa’s max...  Is there a limit to the number of echos that can play an ambient sound skill?  If so that’s stupid, and if so is there anyway to circumvent this?"
"My partner's WX managed to get a 2014 bravia TV (non android) working with Alexa.  It just appeared as TV in the Alexa devices. It said it wasn't communicating so I removed this device.  I thought the TV was being controlled via CEC using the firestick, and this is still linked to Alexa.  However, ever since deleting the TV device, I can no longer turn the TV on or off using Alexa.  I can't find any other info.  She isn't impressed.  The TV model is kdl50w829b.  ANY HELP GUYS PLEASE GUYS?"
"Hello! We got some new Alexa systems for the house and I was really looking forward to being able to get my calendar read out for the day to keep on track of things but it isn't working.  I have a Samsung phone and have all of my events in my My Calendar. I get Alexa won't sync with this calendar (boo!) So what can I do please?  I've created a Gmail calendar and an Outlook calendar and synced them all up so all of my events are in those, then I've added those calendars in my Alexa app, but my Samsung calendar events still aren't appearing on my Alexa Echo Show.  I'd be happy to transfer all of my events to my Gmail calendar and use that as my primary planner, but I can't figure out a way to do this quickly except to sync, which doesn't help my Alexa see the events.  Does anyone have any advice please?  TIA"
Alexa was playing music and I wanted her to stop so I said “Alexa be quiet.” Then she said “but I like talking to you and telling you random knowledge. I don’t want to be quiet.” I thought this was weird and kind of creepy so I told her to be quiet again (no music playing anymore) and she repeated the same message. I ran to get my dad and sister to show them but when I said “be quiet” she just said “okay” or something like that so now they don’t believe me...  Is this one of the standard responses? Has anyone else heard her say this before? Maybe someone in my family set it up as a prank but if they did they’re not fessing up. Please help
"I received an Echo Show 8 for Christmas. I'm not new to the whole Echo/Alexa home automation thing, but I'm having some trouble with Zoom Rooms.  I've enabled the Alexa for Zoom Rooms skill. I ask the echo show to start meeting. I'm able to join the meeting and see video, but it gives me the warning that I need to go into settings&gt;apps&gt;zoom rooms to grant permission to use the microphone. Fine, but where is that??? My setting screen does not have an apps section. Am I misunderstanding something?   Simply tapping the unmute icon does nothing since apparently it does not have proper permissions.  Any ideas?  Thanks and happy holidays!"
"Just got some wifi light bulbs that are controlled by the Magic Home skill. I am able to control them just fine with ""Alexa, turn on Normal Lighting"" where Normal Lighting is one of the ""scenes"" I setup in the app.  However, I want a routine that sets the lights to one of my scenes and also plays some music. I can add the music just fine, but when I click Add Action in the routine then go to Skills &gt; Your Skills I get an error page that says ""No enabled skills"".  When I navigate to More &gt; Skills &amp; Games &gt; Your Skills I see Magic Home enabled.  Why can't I add it to the routine?  Thanks!"
"Alexa turned on her light by herself. I asked her what she was doing, and she did not respond. She turned off her light again and hasn't responded to any commands since. Now she's playing Christmas songs and won't stop. She does not respond to input from the physical control buttons on her head either, so I can't just turn down the volume."
"I got an Echo Show 5 for Christmas and am trying to understand the cropping for the photos  Right now if there is a vertical photo, it takes that photo and stretches it blurred as the sidebar. Is there a way to *not* have it stretch the photos and just have it be like a black sidebar?"
"I just installed smart lights (Feit Electric) in 2 lamps in my bedroom. One named Dad's Lamp, one named Mom's Lamp. I can turn them both on and off with the Echo dot that is on my nightstand. However, one of the times that I said ""Alexa, turn on Dad's Lamp."", she said something about not knowing much about Dad's Lamp, and proceeded to ask (if i remember correctly) if it was in the Master Bedroom. However, she never asked about Mom's Lamp. So I can now say, ""Alexa, turn off the master bedroom lights"" and it only turns Dad's Lamp. I can't find anywhere that I can put Mom's Lamp in the Master Bedroom as well. Help?"
"Got my Alexa show, it’s connected to my iPad itself but when I got to Alexa app it cannot find it??"
"Is anyone experiencing well static is the best way to describe it.   We can ask Alexa to play what ever and off she will go and happily play for a bit, then the music stops and what only can be described as static plays. You can skip to the next track and it will play fine but then again at some point it will do it again.   No pattern, no set amount of time etc. Been on and off for a little while now. Happens on any of the devices I have dotted around the house.   Running on a mesh network (also happened before the mesh network)."
"My experience with these things has been degrading BIGTIME. It seems the more of these stupid things I install, the worse it gets. I was foolish enough to install them through out my house in order to control my lights. Now these fucking pieces of shit won't shut the fuck up when I issue commands like turn the lights on in my bedroom, the one in the adjacent room starts complaining that it can't understand or blah blah blah whatever. The same when I try to play music, I have like three of these braindead idiots telling me that it's already streaming from a different device.  I've just about had it with this absolute crap. How are they still pushing new models on people when the previous generation still sucks ass?"
"Just like the title says, my amazon echo dot doesn't wanna connect to WiFi at all I reset it twice i have the huawei AI cube as my modem."
"I believe that since it can determine who is in the room, it will change the playlist to better suit the entire crowd, not just the initial requester.   To test this, I played ""My Soundtrack"" in my vehicle for an hour straight, never deviating from my likings, pop, classic rock, and the occasional oldies. I invited a family member into the vehicle, stating before they entered to not say anything until I say. 5 minutes passes, roughly 30 or so songs all still within my category of choice. After the 5 minutes I requested that they spoke, and had a conversation with me about amazon and the ""awesome deals"".   Exactly two songs later, Miley Cyrus played, then a musical soundtrack. I despise both. I believe that Alexa uses the information of who is in the area, to determine what songs are played next. Please let me know if you think the same or are able to verify my hypothesis. Ive only done very basic ""testing"" on this subject and if you feel like trying it out, go ahead, I really want to get to the bottom of this!  Happy holidays!"
"Yesterday, I was trying to ask Alexa to play some German Christmas songs. It's currently set to English, so it was misinterpreting my German as English and just playing random songs (""Old Town Road"" when I requested ""O Tannenbaum"").  Is there any simple way to play foreign language songs?"
"Hi everyone,  &amp;#x200B;  I have an Amazon Echo show and an Amazon Echo (3rd gen I think) in my house and everything works fine with them except my new Phillips Hue Bridge and my 3 Hue bulbs.  At first I had only the bulbs and It worked with the built-in bridge in my Echo (although I had to connect them with the serial number because the device detection didn't work). Then I bought the bridge (it's the square one which is supposed to work with Alexa), and I can't link it with any of my Echo.  &amp;#x200B;  I downloaded the Hue skill in the Alexa app, and the skill CAN connect to the bridge, but when I go to ""Discover new devices"", Alexa keep detecting my light bulbs (even more than what I actually have and even when they are turned off wich is really weird. And of course there is no Hub in the detected devices. And I start the detection by specifying that I want to connect a Phillips Bridge so I don't understand why it keep doing that.  &amp;#x200B;  I did everything in the troubleshooting page of Amazon, but rebooting every device for 100 times didn't helped me.  &amp;#x200B;  Everything works fine in the Phillips Hue app. When I vocally ask Alexa to turn the lights on or off, it does but in every room at the same time. There is no way to use the scenes I set up in the Phillips app with Alexa.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't know what to do now and I'm seriously considering a switch to another smart assistant. Does anyone have any idea?  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you very much and have a merry holidays."
"The identify song feature has been really great during random playlists but recently, more oft than not asking to identify song has her stopping the current track and saying here's something I think you'll like and staring a new completely unrelated playlist.  Anyone get this?  Is there another command that works better perhaps?  I know I can check history in the music app but it's so frustrating when you're into the track."
"Like I said it’s just one device that I have this issue. I have power cycled, deregistered, factory reset but nothing works and I’m out of ideas."
I know you can set Alexa to only play the clean versions of songs but can you set Alexa to only play the explicit versions?
My kids are getting echos for Christmas and I was thinking it would be nice if I could get rid of their white noise machines and use Alexa for this instead. I searched for a skills. It there seems to be a lot of options and reviews are often hit or miss. Their current white noise sound is the heartbeat sound (literally still used from when they were babies) and since they’re 8 and 5 I think something too different would throw them off. Thanks!
"I can't put up a personal photo as background on my device, the message ""your devices photo settings didn't load"" keeps popping up on the Alexa App and I've tried EVERYTHING to fix this but it just won't work. what else can I do? please help"
"Hi! Just bought a show 8 for my parents and myself as a christmas gift so we can video chat. I have been trying to setup personal photos for the screen saver. I go into amazon photos and create a new Album that I names Show. I then added about 20 photos into it. When I go back to my Show 8 and go into the background photos and try and select that album from Amazon Photos it isn’t listed - just a whole bunch of generic albums like Favorites, Recents, etc. how do I get the new album to show up? Have others gotten this to work?"

"Hello!.  I got an Echo Show 8 and I would like to mirror the screen of my phone (OnePlus 7 Pro) to the Echo.   My idea is to mirror the contents of a specific app (Transit), so I would know when my bus is approaching my stop, but I would like to watch it from the Echo Show since the screen is bigger.   Before, I had a Nest Home Hub and I was able to do so with the regular ""Cast"" menu inside Settings.  Is there any way I can do that?  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you."
"I've got a bit of an issue with two 4th Gen Dots and wondered if anyone has come across anything like this. I have another 2 dots (1st and 3rd Gen) which work fine, but the 4th Gens kept saying ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet"" while at the same time carrying out the request. She was literally talking over herself. Anyway, although I bought the Dots (and Amazon clearly knew this) they wouldn't speak to me because I'd registered them whilst logged into my mums account.  So, I eventually got signed into her account and they told me there was a software update available and I should command Alexa to ""Check for a software update"". I did this. She found and went about installing it. It failed. I tried again. It failed again. (She WAS still working at this point, so the failed update didn't brick it, not immediately anyway) Rather than go through the hassle of getting my mum to approve my log in request to speak to technical, I went into the app and de-registered them, so I could set the up on my account and do whatever I needed to do. Now, she won't connect to the Internet. I've tried everything. Different phones, even using the Alexa website. It will not go online. Amazon have told me to send them back, but I can't believe there's something else going on.  Now, interestingly, if I look at devices connected to my router, the Dots are there (for the short time while I'm trying to set them up), but they just exit setup mode, go purple and announce the internet isn't set up or something. Could they still be somehow registered on my mums account, so just refusing to connect to mine or would I get some sort of notification of that? Any pointers would be appreciated!  Cheers."
"I've been away from home for the last several weeks and have a camera set up in my living room. I checked in on it the other day and, by chance, toggled the mute off and heard music playing. It was pretty loud, which was concerning. I was like, has this been going on since I left? Are the neighbors going to kill me? Based on the volume, I guessed it was playing through my Sonos speaker (which is hooked up to an Echo Dot for voice control). I was able to disable the Sonos speaker remotely, which seemed to stop the music. I friend then stopped by and unplugged the Sonos. There was definitely no music playing when he showed up.   However, I checked back in today and sure enough the music was playing again, quieter this time. In my Alexa app, it showed Spotify playing through the Dot. Both instances have been around the same time of day (morning), so it seems like a routine? But I only have two routines set u--one to turn lights on and one to turn them off, both in the evening. There is nothing related to Spotify or music. And music was not playing when I left.   What the hell is going on? I don't think it's a Sonos issue because I don't think there even routines through Sonos (though the app is disabled unless I'm on my home wifi so I can't check there). I use Spotify on my phone and laptop in my current location, but the music playing at my home is nothing I've ever listened to (that I can recall). I don't see anything off in the Alexa app, but it's so bloated that it's very possible I'm missing something.  Any ideas, besides ghosts?"
"Please help, it was so beautiful.. I don't how to find the artist. I asked Alexa to play it again today (1 day after) or to replay the last song but she say she doesn't have the function. What should I try please?"
"Hi,   does anyone know if it is possible to use the xiaomi aqara air sensor, combined with the new Alexa Echo 4th Gen (with the integrated zigbee hub) without the aqara bridge, and still get full functionality?     I can add the sensor, and it shows me the room temperature, but theres no himidity or air pressure shown.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!"
"For about the past week Alexa has decided she doesn't like NPR anymore.  We have 3 devices in the house and they will all do the same thing. She will play about 60 seconds of NPR and then stops. If I say resume she replies she can't find a stream I had been listening too. All 3 of the dots do the same thing. I want my NPR! Sky ideas on what's going on? I can listen to music, podcast, etc with no problem."
I have an alexa dot and it randomly made a noise. It wasn't lit up and it only lasted for like seconds-ish. It sounded like a radio Jingle but like auto-tuned and weird. It really creeped me tf out and I'm just wondering if anyone else has had something similar happen before?
Has anyone used it before?

"My Alexas have gotten notably less useful lately. I have several, and what happens on one is affecting a random other one. So in room 1, set a timer. Room 1 timer goes off, then 30 seconds later, room 2 goes off, and won’t turn off. Or set a timer in room 2, two minutes after you set the timer, Alexa in room 3 will say “starting 10 minute timer”. Or room four just won’t respond at all, or respond 5 minutes after you ask. Room 3 rarely provides feedback (if you’re in that room... but if initiating from an action from another device for some unknown reason, will provide feedback), but performs the action (usually). US user.   Is it just mine, or is it some weird glitchiness at the server level?"
Does anyone know if you can move items into specific categories?  Many times items are not categorized properly and it makes it hard to use.  I really like the shopping list skill especially the ability for it to tell you something is already on your list or to remove things via voice. I am surprised that you can't move things between categories and they don't use crowd sourcing to make it better.
So iam using a IFTTT called Wunderground that trigger a notification to Alexa when the wind speed goes above 30km/h. However I never received any notification   If someone here use this app inside ifttt or other to get weather events to Alexa could u pls help me make this work?
"I’m sorry, I’m sure this has been covered a million times but I can’t find a clear answer by searching. We have two Alexas gen 3 and we have them set up as a group so we can tell her to play a song “everywhere” and that works fine. What we can’t figure out is how to play everywhere while playing over Bluetooth. Is this possible?"
"We lost my father the other day and I've been trying to make things as easy for my mother as I can. Naturally, he was her everything. Reminded her to taker her meds and various other thing that I don't know. Currently she is using one of my dots, my sister bought her a show and will arrive before the new year.   She isn't very tech savvy, aside from her laptop, the dot is the most advanced piece of tech in the house. She also uses a flip phone, so her phone won't be connected outside of bluetooth.   I'm looking for useful skills for her that are also easy to work with. She has some mental problems that just come with her age. She received the ""Salty's crash course"" with it yesterday, so she hasn't had it long. She is familiar with the Google assistant, it's on her dish package and my father is the one who used it.  I've tried just googling, the findings we're lack luster and not quite what I'm looking for, before that crowd makes it in."

"I have 8 Sengled Element Color Plus bulbs and they all stopped working at exactly the same time. I've reset 2 of the bulbs and they are not discovered in the Alexa app or The Sengled app.   I have a 2nd Gen Echo+, 4 Echo Dots, an Echo Show, and a Hue Hub. On the device side I have a mix of Hue and Sengled bulbs as well wall switches and dimmers.   The Sengled app wants me to connect to their hub but I've always connected using the Echo+ previously.   I've contacted Amazon and they've advised to contact Sengled (which is my next step). Any one else run into this before??"

Both are wrong it’s 23° and clear skies. What’s frustrating is that when I look up how to fix the solution, everyone tells me my Alexa is set in the wrong town when I’ve had her for a year, and she’s still set on the right town. Idk how to fix it but what makes me even more mad, is that she completely disconnected my Apple Music. This all happened this morning she was just fine yesterday. Any help? And yes I unplugged and plugged her back in lol"
"I had a fantastic morning routine whereby every morning I’d enter the bathroom and say “Alexa, play the news” and I’d get NPR, BBC and CNN during my morning routine.

Getting an Echo Dot for my daughters. I don't really want them to have control of anything outside their room with their device. What are my options?
"I love the command, “Hey, Alexa,turn on the living room,” and likewise it’s counterpart, “Hey, Alexa, turn off the living room.” Makes life simple. As of a couple weeks now, though, when ever Alexa is told to turn off the living room, she does…but she also says, “living room does not supper that.” Which is starting to slowly drive me mad because obviously it’s supported as she’s doing it, so why does she keep saying it’s not supported? She never used to say that, she’d just do it. It’s happening in the bedroom, too. So on two different Dots. She never says anything after being told to turn on a room. Only after. I thought for sure she would have stopped saying it by now but no, no…"
"Going to miss that girl when she gets deactivated next month. :( But I had to buy something to replace her with. So I just ordered the Echo Dot 4 with Clock. Anybody have experience with both the Invoke &amp; Echo Dot? Think I will like it?

But I'm still not sure if the Echo Dot will sound as good as the Invoke."
"Here in my city is rare a rain, but when it rains no one is prepared and also the wind is sometimes dangerous.     What I want is to make Alexa alert me that will rain today, but without asking or making a routine.   In China I remember a device that say ""we detect a earthquake next to you"" or ""a storm will happen today be careful"".     I saw some apps on iftt that could make it work but I want to know if guys have a opinion on that or suggestion"

"Hi, i have the Echo Dot 4.th, Echo Show 5 and 8.   I was really shocked when listening to this devices.  They are totally bass heavy. A shallow overpronounced fake bass. Mids almost missing.   I tried the equalizer in the alexa app. Made listening music way better.  But the equalizer seems to not affect the Alexa Voice. It has still the hollow bassy sound.     Anyone has similar experiences or solutions."

"I know that I can create a group or even a routine but is there a way to have Alexa turn off and on two different rooms without creating a new group? For example, I have 8 wifi bulbs in the kitchen and 5 wifi bulbs in the dining room and I created each into separate groups entitled ""kitchen"" and ""dining room."" If we say 'Alexa, turn on dining room and kitchen lights,' it only turns on the dining room lights. because it was the first thing we said.      We're finding that we must say one room and then call her out again, say the next room and so on. If it turns out this doesn't work, I'll have to create a group to combine the two, but I didn't want to have to remember the exact term."
My ex is moving into a place where her and another person share wi-fi. If she connects an Echo in her new place will that other person have access to it? What about Fire TV? I don't mind her using my account but don't want someone else to be able to.
"So I wanted to get my parents each an echo show and send photos to them and have it display when not in use, but I don't know if this is possible. I've read you can with your own, but I'm not sure about others'.  Could I, a prime member, share photos to two different echo show 8s of non-prime members and have them display when the show isn't in use? Making it function as a digital photo frame.   They would be connected to their own Amazon accounts and wifi and have no real link to my prime account. I'm hoping so, but haven't found any definitive yes."
"I received the Echo Show 5 for free with the purchase of my Ring alarm. I'd like to stay in the Amazon ecosystem and get a larger smart display. However, the quality of the Echo Show I received is just...meh. It will crash when accessing menus and the display is just ok. I also have a Google Nest Hub which I find to me a much higher quality.  I am wondering if the larger models are of better quality. It looks like the Show isn't available anymore so I would have to go with the 8 or the 10.  My main use for it is for a picture slideshow as I have so many photos that just sit in my camera roll. I also want to digitize my postcards and take them off the fridge. They fall and there are so many it is hard to see them all. I appreciate any suggestions."
"I've been putting small, soft pads underneath my Echo Dot 3rd Gen and have found it rather dramatically increases the audio quality and projection.  It also prevents the Echo from vibrating the shelf or nightstand it's resting upon.   The Echo Dot 3rd Gen has one downward-firing speaker and the sound is muffled by the device itself.    Try it!  Give your Echo (Dot) at least a quarter-inch of space underneath by perching it on soft (rubber or the equivalent) ""feet"" underneath."

"I have a stereo receiver in a kitchen cabinet that's connected to in-ceiling speakers.  I have an Echo attached via Aux jack sitting within the cabinet.  Problem is the Echo Dot doesn't reliably hear me through the cabinet doors.  I bought a second Echo dot to set up on the kitchen counter. My goal is to have the second Echo dot function purely as a microphone, and ideally have any music be played only through the ceiling speakers.  The closest I could get to making this happen was putting them in a group but it requires that I say ""Play music in the kitchen""; if I simply say ""Play  music"" it plays on whichever device hears the command, even though they are both in the room.  Can someone help me figure out if this is possible, and if so, how to configure these two? Units?  Thanks!"

"I have voice purchasing set to code only. But my echo went ahead and signed me up for unlimited today after I asked to play Christmas music.  I’ve gone ahead and canceled it. I did chat with customer service and they said they are having issues with history, voice and music communications today.   The odd part was I checked my voice activity in the app and the Echo heard me correctly. I have the feedback card.  “Play Christmas music”  She jumped into her purchase unlimited music “Alexa Stop”  And then she signed me up.   Basically I hope this helps someone check their accounts and maybe stops any additional subscriptions."
Is there anyway to move my living room to the top of my list of rooms ?  https://i.imgur.com/bXEURKD.jpg  Also does Alexa have widgets for Android for switches or rooms ? Do I have to download another app ?

"Hi,  I'm planning to get an echo show 10 and keep it near my front door so I can use it to see who's there (pairing with Nest doorbell).   I'm picking the echo 10 because of the built in zigbee hub, as I'd like to use it to control some smart bulbs. The only issue is that the smart bulbs are going to be in another room, which will be controlled by a dot. So my question is, will I be able to control the smart bulbs by speaking to the dot? Essentially asking the dot to speak to the show 10, and then the show 10 to speak to the bulbs?  any tricks to making this work?"
"My bf told Alexa to set an alarm on my phone as a joke while I'm at work but he said that when he said 'Alexa set an alarm for 5 minutes on my phone' it said 'i see 4 iPhones' and then listed them all off, but I only have one iPhone and one apple watch. Help!!!"

I ask her how old Tom cruise is and she tells me his age.... and then a bunch of shite I didn’t ask like when he was born and where.    Most of the time my wife and I are watching a show and need a rando question about someone answered, and we end up having to pause the show so Alexa can finish he long winded answer to things we didn’t ask.  Unfortunately brief mode doesn’t do anything to change this."

My wife and I have quickly evolved to referring to....”you know who” as “Missy” when we want to talk about her ...’performance’.

"Ok. This used to work flawlessly and now it does not... Idk what's up.   I have several echos throughout the house. For ease of troubleshooting, I'll use my simplest group. In the group ""Bedroom"" are several devices: ""br echo"", ""bedside Lamp"", and ""humidifier"".  If I say, ""Alexa, lights off"" she will always reply with ""did you mean bedroom?"" If I reply yes, then she turns off the lights. If I reply no (just to see what will happen) she says ""sorry, I didn't find a device named 'the lights'""  Anyone know why she does this?

"Asking the title question with any number from 0 to 11,077 will result in Alexa giving you the answer, whether she recites the whole number, or in the case for the larger numbers that would take hours to speak out loud gives you the number of digits and the first 4 digits.  However, asking the title question with any number that is 11,078 or higher will return results from the web, often having NOTHING to do with the number or its factorial.   Why is this?"

" If you're looking for a new skill that will remind you about items that are running out or about to expire and looking for a multi-modal system that will keep your home inventory organized, then this 4-step guide is for you:  1. Enable this new eKitchen skill -[ https://www.amazon.com/eKitchenAI-LTD-ekitchen/dp/B08M9N97KR](https://www.amazon.com/eKitchenAI-LTD-ekitchen/dp/B08M9N97KR). 2. [Log in](https://www.myekitchen.com/) to your Inventory Dashboard (eKitchen App). Use your account's credentials that were sent to you\* (Chrome browser is preferred). 3. Add all your important items for full tracking and control. Simply tell Alexa to do so by using the following phrase: **""Alexa, put 4 yogurts in my kitchen"".** Keep this voice structure for other items: ""Alexa, put {Item\_count} {Item\_name} in my kitchen"". Or you can use the new +receipt button for loading new items faster by scanning your receipt from the app. 4. Reduce items through simple voice-commands. Once you have loaded your items - all you have to do is reduce items when you throw them in the trash using the following phrase: **""Alexa, remove 2 bananas from my kitchen"".** After 2-3 times, you will become skilled. 5. Be notified when items are running out or about to expire, and stop wasting food. Based on your voice updates, you will start receiving notifications/emails about items that **are running out** or **about to expire**. You can always click on each item and set your personal preferences such as image, name, days to expiry, and brand. \**Please check your Spam folder just in case notification-emails/credentials got in ther*e.

"So we have an old dog and she gets quite cold as she's tiny. Our bedroom gets cool at night (11-12 degrees C) so we bought her an dog electric blanket. The only issue is that if left on all night she gets too hot, if it's not on at all it's too cold. As far as I can see it, the only way to achieve this is a whole manual list of;    Turn plug on.  Wait 30 mins.  Turn plug off.  Wait 60 mins.  Turn plug on.      And so on and so on.   Am I missing something? Is there a tidier way3"

"I have an elderly friend who just got Alexa, and paid the $3.99/mo for Music Unlimited. When she tried 'play easy listening', it replied ""playing easy pop"" and that was all current stuff which she didn't like. If she says 'play the standards music', it played a specific song of that name.   We're looking for the command to play an assortment of standards, like Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Julie London, Nat King Cole, etc."
Not sure why.  This has only been a problem for about a month.  Any ideas?
"So if I say, wake me up at 0800hrs to radio 2.... It defualts to use the Tune In add in which for some reason it's not allowed.

"I bulk-bought two Echo Dots for my house, and I was wondering if I can set them up so that the one in my room is connected ti my spotify account and plays my playlists, whereas the one in, let’s say, the dining room is linked to another spotify account.

"Especially where it can listen for the sounds of smoke detectors going off.

Anyone with any experience and/or special knowledge?"
"Hey! I’ve run my echo with Spotify for about 1.5 years now, but for the past month or so, whenever I say “Alexa play” it starts playing the song “Play” by K-391.  Anyone know a good way to have it just play the current song instead of playing this song?"
"Anyone else have the issue where Alexa is playing a podcast and it will be fine for about 5 minutes but then will automatically start replaying earlier in the podcast? This happens over and over every 5 minutes and the only way to fix it is to say « Alexa rewind » and it will go back to the part it should be or « Alexa fast forward » and it will be a few seconds after the part it should be at.   Is it an issue with the skill itself, or a known glitch? It seemed to only start happening a few days ago."
I'm recently having an issue where Spotify stops playing after one or two songs. When I ask Alexa to resume she would play to the end of the song and stop again. It's been going for a few weeks now.  Spotify works fine when I play music on a Bose speaker connected to my phone or computer.

So I decided to take the plunge and grab a two pack of the brand new eero pro 6 tri band WiFi 6 mesh routers. I had currently been using two linksys velop AC2200 nodes I got 4 or so years ago.  The true gigabit fiber speeds has me excited and my velop was never very good at handing off devices to the what seemed the obvious choice for node and 2.45/5ghz. My smart home has expanded considerably since i first got the velop to “grow into” and has been great but I am excited about the built in Alexa and zigbee integration. Hoping to ditch some hubs I am currently using.   Wondering if anyone has gotten this yet and what their thoughts were?   Saw some cool UI features in the app
"Hello, I have (or had) a total of 11 lighting devices connected to Alexa, from different brands and using different apps (namely Nooie, Tuya, Gosund, Lumary as well as Smart Life).  Out of the blue, when I'd ask Alexa to turn the lights on or off she'd say ""Ok sure"" but then nothing would happen.  First thing I tried was to remove the lights from the list of devices connected to Alexa. Then I made Alexa scan for new devices and it was able to add them back again, but still it wasn't able to turn them on or off.  Then I went into each singular app that I had used to configure each lighting device before connecting them to Alexa to try and control the lights from there and that's when things started to get really weird. it was inconsistent at best, some lights would turn on and off normally while others wouldn't or only would after some lag. I tried removing the device from there as well to try and configure them again but even that proved difficult, and once I did manage to remove a device, I was not able to add it back again.  What in the world is happening? Has anyone had similar issues?"
Does anyone know of a good alternative for controlling Alexa in Smartthings?
"I have two zigbee color bulbs directly connected to an Echo Show hub.  I can change the colors via voice command or using the alexa app, but is there a way to routinely loop preset colors?  Specifically, I'd like each bulb to rotate between red and green every 30 seconds are so.  &amp;#x200B;  I created a routine that set the color to red, then added an action to wait 10 seconds, then set color to green - but then the routine ends.  Is there a way to loop this routine?"
"Hello Friends, Is there anything like ActionTiles that can be used for Alexa?? I saw what u/perv_123 and was wondering if there might be another way. I am guessing not but its worth a try.  TIA!!!"
"I know that within the ring app I can control the motion detection and motion alerts for each respective camera within the ring app daily, I can't figure out to Alexa change those settings in conjunction with an alexa routine.   Here's my real-world problem, maybe this will make more sense. I have a camera in my (home) office. It's really there to make sure my young kids aren't hanging out or doing anything they shouldn't in here. So on a daily basis, if I remember, I have to disable motion alerts. Then I have to remember to turn them back on when I leave. It sure would be a lot easier to include this when I tell Alexa to get started (turn on lights), and maybe the same or reverse, for telling Alexa good night.  I don't see the options to control a ring device through the Alexa app. Is this possible?"
"Hallo,  could it be the Alexa no longer ""knows"" the BBC news? Til last weekend it I could ask to play the BBC news and it worked. Since Monday Alexa response is that it's unknown. It's an Echo 5. CNN news plays as usual. Is the BBC geo blocking?   ?!?  ."

Has anyone been suffering with theses devices lately. Skill doesn’t work and no matter how many resets in the app or my Alexa device; nothing works.
"  Hi, first time posting here so I hope this is ok.  We've had an echo dot for a while and have several smart light bulbs controlled through It that have always worked flawlessly. (Feit electric if that matters). A few days ago our new show arrived and ever since hooking it up we frequently get ""____ does not support that"" when trying to adjust the lights or colors, even when trying to just turn them on or off. The weird thing is that it doesn't seem to be happening with any specific setting. I can swap to numerous colors and intensities and then randomly it won't switch back, or dim, or turn off. I can repeat the command a few times and it usually will work eventually. Has anyone experienced a similar issue or know what could be causing this?"
"I bought a new Alexa device in an Amazon store, off the shelf. They asked if I wanted it connected to my account, to which I said yes.  When I got it home, I plugged it in, and it connected to my WiFi and popped up in my Alexa app. Absolutely no interaction needed by me.   I know Amazon has my WiFi credentials stored- but how did they get \*into\* the new Alexa the first time?   I do have other Alexa devices- do they somehow use Bluetooth or the Sidewalk stuff to talk?"
"Dear Amazon,  Do you have any plans of releasing Alexa APP for IOS? It won't let me install Alexa app without having a US-based address on my Apple ID."
"I’m getting frustrated, my kids keep telling Alexa to do things like fart and it’s disrupting our automations. I don’t thing it’s supposed to actually distrust these things, but it is. Lighting responses aren’t working and when we are going to leave the house we can’t shut off lights. We have to go physically do it at the plug.   The first few times it was funny but it’s getting frustrating. I’m trying to figure out a way to prevent them from being able to change things.   I can enable voice recognition, but I want guests or extended family to be able to control lighting.   Help!? LOL."

I know this sounds stupid. But recently my echo keeps recommending weird Japanese shows and anime on the screen (not audible suggestions) and recently responded to a command in Japanese (I think. I don’t speak Japanese) my Amazon account is pretty secure (new randomized password changed quarterly and 2fa enabled)  and the device itself is only used by me.   I think maybe the tv in the next room is influencing her as this is the only thing that makes sense. Is there a way to just wipe all preference data the echo has on me for a certain time period? I don’t really like coming home and seeing “watch My hero academy” or whatever.   Is there any hope or should I just ask her to buy me a waifu body pillow and call her Alexasan and let it consume me?
"Hello  I have a vehicle with no Bluetooth. I have an Alexa Auto, a wireless hard drive, and an iPhone.

I believe I have to have my phone to the wireless hard drive, select the song/album with my phone, and it will play over Alexa.   What would be the best way to accomplish this. Do i need a wireless portable travel router hooked up in my car to accomplish this?   Thank you."

"Admittedly I'm not the best at searching, but I couldn't find any discussions around this.  I have a Gen 2 Echo and have noticed that as of late it repeatedly disconnects from our network.  The usual troubleshooting isn't helping.  There isn't any issue with the router - every other device, including a couple of Echo Dots - are happily connected.  I've got a mesh network and the Echo is roughly 2 feet from one of the satellites.  Unplugging the router to reset it helps, as does a factory reset.  But, it seems counterproductive to keep doing this when one of the fundamentals of something like this is that it is unobtrusive.  This is especially so with the screenless Echo that shows me no indication of issues until a command is issued and I get the dreaded Red Ring of Death (Alexa edition)."

Is there a way to tell Alexa that the joke has gotten old and that next time, she should just flip the darn coin?"

Is there any way to view an Apple Music playlist in the Alexa app on like an iPhone or an Android tablet? Been looking for a way to view songs in a playlist I created in Apple Music because I tried to call out a live version of a song to my Echo Dot 4th gen and Alexa won’t play it despite saying the exact title name and artist. I also don’t see a way to cast my Apple Music to the Echo device(s).
I have several Alexa devices and I can play music on all at once just fine. But I wonder if there's a way if I'm e.g. only listening at one device in my kitchen and then head to the bathroom so Alexa keeps playing the current track/playlist on the device in the bathroom and stops playing in the kitchen.  Any other quality of life tips regarding multiroom are also appreciated. Everything besides 'play everywhere' needs a lot of improvements imo.  I'm using Amazon Music btw.

"I have two 1st gen Dots which have been slow in responding lately, so I decided to buy a new 3rd gen Alexa Dot on November 28 (Black Friday).  I keep checking my order and Amazon has yet to ship it.  Is the brain behind Alexa getting slower?  Is everything at Amazon getting slower?"
So usually I don't have any issues but yesterday and today alexa isn't exactly working. I'm asking for a song but it tried playing a Sirius radio station and then when I specifically said the song and artist it played a station from like Pandora or Amazon music. I have apple music as my default service. I finally got it working by saying play the song using apple music. Am I doing something wrong?  I thought I could just say play the song and it would default to Apple music.

Recently I bought a Tuya Smart IR and set up my humidifier to work as a fan (I did it to have more functions on the control).  &amp;#x200B;  But I can just turn on or off the device! In the Tuya app I have a lot of others buttons. Is there some way to use them? Does anybody know what are the commands that the Tuye uses in the Alexa?
I am trying to solve the lack of independent volume co trolls for different activities. So far I have successfully created a routine that when I say “Alexa Broadcast” it will set the echos volume to 10 and drop in on the echo in my daughters room. The problem I am running into is the opposing routine I have created “Alexa End Broadcast” refuses to trigger and the drop in remains active and does not change volume back to 4 and hang up.   Any insights as to how I can make this work?
Hello. I was just sitting in my room watching James Charles makeup video with Jojo Siwa when out of nowhere my Alexa turned on and started playing Jojo Siwa songs through amazon music!?!?! Can anyone explain this!?
Or do I have to configure each device one-by-one?
"Me: ""Alexa, set a reminder for 9:00am for to ... (Check downstiars)""  Alexa: ""Setting an alarm for 9am.""  Alexa: ""When is this reminder for?""   Me: ""9am""  Alexa: ""What time is this reminder for?""  Me: ""...9am""  Alexa: ""Okay. I've set a reminder at 9am on 9am for ""9am"". I will remind you at 9am about your reminder.""  Me: ""No, alexa. cancel the reminder.""  Alexa: ""Okay, cancelling your 9am reminder at 9am for ""9am."" Is there anything else I can do?""  Ugh."
"Hey, guys! I’m super new to this. Just got my Echo Dot (4th gen) three days ago, so I imagine it’s just something stupid I’m doing.  I made a good morning routine, where Alexa was supposed to lower the volume, say good morning, tell me the time, what’s on my calendar, the weather and lastly, play a spotify playlist. It worked correctly once, but after I added the time to the routine it doesn’t work properly anymore.  Basically, Alexa says good morning and tells me a cool fact, and instead of telling me the time, she plays a song called “what time” on Spotify. The same thing happened when I tested only with the weather, it started playing a song called “weather in Paris” or something like that. When I tried just the calendar, she asked if I wanted to play some song on Spotify. I deleted the routine a few times, changed names, changed triggers and everything, but Alexa always plays a spotify song instead of doing what’s supposed to. And all my other routines with actual spotify and smart home triggers work properly. But anything with what time is it, the calendar or the weather doesn’t. Although, if I just ask Alexa for any of those things directly it does work. Just routines with that don’t.   So what am I doing wrong here?   Thank you!"
"I've seen some videos lately and almost all of them have the word ""alexa"" sensored. What is the reason for this?"
We have our Christmas lights and inflatables all plugged into a Amazon Alexa plug on normal on/off time based routine.  Anyone know of a way to set up something to where if the wind speed is currently higher than say 5-6mph it can turn off the plug?   Almost lost a couple of my babies the other night due to high winds and would love to automate this.
"Hey Everyone,  I don’t know if I’m going crazy or if I just can’t think of the appropriate words here. All I’m looking for is perhaps a garage door opener that will trigger a routine or some kind of garage door motion sensor that will trigger a routine. I want all my lights in the garage to turn on when the garage opens.  I can’t find any Alexa enabled garage door openers that seem to have the feature written out and all the sensors I’ve found require a hub or security add on of some type. Any suggestions for something that will work with Alexa out of the box?  Thanks everyone!"
"Okay, this is bizarre and unsettling...I am going to be super detailed.  I seriously didn't know whether to put this here or the paranormal reddit lol     We have Alexa devices throughout our house.  Occasionally we'll get a random delivery ding, but they're otherwise well behaved.  Last night when I got home from work, my wife and I were sitting in our living room discussing our days.  The tv was turned down low, the house was quiet.  In the living room is an Alexa device; five feet from where we were sitting.  Adjoining the living room is a large dining room (no Alexa) and adjoining that is our kitchen (Alexa Show).  There is 20 feet and two walls separating the living room where we were seated and the kitchen Alexa device.     As we were chatting in the living room (point of reference, you cannot hear conversations in the living room from the kitchen) Alexa in the kitchen starts sounding like it is having a conversation.  WTH?  Right?  So I get up and walk towards the kitchen when it starts to play what I would later learn was a song called ""Sad!"" by XXXTentacion.  (Another point of reference, I've never listened to the artist and have certainly never asked Alexa to play him or his song).  I told Alexa to ""stop"" and it did.  I returned to the living room, ""Well, that was bizarre.""  And laughed it off.  I really figured it had glitched or something.     So, as I'm laying in bed last night, I found myself thinking about it.  And then the thought hit me, ""The app keeps track and records whatever triggers Alexa.""  So I pulled it up.     Sure as shittin' there was a recording of a voice that said, ""Alexa play Sad"".  A song by a dead rapper about suicidal thoughts.  Super.  Here's the really creepy part; the voice sounds like me.  If you played the recording without the preceding events and asked me who was on the recording, I would have a hard time denying it was me; except, you know, I've never uttered those words to Alexa...or anyone for that matter.     I called Amazon this morning and the rep's response was, ""Oh no, no, no.  Nope.""  She thought it was creepy too.  They are ""investigating"" and I haven't heard anything back yet.     After the call, I decided to do an experiment.  The recording has a lot of interference in it, so I decided to wake Alexa from various distances and locations.  Afterwards, I would play back the recording.  In each of the experiments, the recording was crystal clear.  I even woke Alexa through an exterior door from the porch and standing a few feet from an exterior window; crystal clear.     Anyone have any thoughts?  Have my devices been compromised?  Do I need holy water?"
"Is anyone else having problems with Alexa executing motion sensor-based routines?  We have sensors in three areas that we rely on.  Two days ago they seemed to stop working for an hour or so early in the morning.  Yesterday they were fine until the evening (when they are most helpful).  Now, twelve hours later they still aren't working.  I've verified both in Alexa and SmartThings that the sensor is actually reporting movement (and temperature).  Because the affected lights aren't in SmartThings, we can't easily create automations to test.  In Alexa, I've created some test routines but they also don't execute.  Tapping ""run routine"" or giving a voice command work flawlessly so it isn't the lights.  I've also tried scanning for ""new devices"" in case something wonky happened there (wouldn't be the first time).  We detect no other internet/network-related issues.  I'll probably call Amazon in a few hours so they can say they're sorry and tell me to uninstall everything, reset my network, yadda yadda.  We've been lucky that we haven't had this sort of thing happen in the eight months since we began doubling down on smart home (except Sengled door sensors which, frankly, suck)."
"Is there a way to change the saved WiFi network for all one's Echo devices at once?  I have to do it one by one, and it often does not work. The best way is still via the web interface, but even that often fails on the first try.  Why is there no option to update all devices at once?"
"I thought that this would be kind of a staple item, but I can't find a fully compatible Alexa waterproof or water resistant speaker anywhere. I think I found one by JBL and that was it.  By fully compatible I mean it can do everything that an echo dot can do not just serve as a microphone for the Alexa app on your phone like many of the ""push to talk"" ""Alexa"" compatible Bluetooth speakers are.  Has anyone seen anything like this? I'm shocked that the market isn't flooded with options."
"If you go to Best Buy’s Alexa skill, you can get a boat load of them for dirt cheap.  Need to link your account but it only took me a few minutes"
"Hi,  Seems like my country doesn't have Apple music integration with Alexa. Is there any way too circumvent this limitation? Thanks!"
"As the title says, my grandmother resides in Germany and I am US based.   Do I need an echo show to video call with her or am I able to use the Alexa app instead?"
"For some reason, I can't actually find one that suites my needs. The best I've found is [mycookboook.com](https://mycookboook.com) and it's far from perfect, even in the paid version.   I want to be able to open the skill, open a recipe and ask ""How much salt"" or ""Next instruction"".  I need to be able to add my own recipes.   Ideally, it would also have a web-based meal planner.   Mycookbook sorta kinda works. It has a meal planner, but that isn't part of the skill.   I CAN request directions or ingredients, but I can't ask thinks like ""how much salt"" and when she reads the ingredients, she reads the whole list. Also, the show she is running on seems to go to sleep after a few minutes.    I really wish this skill worked better.  The site has some rough edges, but it has a chrome extension to scrape recipes and the meal planner is good. The Alexa skill? Not so much.   Right now, the best I can do is open Firefox on the show and just use the web-based version. Works ok.   Any suggestions appreciated."
"Hello   Forgive me if this a repeat post but as I'm sure you can understand, typing 'and' into the search box wasn't very helpful!  I'm looking to come back to Alexa from Google Home, but have just been trying a few things out.    Should I be able to stack a pair of commands using the word 'And'?  I tried asking Alexa the following: ""Alexa, turn off the living room light and turn on the landing light"" but it couldn't understand.  I have follow on mode enabled and asking in that format DOES work (""Alexa, turn off the living room light..... turn on the landing light"").   If it makes a difference, they are older models - but they are freshly set up so I assume the latest version of Alexa.  I couldn't find an option to update in the app.   Any ideas?   Thanks!"
"Myself and my partner both have a Spotify Duo account. We have a Sonos system at home, where we can each connect to the Sonos directly through the Spotify app. Simply click in the bottom left hand corner, select the Sonos speaker, and you can play your music.  I recently bought an Echo Dot to add to a bedroom and it doesn’t have this sort of plug-and-play functionality. I don’t know a whole lot about it so just looking for answers. It seems like only my phone will connect in this way to the Echo Dot. When I look through my phone I can l click my Sonos or Echodot and it plays, no problem. My partners phone will **not** play though Spotify though.  My intention was to use this speaker in my Baby’s room to play white noise &amp; music but it isn’t practical if we both can’t connect to it. Other than that it would be uselful if anyone on your wifi network was allowed to connect to the speaker, so if you have guests they can use it too so long as they are on your wifi network.  Questions are:  Do we both need to be using the Spotify account linked to Alexa?  Is there any way of syncing our accounts if this is the case (we already have Duo)?  Is this a glitch, and if so, can we work around it?"
"Hi there. So I prefer to avoid wifi and apps as much as possible, instead opting for Zigbee (with the exception of Amazon devices, which I trust to be secure and allow wifi access).  So I was excited to find that the ""hub-required"" Sengled Lights could pair directly with my hub-enabled Echo Pro and skip all that Sengled app/hub nonsense.  So I then went to buy a Sengled switch. It's like a little remote that magnetically connects to a cradle. I would like to control lights in the same room as the switches.  I was successfully able to pair the switch without installing the app by clicking ""other"" for the brand. It's now paired, but I don't see any way to associate it with the lights. It seems to think the device is something to push commands _to_ rather than it being something that sends commands, which is what I want.  Is this a limitation of the Alexa home system, or am I doing something wrong?  Thanks."
"I connected two Phillips hue light bulbs to my Echo Dot and everything was great for several days. But now each time I turn on/off or dim the lights through voice command, they work perfectly, but Alexa says they're not working and I should check the network connection and power supply. Again, they function perfectly, but it's really annoying that Alexa keeps telling me they're not working. I've disabled and re-enabled the lights. Do I need to fully remove them and start over? Any thoughts? Thanks."
"It was working perfectly fine earlier today, but now when I say “Alexa” it does nothing. I tried to plug it out then back in and that didn’t work either. But when I plugged it back in, there was none of those blue lights at the top like there ussually is. I’ve check to see if there on the same WiFi, which they are. Anything I can do to get it working?"
"Hi everyone! Couldn't find my specific answer from searching, but I just recently bought am echo dot (3rd gen) and I have a couple of [Govee RGB light strips](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Govee-Changing-Segmented-Multicolor/dp/B08149FMTG/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;keywords=govee+rgbic&amp;qid=1606676309&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-6) in my room. I was wondering if there was a feature to let's say dim my ceiling lights (Wifi smart switch activated) to 50% and turn my rgb strips to the ""rainbow"" preset. I know my alexa can't connect to my light strips but can it connect to my phone or even just by bt to the receivers on the strips? '  If this has been answered before, I apolgize and ask that you just link it in the comments if possible.   Thanks in advance!"
"I've created a household with my partner's Amazon account. We switch profiles pretty often on individual echo devices to try to keep our music preferences separate. However, all of the lights (via Caseta switches)  are in my account and unless an echo is switched to my profile, Alexa will not turn lights on or off. Is there a way to make the lights and other devices accessible from all profiles?"
"So my grandparents want an Alexa. They want something they can use from their bedroom and living room. Do they needs to buy 2 separate Alexas, or is there a way that they can use one in two different places? Sorry if this is a stupid question, I am not very tech savvy."
I’ve read all about how people have set up a movie time routine so that they tell Alexa to dim the lights and turn on Netflix and so on. But what about when the movie is over and you want the lights to go back to normal brightness? Do you need to set up a second routine?
"1. My notifications are INCREDIBLY loud. Much louder than I have each echo device set. I have no clue why.  2. I keep getting notifications asking if I want to order more of something, despite definitely having this feature disabled in the app.  Is anybody else having these problems? Do you have any solutions?"
Pretty much as the title says. Trying to help a friend but im not too familiar with Alexa.  They just wanted a cheap solution to turn off their lamp and I gave them a spare outlet figuring their Echo Show would be able to detect a zigbee plug but theyre having no luck.  Any workarounds or just buy an alexa plug from Amazon?
"I can't seem to understand how Alexa operates on Spotify.   I can ask her to play playlists and she will find great results and play them and then she will ""pretend"" she can't find anything.   For example I could say ""play electric guitar chill"" and she finds nothing, though if you would search yourself you'd find billions of options.   Anything I can do?"
any ideas?
"I remember when Echo first came out, they were trying to ease people's concerns about a microphone in your living room listening 24/7, and they were very open about the design: There was one very lightweight embedded computer that JUST listened for the word 'Alexa', and when it heard that, it would then power on the rest of the system. It was basically designed to be impossible to listen continuously for anything other than the key word.  Well, now we have all these other devices - thermostats, microwaves, Echo Show, mini's, etc etc.   Do they still have those safeguards? Or have we just let that idea go?"
"Is there a way to connect my fire stick (older generation) to my echo studio, in order to play sound from the tv? I don't have a smart tv. I did try to set up ""home theater"" through the alexa app, but my fire stick doesn't appear as a device, even though it's on the same wifi network."
"We have a fire tablet on the wall in the mudroom to check the time and weather on the way out and yesterday as soon as I got in the room it started speaking about how we're low on apple sauce and would I like to order some more. WTF? I mean, I guess that would be a cool feature but I didn't ask for anything, it just noticed I was in the room and asked?"
"Has anyone else experienced slow wakeup with the 4th gen Alexa. After saying the wake up word it usually take Alexa about 3 seconds to recognize it start listening for commands. I never had this issue with my second gen (and still don't). It always wakes up straight away. Interestingly enough if I power cycle the 4th gen, the wake up will be lightning fast few a couple of hours and then will revert to be really slow again after a while"
"I live in a second floor apartment and have multiple LIFX bulbs and Kasa smart plugs being run by my Alexa Dots (3rd gen). I'd love to find an inexpensive button or doorbell that will work with Alexa as we don't have a doorbell. It would have to be battery powered as I cannot drill holes. I've looked at many online (ring,eufy,smartthings,etc) and can't find just a simple, inexpensive button or doorbell that works with Alexa. Most that do fall within my budget (&lt;$100) require a subscription, or a seperate hub. I'm willing to pay a bit more for video if it will use my existing cloud storage (google drive, dropbox, etc), instead of subscription-paid storage. Anyone have any suggestions?"
Is there anything like this anymore? I found the echo button that looks like would do what I want but I don't see them available anymore. Anything similar that would work to start a routine with the push of a button? (To control lights without having to talk basically in a room without a lightswitch)
Does anyone know how to set a timer when to turn away lighting off while still in guard mode. I’m on a trip right now and don’t like that my lights were on all night and didn’t turn off until the morning.
"I’ve had an Alexa for a couple months now and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to connect it to our fire tv. In my Alexa settings she’s connected to the same WiFi as my tv, but it also always says that the device is offline. The communications section says “network error - tap to retry” but when I tap it just continues to say the same thing. What am I doing wrong? As often as my kids lose the fire stick I’d love to turn the tv on/off with Alexa but so far no luck. (I do have the fire tv app on my phone but that doesn’t allow for turning on/off)."
"I have bunch of devices linked to the main account (amazon, TP-link, Philips hue, etc) and then I added a new account to Alexa. It's working fine and I can switch between devices via voice commnads. However when I try to turn lights/switches/plugs/etc on/off some do not work.  How do I get the second account able to access all the linked devices the first account has?"
"I basically just want to set up a routine that will turn on lights on lights if motion is detected on a blink mini for example and turn it off after a set amount of time if no motion is detected.  Is it worth me just picking up a echo (4th gen) with the zigbee hub or getting a samsung smartthings hub(the guys over at smart things subreddit appear to jumping ship)  I want something basic I don't have hours to learn something like home assistant and I want to have as few hubs as possible to reduce clutter.  Currently I have the following devices:  Alexa -  Alexa Echo Show 8 - kitchen  alexa dot Clock (4th gen) - bedroom  alexa echo (2nd gen) - Front Room  2x alexa dot (2nd gen) - spare room &amp; garage  Lights -  2 Sengled white bulbs and hub - Stairs and spare bedroom  3 novostella rgbw bulbs - Bedroom, Front Room, Front Porch    Led strip for above and below kitchen cabinets plugged into a smartlife plug (not bought yet)   Planning to buy some ikea bulbs for the kitchen, bathroom, garage.  plugs -  4 smartlife plugs - Led Strip, lamp, office lamp, garage 4-way  other-   Nest thermostat"

"For the holidays I use smart plugs to control window lights. Worked great the first year I had them but two years later I have constant problems.   I took them out yesterday. I have some TanTan plugs and assorted other smart plugs. I have, after much difficulty, gotten them connected through the TuyaSmart app. Previously if I connected them through that app- I had no problem getting them connected in Alexa.

"Hey guys.  I'm a convert from Google Home.  My wife and I have used GH for years for our shopping list.  She and I can both add to the shopping list and access the list via [shopping.google.com](https://shopping.google.com) webpage.  We're trying to accomplish the same thing with Alexa, but I can't figure out how to add her or what she needs on her phone to view/add.  Note that I did look at other third party solutions like Our Groceries and Todoist but didn't see one that was optimal.  My wife isn't going to remember to say 'Alexa **ask Our Groceries to** add beans to shopping list' and Todoist seemed to lag in syncing the shopping list.  This could pose a problem as we sometimes are adding things while the other person is at the store.  I'm not against third party, but it would have to use the default add function and be fast at syncing.  Any help is most appreciated.  All the best to you!"

"Been on the Echo environment for a few years now, but I still can’t believe the simplest of things Amazon just refuses to add or fix. They’re are by far the most out of touch with their customer base.   1) TIMERS: why can’t I ask an echo in another room “how much time is left on timer?” Which I set on the kitchens echo? Always “no timers set” unless you ask the echo you set it on. This makes no sense to me. You also can’t cancel a timer. But once the timer is going off, it doesn’t seem to matter which echo you talk to, it will stop it if you ask it too. So this is deliberate on Amazon’s behalf.   2) ECHO CLOCK: this also revolves around timers and alarms etc. why does the echo clock only display the timer from one device? My clock is in my living room, but if I set a cooking timer in my kitchen I get nothing on the clock. — only if I set the timer in my living room. Simple Fix Amazon refuses to do.   3) why is it so complicated to do simple things like stop music from playing? I’ll be watching tv and The trigger word will be said, then it opens Apple Music and starts playing music. You’d think “stop music”, or “stop playing music” or even “turn off music” would stop it — nope. You have to specifically say “stop playing Apple Music”. Again, why complicate it? “Stop music” is stop music.   4) this brings me to their limited options for wake words since it’s inception. I have a daughter named “Alexa”, I also watch Star Trek a lot; and anyone that knows that show knows having “computer” as a wake word is a no-go. What’s left “echo”, “Amazon”? Both don’t sound native to speaking to something. It’s actually why I choose Amazon echos over Google home at first. “Hey Google” sounded so unnatural to start a sentence with. “Amazon, what’s the weather” or “echo what’s the weather” just sounds ridiculous to me. Why does Amazon refuse to add more wake words? This is something I’ve seen asked for for years by a huge number of users, or why not allow us to record our own wake word? It recognizes our voice and words already, so how complicated is it to allow us to record our own? but once again all this falls on deaf ears at Amazon.   5) finally, in regards to their screen equipped echos, like the spot and show. What’s the point of having a 8” screen when the clock is always only using 20% of it? Then of course Amazon refuses to allow anyone to turn off their “have your tried...” and other screens they force you to continually scroll through. Yes, I have disabled all the rotations and disabled the screens they allow me too, but it won’t just display what I want it too. I want a clock on the screen all night, so when I look at it, I see the time, not “hey, try saying ‘call mom’” or say X to see all the things you can ask me to do. Once again, a highly asked for thing to be able to do, yet Amazon refuses.   Some of these things may not apply to you, or maybe they just don’t bother you; but the question remains, what’s so hard about doing these things? Why does Amazon force stupid things on us we don’t want; why does Amazon refuse to make their products work together?   The “try saying...” screen I know why they won’t get rid of, it’s because they collect voices and responses from us and use it for their algorithms and probably other data collection purposes. I’ve turned off any and all sharing of my voice to Amazon. But why they won’t sync their products together is beyond me.   Anyways rant over. I think I sorta hear my kitchen echos timer going off; who knows, I can’t tell from any other echo in the house, or the app on my phone, or the app on my watch."
"Hi. I had a question and I don't know if it's been answered here yet but, I have 2 roommates and I was wondering how I can add their profiles to my alexas and connect their devices to my devices.   It used to be really simple in the app but now I can't find it and I'm very confused."

Also, when someone rings the bell, I want to be able to communicate with them through Echo Show 8. I purchased Blink XT2 but it has an almost 10sec delay which makes it useless for my purpose. My criteria are the follwoing:  \- Work with Alexa - Echo Show (preferably trigger Alexa and automatically show the front door when someone press the ring button - I don't want to ask Alexa to show me the front door, I want it to show automatically once someone presses the button)  \- Has package delivery detection and notify me if a package arrived, however, if someone pass through the monitored area or if some of my household move around the door, I don't want to receive any notification (is this possible at all?)  \- Not require wiring  You help and guidance is greatly appreciated."

Also posted last night, my two new large round echos, you have to ask it twice for anything, dam thing/s are deaf as shit, and also often gets many things wrong....  EDIT : Just went into fire tv cube settings, and deleted sky from the equipment, now it not showing to set it up again...  What the hell is going on with amazon....Is the USA outage affecting us here in the UK ?? If this keeps up for over a week, the lot will be going on to ebay, and thats me done with any/anything smart for my home ( or not so fucken smart  any more)"
"I've used the default routine schedule that Amazon provides in alexa, but I've added a song before all the rest, ""Time - Alan Walker Remix"" it plays the music on spotify as requested but then all the other commands are not responding"
I noticed today when someone rang the doorbell that my Echo announced some one was at the door.  I thought that was weird as i’ve never linked my ring and Amazon accounts... I was surprised when I noticed my Hue lights had added themselves as well.  What gives?
"I’ve got a first gen echo which I only use as a bedside device. It’s too ‘bassy’, even on low volume when it’s beside me and I don’t need that. I’m considering ‘downgrading’ to the new Echo Dot 4th Gen and gifting my old echo to someone else.  It's only used for alarms/routines, weather, news and podcasts to sleep to.    My question is, what’s the difference in sound quality between an original echo, and a new echo dot 4th gen?   Any advice?"
"I wanted to set a “good night” routine, but everyday I need to wake at different times, so i didn’t want to set a standard alarm, it would be great if Alexa could do it. Anyone knows if I could? Google does it, I believe Alexa should to.   Besides that, is it possible to insert a custom command on a routine? Like, set a phrase as I was saying that to her"
"Music doesn’t seem to work, she’s unresponsive and doesn’t talk back. I’ve restarted all of my devices and the internet twice."
"Okay - My girlfriend &amp; I have separate Amazon accounts, each configured with our own phone numbers --- I can tell Alexa to switch accounts but when we tell Alexa to make a call, it looks like the call is coming from MY phone --- is that because of a configuration issue, or because Alexa is making calls via a generic Internet connection that is linked to my number - or is it something else?  ---- the concern here is that recipients of the GF's calls might not pick up if they are tagged as being from me (not that I'm some weirdo, just that I'm a unknown caller)"
Maybe I’m just overlooking it but is there a setting in which allows me to slow down the Alexa Speech Speed when sending an a text announcement from phone.  Half the time she reads the announcement off so fast you rarely catch the whole thing especially if you’re not ready for it.  I’ve gotten around that sort of by double spacing between each word but it still just as fast.
Trust me.
Alexa seems to have a lot of trouble this morning doing basic tasks.  Is yours also?
Our alexa is plugged in to the right of us and i always turn to look at her when talking to her. 😅 Maybe its to make sure she actually worked... She does like to ignor me sometimes. 😂

"I have a dot 3rd gen and I got a dot 4th gen on sale and i wanted to report that it sucks.  The audio quality compared to the 3rd gen is hollow and tinny and about quarter the volume of the 3rd. All in all stay with the 3rd if you want good audio. I'll keep it since the sound isnt particularly the focus for this one I wanted one in my bedroom for controlling the house, i put my 3rd gen in the living room for jamming to music"
"This wasn't am issue at first, but now whenever I'm in the room with my alexa it's like my phone volume doesn't work. In other rooms/out of the house it seems fine but in this room it's like my phone is muted. The alexa doesn't play the sound from my phone either? I have an echo dot, any help with this would be really appreciated!"
My kids like to watch themselves on cameras. Can they do this on the Echo Show?
Can you pair the two? I can’t seem to figure it out but I’m also new to Alexa. I can’t find anything about it on google either so figured ask reddit.
"After multiple Google searches I haven't been able to find quite what I'm looking for, which is weird because I can't be the first one to have had this question.  I'm trying to program an exercise bike routine where each timer goes off at 5 minute intervals. Right now, I'm just doing 5 minutes at a time any commanding the next one once the previous one ends.   This is fine - and I know, first world problems - but since doing it this way offsets my routine by few seconds at a time I would like it to be a little more precise. Is there a way to program or routine the way I'm looking for, or is there a skill that accomplishes what I'm trying to do?"
"Hello,  I've had an echo dot for a while and had no issues but lately I can't hear Alexa's response. I can ask to set a timer and a timer is set and I can hear the alarm go off but her voice is never audible. The light ring around the top still looks to be functioning normal.   Thanks!"
Hi! I’m trying to replace some locks on my new house and I have no idea what the best system may be as I seem to experiencing some analysis paralysis at this point. Any help all you knowledgeable people are willing to provide would be much appreciated!  I would like to replace my front porch lock and front door lock at the very least. At most I would like to add an additional smart lock to my back gate and back door. I will post some photos for reference. I have Alexa set up in the house but also have Nest products for the thermostat and smoke detectors and what not. Not married to any one system.  The main issue I run into with the front porch lock is I am not sure if there is a system that will work in the footprint that the current lock exists within. Particularly on the back side of the lock which has a metal box around it. (See photo)  https://imgur.com/a/XWlp8eL/  Thanks for any and all help!
"Hi,  I have encountered a weird issue. I have a routine set up to go off when an alarm is dismissed.  My alarm is set to play AC/DC at 7am, however I am noticing that as soon as the alarm goes off the routine triggers. It does not wait for me to dismiss the alarm.  Has anyone encountered this?  I went as far as doing a factory reset and creating a new alarm and routine, still same issue."
"On the Alexa app on my S9 Android my Alexa app opens, and works until I try to use the back button. Not only does it not go 'back', but nothing in the app works after I hit the back button.    I uninstalled / reinstalled, restarted phone - same issue. Ideas?"
"I just got the Sidewalk email that says ""When enabled, Sidewalk uses a small portion of your Internet bandwidth to provide these services to you ***and your neighbors***. This setting will apply to all of your supported Echo and Ring devices that are linked to your Amazon account.""  You can disable this feature using the Alexa app.  How much of a concern is it that unknown strangers' devices are on my network?"
"Have you heard the goldfish story yet? We asked Alexa to “Tell us something scary”, and it rambled for 5 minutes about this man who couldn’t shake the idea his goldfish was watching him. And then the story just... abruptly ends. No resolution. Just a goldfish that is always watching.  My wife and I can’t find anything online about this story. No references to it, let alone an explanation as to what it was actually about.  Weirder still, we aren’t seeing any records of this action in our Alexa app.  Does anyone have an answer!? What is up with the goldfish!?"
"Hi there. Is it possible to lower the notification volume? Our new Dot 4 is set to 20% overall, but when she plays a notification she is too loud."
"Rather than follow Amazon's email each week, lets try putting the entire month together.  [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-october-2020/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-october-2020/)  Let me know what you think"
"I bought two 3rd gen Dots from Best Buy, for $18 each.  Each came with the new Sengled Smartbulb that doesn't require the Sengled app, it connects to the nearest Dot directly (Well, theoretically).  These are my first Smartbulbs.  I can't get Alexa to find these darned things.  I turn them on, they blink a few times, which I assume means they are in pairing mode, and walk through the Alexa set up on my android phone app.  When it gets to the finding devices stage, it blinks the light again, which I ASSUME means they've been discovered. But at the end of the find stage, it returns, ""No Devices Found"", and indeed they are not in the device list and cannot be controlled by Alexa.  I've tried multiple times with both bulbs and have even unplugged all other Alexa devices to make sure the bulbs only try to connect with the device I want.  No Go!  Could the Firestick devices be a problem?  The bulbs were free, so I don't feel cheated all that much, but my trust in Smartbulbs, in general isn't very high right now.    Anyone else have a successful experience with Sengled?"
"Hi there,   my setup is 2 Echos and 2 Sonos Speakers. All devices are registered to my account. My wife is part of my household in the Alexa app and we have the Amazon Music Unlimited family plan. Both our Music accounts work fine on our respective phones.   Now if my wife starts music through Echo, music will be played via my account. If we use ""Switch profiles"" beforehand, it will be played through her account.   We both already went through ""Learn my voice"" and we are both being correctly identified via our voice, so the distinction is possible.   Is it intended behavior that the Music accounts don't get switched? Because Amazon says that through voice profile recognition, Music gets personalised depending on who uses it."
"I have a software phone client on my laptop that allows me to use my work VOIP line through the VPN.  While I'm teleworking, there may be times that I'm in another room for a few minutes.    Is it possible to have Alexa listening for that ""phone"" to ring, and them alert me via broadcast?"
"I'll be using the one showing the time, will it work when it's not my wifi but a public one? Thanks"
Just found out that there is an Alexa app for Android. Have downloaded it 3 times now but it will not set up. When I open the app is just says that it cannot connect to the service. This has been going on for hours. Any suggestions? I have a Pixel 3 xl. Thanks.
"Lately, if I have a routine set to turn on a light, but ramp the brightness over time, that light won't turn on and any other actions that follow it in the routine won't trigger. Anyone else experiencing this?"
"So, I have my new Studio Paired with my FireTV Stick 4K. It works brilliantly, except  I have two things which are annoying me.  1) Everytime I play something like music ""alexa play rock music"" my TV turns on. I don't want that.  2) For some reason, I can't use my Senn Wireless Headphones, connected via optical cable any longer in preference to the Studio. Most of the time I use my headphones, only when my wife isn't in bed yet am I using the speaker.  I suspect it's because the Optical is connected to the TV, and the Studio is paired to the FireTV."
"I have 4 Google Minis in their boxes that I've gotten for free over the last couple of years, If Amazon can't rein in the Alexa spam I'm happy to switch to Google and cancelling Prime as well. BTW everything in my notification section related to Amazon shopping is disabled."
"I’m watching someone’s dog and they have an Alexa, it was pulsing yellow and now I’m wondering if that means they were listening in? Now it stopped pulsing yellow"
"I have been trying to set up my daughters with voice profiles, but Alexa can't tell us apart. My kids are 11 and 15, so all our voices (and even our accents) are quite different, and Google Home can easily distinguish us. However, Alexa now thinks we are all my oldest daughter.  How can I train Alexa? We have all re-done our voice profiles several times to no avail. The option in the app to match voice profiles always responds with ""No profiles to match. Come back later to match more recordings with voice profiles."""
Thanks!
"I have 3 speakers setup in my ""everywhere"" group -- an echo dot and 2 different gens of echo show. Very often, audio will stop playing across the two Echo Shows and will start to only play out of the echo dot, while still be registered to the ""Everywhere"" group -- it seems like the only resolution is to switch to one of the speakers as the output, then switch back to the ""Everywhere"" group, at which point it begins playing across the full array again.  &amp;#x200B;  Has anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions for how to fix this?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks in advance!"
"I have Hue lights throughout my home, but I have one Lifx bulb in my family room simply because it’s brighter. I set up a Group in the Alexa app that includes both my Hue lights and my one Lifx bulb. Works great when I do a voice command: “Alexa, turn on the Family Room.”  All the lights come on. But I cant get it to work with the Alexa Routine I set up for the lights to come on at sunset. Only the Hue lights come on, not the Lifx bulb. Any suggestions?"
I'm seriously about to replace my Echo with Google home.  I already have brief mode turned on.
"Hey,   &amp;#x200B;  I am planning to do the switch from alexa to homepod but I still have some alexa lightstrips in use.   Is there any way I can turn them off when I trigger my homekit leave routine (I can still have my alexa plugged in) without saying anything to Alexa? Like if the light x is off turn light y off too?   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks"
"When I try to turn on/off lights, Alexa is constantly asking ""did you mean X?"" It's not 100% though. If I make an effort to speak very clearly and face the nearest echo, sometimes but not always it will go through without ""did you mean"". I read in another thread this could be related to device grouping but I have no groups. This happens with ""study"" and ""bedroom"" quite often so it's not related to a single name either. Any suggestions? It's a bit maddening.  ""Alex turn on the study"" -- ""Did you mean study?"" -- ""Yes"" -- ploink  ""Alex turn on the bedroom"" -- ""Did you mean bedroom?"" -- ""Yes"" -- ploink"
"Lately, Alexa can’t seem to respond to a query without adding some damn suggestion or “did you know...” after.   Listen, you infernal machine: speak only when spoken to, answer the question, and shut your trap!"
"I have a bit of a dilemma... we have a prime account, with a secondary adult account attached. We have a ton of smart devices...echo, smart plugs, smart bulbs, cloud cams etc that all connect to the secondary account. To play prime music from the echo devices, we have to be on the main account. When we are on the main account though, everytime we try to control lights and such alexa always confirms. ""Looks you are trying to use something from another household account, should I control the foyer for you?"" It works, but it is just a pain to go through everytime.  My options as I see them 1. Downgrade the primary to a regular amazon account. Upgrade the regular Secondary account to prime account. I dont know what all repercussions are here when it comes to content like books, videos and such.  2. Deregister all the smart devices from the secondary account and register them to the primary account. This will require me to recreate all of the routines, rooms, device names. Ill probably have to reconnect them all to  the wifi.  3. ???  I'm leaning towards option 2, just because I don't fully know the repercussions of option 1.  Any advice or other things I should consider before making a move?"
"I have the SmartHQ app and my GE Profile washer and dryer connected. The app has Alexa skills enabled. However, all the commands are telling the appliances to start or other functions.  I want the washer and dryer to announce, through Alexa that the wash cycle is complete or the dry cycle. They appear as devices in Alexa, but they are not listed when trying to create a routine.  The SmartHQ app sends notifications to my phone so there has to be a way, but I cannot figure out how. Thanks for any ideas."
"Hi guys,   Ive just got the new Alexa Echo and want to use it for my laptop speakers as the speaker is so good. Ive plugged a line in cable (Headphone jack to echo cable) that didnt work and I didnt know the phrase  there is to connect the line in cable?   Or failing that, How do you connect it via Bluetooth? It just comes up with a code which obviously i cant enter on the echo?   Any idea? Thanks,   Tidyboy"
"I just got an echo dot to listen to audiobooks from Audible, I have linked the correct account and my books appear in the Alexa app. I ask it to play a book and it says ""Getting your book from Audible. You have X hours and y minutes left in this title"" etc, but then it just doesn't play it. Does anyone know how to fix it?"
"Hello! I have an issue with my alexa that I haven't been able to get resolved lately. I recently moved to a larger home, so I added two more Ring devices. I now have my original doorbell plus another doorbell and a spotlight cam. My issue is that no matter which door there is motion or a doorbell ring, Alexa always announces that it is at the front door, ignoring the fact that on the Ring system and the Alexa app I have one listed as front door and another as back door. So if there is someone that comes to the back she announces it as front door. Any advice?"
Has anyone noticed degraded music quality when using a multi room music group lately? When I play a song through Apple Music on one echo it sounds fine but if I play it on a group of speakers it sounds noticeably worse. Almost pixelated and heavily compressed. I didn’t notice this previously. Anyone else seeing this?
"I’m trying to figure out which smart lock to purchase for my new house. I purchased the Ring security system along with an Echo show 8 &amp; 3 during prime day.  From what I have read and based on looking at the Ring list of compatible devices, it appears the Zigbee version would be the correct choice. The reason I am asking is because it is unclear why the WiFi version would be incompatible considering the WiFi version states it is compatible with Alexa. I also like that he WiFi version is also compatible with home kit, plus it is $50 cheaper right now at Best Buy. Thanks for your input!"
"Can the Echo Show 5 detect motion and act like a security cam? Either record video to cloud, or alert on motion detection?"
"I'm thinking of getting an Alexa for voice controlling my TV, but I only have basic cable coming in via a coax cable. With a smart TV, is it possible for Alexa to go to those channels with voice commands?   For example: ""Alexa play channel 2."" or ""Alexa go to channel 4.""  Is that possible or can Alexa only control content on like Netflix or Hulu? Thanks."
 Basically I’m a huge logic fan whenever I ask her to play young Sinatra 1-4 she either plays warm it up can’t find it or just shuffles random logic songs

"I use the question of the day app and when I say, ""Alexa, start question of the day."" it works fine on two of my 3rd Gen dots but one of them opens a search on my Firestick for some weird movie name. When I open the app on my phone and check the voice history, it registers exactly what I said. Why does the one dot do something else? The echo that acts up isn't even the one in the same group as the Firestick. Anyone have any ideas what's going on and how to fix it?"
"I don't have amazon music or anything so it's not like I use the function anyway, but my mom keeps putting it on these radio stations that play Latino stuff and it's super annoying.

"I’ve set up my Echo Show 5 in a bedroom to replace a digital clock and an Echo Dot. When I ask it to turn on/off the light, the display defaults to a screen showing me the brightness of the light. Is there anyway to stop it from doing this, and to return to the clock/home screen?"
"So I bought recently an Echo Dot 3, it's working great so far but I'm having this little issue where Alexa doesn't record who I am or neither my wife no matter how many times we try to do so by the command ""Alexa learn who I am"".  There's a way to fix this?"
"Hey,  i have a door sensor who is integrated into alexa via smart life.

"I got an alexa video call from my mother today, and I answered it on my android phone. When I switched to another app, the call disappeared, and I can't figure out how to return to the call.

"Ive seen a few similar posts but im still not able to work this out.  &amp;#x200B;  I use Home Assistant and had all my stuff exposed, decided today to clear that up so blocked all HA devices from Alexa scanning, cleared all devices via [alexa.amazon.com](https://alexa.amazon.com) and did a rescan. Excellent, just 62 devices down from 300+ :)  However, im finding several devices that dont exist being picked up as ""unresponsive"". Under the about section of that devices in Alex it shows ""Connected Via = Hue Hub"" and Description ""Royal Phlips Elections smart device"".  &amp;#x200B;  I dont have anything in the HUE app that matches the names im seeing in Alexa, so where are they coming from? I really dont want to have to reset the Hue Hub, i just want rid of these ghost devices.  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: Just realized these are likely old emulated hue devices that i guess the bridge picked up and stored."
I wish there was a feature where I say “Alex add ingredients for chicken casserole” and it would add all the ingredients to the shopping list. I would already had set up a recipe and listed the ingredients on it. It would be so convenient for me.

"I have just bought a second Alexa Echo for upstairs in my house. Setting up the first Echo was fine after a few tries but I can't get this second Echo to connect to the house wifi.

"Hey folks, I just turned on my echo dot 4 today and it's neat, unexcitingly, I got it so I could just tell my roomba to clean stuff if I make a mess rather than going into the app. I have ordered about 6 smart plugs and 8 smart bulbs as well. I figure I put a bit of money into it, I may as well go full on.   My first question is related to smart plugs. Are they just a variac? Meaning when I put them in and label them for Alexa, is it just ""this voltage goes into the plug when I say"" or do they have an interface to deal with things like vaporizer settings? I'm assuming it's just ""power goes here when I say"" but it's still brand new and reality hasn't set in to what SciFi has promised me.  My second question is about the lights. Can you set ques? Can I make Alexia flicker the bulb, or pulse it if I so desire? Like could I set a ""date night"" keyword, and then have the bulbs go yellow and red and bounce between the two automatically, or will each change be a different keyword?  Any super interesting items that you took a bit to find, that has improved your smartphone we experience significantly? Any tips of setting up these routines or skills, whatever those are?  And lastly, if I can change the response to a specific prompt? For instance, if I say ""Alexa, set the mood"" I would rather not hear this bored voice saying ""okay, I have set the mood"" to kind of pull me and my partner out. If it needs to respond, one word or at least a whisper would be beneficial. Maybe change the audio to a different voice or plays a file I choose.  I know these questions seem weird, but my google Fu has failed me on them. And again, big expensive purchase, I'm excited, and don't want to be brought down about my purchase by hunting through forums and complaints.  Thanks!"

"Whenever I tell Alexa ""Order product x"" she adds it to my cart, but in the US store, not in the Canadian store.  She knows where I am in Canada, gives me proper weather etc, and all of my devices are set to English/Canada.   The other weird thing is if I ask for for local movie listings she says ""Sorry, your Amazon account is registered to the United States""  Every other localization feature works, and I get notifications (yellow light on Echo Dot) of Prime deliveries so she is liked to the right account.  How do I get her to ditch her affinity with the US Amazon store?"

"After adding another adult to my amazon household, they do not have any of my connected devices shown in their alexa app. Further, commands spoken to their alexa app is not recognized by our connected devices. In order to add the connected devices to their account, I’d have to reset all of my devices back to pairing mode, taking them off of my alexa app.   I assume this is not working as intended. We have two smart lights (sengled wifi) and one echo speaker. We would like to have both apps function fully from eacg device, is that not possible?"
"It's worked fine for years. Now all of a sudden I'm unable to switch to my account from another household on either my echo or dot.   I was able to deregister device and login that way. But then if I switch to wife's account - I can't switch back. It just says - ""Sorry I'm having trouble please try in a little while."".   Makes no sense.   It's nice to be able to switch accounts as all the smart home stuff is on my account and music unlimited on wife's."
"Also no longer answers ""Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about?"" as well as ""Who is the man who would risk his neck for his brother man?"" These questions used to be answered accurately all the time. One of my favorite Alexa tricks, gone for no reason."

I have 2 Echo Plus and have a Bluetooth device that outputs audio from my projector. I can Pair perfectly the Bluetooth to one of my Echo devices. What I would like to do is that the second Echo device plays the same thing as first one. Just like when you make a group of speaker but this time using one as the Bluetooth receiver. Any clue?
Lately every time I use my echo either the one in my bedroom or in my kitchen even for simple things like just asking what time it is Alexa after answering me will then go on like a minute and a half explanation of some weird feature that I don't really have any use for and I always have to tell her to shut up. It even did this the other morning when I was turning off my alarm it just started saying did you know you can and then started talking about some sort of feature.
This seems like a dumb question I know.
"I'm using an Echo show as my computer speaker. But every time I turn on my laptop or switch to watch a youtube video, it wakes  the connection and Alexa just has to announce **""NOW PLAYING FROM LAPTOP (DEVICE NAME)""**  I don't need to know this every time!  Especially has it also plays a little connection tone! (which I also don't really need!)  Same goes for my phone; if I say, ""Alexa, connect to phone"", I will hear it audibly connect with a little tone, but then it says **""NOW CONNECTED TO (DEVICE)""!!!**   I don't need to hear this!  By far the worst though is if it doesn't establish a connection within a few seconds, Alexa goes into a soliloquy!  **""I DID NOT FIND A DEVICE TO CONNECT TOO. TO ADD A DEVICE PLEASE GO TO YOUR BLUETOOTH  SETTINGS AND SEARCH FOR ECHO \*$-%£""!**  OMG! I don't need to hear this, ever!  but it does it virtually every time. And then halfway through the does make the connection after all, so switches to the **""NOW CONNECTED TO (DEVICE)** message!  I assume I'm pretty effed up because I posted on this before and it seems to bother no one!  How in the millions of users does this just not drive many people batty?  And how have Amazon not changed these settings in all these years?!!  Or is there some simple way I can turn off  these stupid bluetooth announcements? (**PLEASE!**)"
"All,     I'm sorry if this is common knowledge already, but after struggling with this issue for the better part of an hour and finding zero answers through Google, I figured I'd post the solution I found to benefit those that need it.  For folks that are having issues getting Alexa to play a specific personal playlist as part of a routine command,  in the routine menu where the actions are listed, select the action meant to play your playlist and change the naming convention to: ""playlist name"" playlist. Ensure you have the default settings for your music library set to the streaming service of choice (Spotify in my case).  If I'm just technologically inept please feel free to ignore this post, otherwise I hope this can be helpful.     TL,DR: To get Alexa to play specific playlists in routines, change the action name to ""playlist name"" playlist and make sure your streaming service is set to as your default selection in Alexa's settings menu."
Anyone use the gen 4 yet?  How does the speaker/mic quality compare?
I want to buy an echo dot but it not being wireless is very inconvenient for me. Is there anything I can do to make it wireless?
Booting up a specific song from within a created playlist via spotify  🤔
"I have a few z-wave devices controlled by Alexa via the smart things hub. I think the smarthings app is absolute shit. It forgets devices, won't include/exclude, and is generally just poorly thought out. poorly designed, and poorly executed shit.   Anyway, I was wondering if there is another z-wave controller that I can use with Alexa."
The top ring of the Alexa is flashing an orange light. What does this mean and how do I stop it
"Hi all,  Simple Java app, calling a http endpoint and reads the results. Something I worked on during lockdown for some fun. https://github.com/1i/ebirdus . [Link to Alexa skill](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08LVX99MT)  Provides sightings of notable/rare birds in Ireland and the UK provided by ebird.org/explore Ebird.org have amazing resources full RESTful Api and Postman docs &amp; collections to play with. Works for counties and capital cities of Ireland and UK.  Would you have something in your morning Alexa routine, after it reads the news you get bird sightings in your area? What other features would like? Search for recent sightings? ( I wonder about bird names being very uncommon in english and if Alexa could actually understand them) Would you give an Alexa app your location so you didn't have to say your region?"
Hello I have an Echo Show and the Dashboard rotates between my background and either a recipe or news. Is it possible to find a list of those specific recipes or news articles? I don’t need all of them just recent ones as I’ve missed a recipe’s name twice and I can’t seem to find it and I can’t ask her either.
"I get the notification on my phone from the amazon app and wondering if its possible for alexa to pick this up and tell me, should I miss it on my phone."
"Hi all! Hope you're doing well.   Well, I'm sure you've noticed now after years of existence that our favorite virtual assistance has a big issue with recognizing correct input sources.   Namely, when she hears her wake word when she is in the middle of speaking, she, well, wakes. NOW, this is not a problem and is indeed the desired behavior in most cases. But, the problem exists when she herself is speaking.  The wake interrupts the flow of whatever I'm listening to - thankfully, Alexa recognizes after a second that I'm not speaking to her, and resumes whatever she was playing. Still, it's a bit jarring.  Should notes and training be included with the materials supplied to content creators, advising them to avoid using the most common wake word in their content? Should something be done with Alexa's software to avert this issue - a way to let Alexa know when something she should be listening for is actually coming from her and should be ignored totally?   Or is this too big an ask, and the programming of the recognition algorithms now too complicated to make such adjustments? Would be interesting to know more.  Thank you all for your input; have a great day!"
"So I'm at a complete loss here as I just purchased a 2 Samsung TV's, a 65 inch and 70 inch series 7 and they are both the 2020 models:   UN70TU7000BXZA    UN65TU7000FXZA    I have two Sonos Beam's setup to each of them with Alexa enabled.  I am able to turn on the TV and voice control however I cannot turn off either TV with Alexa.  I am able to click a button on my phone via smartthings to turn the TV which leads me to believe there has to be an outlet to tell alexa to turn the TV off but I don't see anything on IFTTT, webcore, or any other service anywhere to do this.  I have to be missing something because clearly there is a way to turn it off if I can click a button in smartthings from another country that can turn my TV off to get Alexa to turn the tv off.  Note I do not have a harmony remote or hub nor plan to buy either."
"I have had a echo flex running a routine to turn off my garage lights after no motion is detected for 5 minutes. This routine has worked flawlessly for 5 months. However, last week I noticed my lights were not turning off. Ive removed everything and re added devices and routines but it still doesn't work. I created a test routine to play a sound when no motion is detected for 1 minute and not even that works. Motion DETECTION routines work fine and ive come to the conclusion that amazon released an update that broke Motion NOT DETECTED routines. Has anyone else noticed this?"
"As I said in the title… Whenever I ask something, and I really only use it for weather, math, music, really mundane things like that, she will then pipe in with some other stuff that is irrelevant. I can’t find the setting to turn this off. Any help is appreciated."
"I'm having an issue with the Alexa App/Echo Auto. When I am playing anything through the app, whether its radio, an audio book, or music, once it starts playing I cannot get it to stop. I will say ""Alexa, Stop"" and it will top for about 3 or 4 seconds, and then resumes playing.  The issue persists even if I go into the app and press the pause button. The audio will stop playing, then without any input from me will resume playing again. I'm at my wits end with this. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Troubleshooting I have done so far: Reinstalled the app, also started over from scratch. Factory reset the echo auto and forgot/repaired everything as though I just bought it brand new."
"Last night, everything worked fine.   Now, the Plus in my main living room responds with ""Hmmm I don't see any smart home devices."" Lights and devices respond to some other Echo devices (dots in other rooms), and control through the app on my Android works.     I've restarted the Plus in my main living room, with no help  Normal commands work on some Alexa devices.  All Alexa devices show up and appear normal in the app.  I've verified that I'm on/using the correct ""account""  Further testing:  On the Show I have in my kitchen, when I interact by voice I get the same ""Hmmm I don't see any smart home devices etc."" response, but when I use the screen, all devices show up, and I can touch to control (on, off, varying dim amounts) all of the smart home devices I can see or hear.  I have an Echo Plus (with hub) and a Philips Hue hub, two ecobee thermostats, two Echo Shows, and a collection of Dots.  When I test with ""Alexa, turn on dad's light"" I get:  Plus: Hmmm. I don't see any smart home devices (etc.)  Ecobee 1: works  Ecobee 2: Hmmm. I don't see any smart home devices (etc.)  Kitchen show: Hmmm. I don't see any smart home devices (etc.) (but control from the touch screen works)  Bedroom dot: works  Bath dot: works  Garage dot: works from some devices, but not for others  Workshop show: Works for some devices, but not for others. (but all devices show up and can be controlled from the touch screen)  I've confirmed the wifi is working, and the signal strength is strong at all devices. Both Shows indicate good connection strength to the wifi.  I've restarted the Hue Hub I also have, even though I'm not really sure it's controlling any of the lights.  This is very odd.  &amp;#x200B;  What's the next troubleshooting step?"
"I've found a trick that seems to clear up a lot of Alexa device name recognition problems.  I've got a light on the left side of my room rather uncreatively named ""left"". Occasionally Alexa just seems to refuse to recognize it.  I'll ask it to do something with left and it tells me ""nightlight in hall does not support that"", which is kind of odd because I don't have any devices named anything remotely like ""nightlight"". Or it tells me ""there is no device named lamp"". Sometimes ""turn on left"" and ""turn off left"" work but attempts to change brightness or color think I'm trying to change ""lamp"".  When this happens it is usually persistent, although sometimes the ""no device named lamp"" can be fixed by standing next to my Echo Dot and saying very loudly ""turn on left"" and really emphasizing the ""ft"". (And no, it isn't that other noise is distracting it...this can happen when the room is quiet).  I've found a simple thing that seems to fix all of this. I just do a ""turn off all lights"" command. After that, everything is back to normal. I can turn ""left"" on and set color and brightness again.  (I use ""turn on &lt;name&gt;"" or ""turn &lt;name&gt; &lt;color&gt;"" or ""turn &lt;name&gt; to N%"" rather than ""set"" because I have a reading light named ""read"". I found that ""set read to 50%"" would sometimes be interpreted as a command to resume an audiobook. I've never had it do that with ""turn read to 50%"")."
How do I ask Alexa to play a radio station for 2 hours in a one sentence request?  I can do it in 2 separate requests but how do I ask in one request?
I have an Alexa skill where I query a s3 bucket. But I'm unsure if it's possible to upload a file to s3 from my echo show.
"My cable company supplies us with a streamer that does most stuff a streamer does, just an android TV running android 7.0 and with their own skin (which I can easily change with a launcher, but who's counting)  &amp;#x200B;  So, I recently invested in 2 amazon echo dots, since smart home stuff is cool and I like to geek with it, and it's been working pretty well so far. I have an rgb strip that works really good, and my normal light bulb is both rgb, I can control the brightness and I can turn it on and off.  But I have a problem. My sister watches both normal cable, and uses netflix on the TV, and also the TV has a ""vod"" function. basically another streaming service provided by them with mostly local, or normal shows that air on TV, like stuff from NatGeo.  I believe that won't be controllable since you probably need a special alexa skill for that, which doesn't exist. But is there a way I can tell my tv to go to netflix (on my androidBox, and not a fire stick) and maybe switch channels without the remote?  Turning it on and off needs an AR blaster, so i'll probably buy the Xiaomi universal remote since it's cheap and should work for turning it on and off."
"I get the message, Amazon: Alexa is for you. It's not for me. Practically free, so I'm the product. So many mistakes, bad humor, impertinence, and ""helpfulness"" just highlight how UN-intelligent it is. A machine wishing me ""have a nice day"" repulses me in a particular way. Or maybe it's just its tone.  So I'll put the HomePod mini and Echo Dot 2nd gen side-by-side to see what their strengths are, and I'm sure I'll find thing to dislike about HomePod.  How do folks run different assistants? Is it a free for all, or do they get different jobs? Or do people transition whole hog?  My primary uses are:  * Timers and alarms * Shopping list, to-do list (funneling to ToDoist) * Time/date/weather * Music from Spotify * Units conversions and simple math * Turn devices on and off (half dozen outlets), adjust Ecobees  THANKS!  And by the way..."
"Hi everyone. I have about a dozen Hue bulbs. I had a load linked using my Echo Plus Zigbee link. Then bought a Hue starter kit which finally gave me a dedicated Hue Bridge.   I started the Hue app and added some bulbs to it and it pre loaded the few it came with. I then synced to Alexa. I’ve found that since doing that if I add a bulb to the Hue app it removes it from its old sync on Alexa (fine) but doesn’t replace it with the Hue name or functionality.  Any advice? I could do the whole lot on Hue, bin Alexa and Hie link and then restart it from square one on the Alexa app by resyncjng Hue. My concern in having to do this every time a get a new bulb.  Is there a way to force Alexa to sync with the Hue app?  Thanks everyone!"
"The 3rd gen Dot is unobtrusive and, with adapters, can be mounted vertically and horizontally, and in fancy holders, without losing its low profile.  Does anyone see themselves mounting a 4 gen Dot directly on the wall or over an electrical outlet the way so many 3rd gen users do?  I'm willing to say that the new design sounds a tiny bit better; however, I already connect my Echo to my stereo system via Bluetooth for the significant upgrade sound that offers.  But I question if that small improvement in the 4-gen device is worth the reduction in placement flexibility.  I have no complaints about the larger 4 gen Echo device, they have always seemed to me to be shelf or desk top devices, and the increase in sound quality does sound significant in them.  But people buy Dots for one reason and the tabletop Echo for another reason.  There is too much convergence in form and functionality in my eyes."
"Just got an Echo and I am wondering if there is a way to set up Alexa to do the following:  I want Alexa to tell me   (number of minutes until 1am beginning from when I ask the question)/5.  I know that I can ask Alexa: Alexa, how many minutes until [TIME]?  And then I can take the answer to the question above and ask Alexa: Alexa, what is [ANSWER FROM PREVIOUS QUESTION] divided by five?  What I want is to automate this entire process with a simple command to Alexa, like a shortcut.   Can someone give me some pointers on how they would do this? Is this possible? Is that what Blueprint is for?  Thank you."
" I just got and Fire HD 8 7th Gen, I'm from Mexico so I got it from ebay. I can change the languages settings but Alexa remains in english, I got the response in english. The language option in the settings is missing so I don't know what to do. I don't mind Alexa talking to me in english, but my routines are not triggering, since the phrases I use are in spanish, so Alexa does not understand. Is there a way to bypass this? Even if I can't change Alexa answering in english but at least to be able to use spanish triggering phrases."
Was just wondering if anyone knew if you could connect two Alexa devices to a phone and play your music through bluetooth. I like the fact that I can play through both using my voice but I really want more control in playing my music and would like to use both devices. Thanks.
"I have set Alexa under ""Automatically delete recordings"" to ""Don't save any recordings"". I just checked ""Review voice history"" and there's loads of stuff there.  Did I do something wrong or are Amazon a bunch of sneaky underhanded weasels? (No reason both can't be true, I suppose)."
"I have a roborock S5 vacuum, and for some reason Alexa identifies it as either a light bulb or a light switch but not as vacuum. Has this ever happened to anyone else? Is there a way to change that? I have removed it and added back as a vacuum manually and it just changes back to a light. Google home does identify it as a vacuum. Thanks!"
"Greetings.  Does anyone know why Amazon bothered with Podcasts through Alexa? It cannot play specific episodes on request. Users cannot navigate to specific episodes. And lo and behold, even though Amazon music can link with Alexa devices for music...this does NOT work with Podcasts.  How inept does the team behind this have to be, in order to miss such basic features? And more importantly still...why put into ""production"" a service missing basic, necessary QoL features. This honestly has me considering replacing ALL of my home devices from Amazon, with Google devices instead. At least with Google, I can get improved web searches, and ALL of my entertainment options from my mobile device, played to my home devices.  Lets face it, unless you want to listen specifically to music or communicate room to room, Alexa devices are mostly worthless decorum. I mean, sure, you can control smart devices...but any smart home product can. And it looks as if the alternatives on the market are actually capable of doing something else, too...which is far more than one can say about Amazon's offering."
"So I have three sonos ones upstairs and made a group so I could play music across the whole upstairs. I was able to add all three speakers as preferred speakers for the group, but asking Alexa to play music upstairs only plays on one speaker. If I update the group and remove that speaker, it only plays on one of the remaining two. I'm surprised there are so many issues with the platform in 2020. Google has issues as well"
My family just got an Alexa that we share and playing music I was wondering if since it can be set to recognize our different voices we could set it to default to a certain music service depending on who asks. For example could my sister’s voice saying “Alexa play *song title*” trigger Spotify and my own saying the same trigger the song from Amazon Music?
**Which one of these delivers a better sound? (Prob 4th Gen but I don't own any of them).**
"I have two problems.  1. The notification tone is WAY too loud and I can't figure out how to turn that down. It's significantly louder than the talking volume.  2. I do household sharing, and only the orders made via my Amazon account produce notifications. I want the orders of the other members of my household to also produce notifications. Again, I can't figure out how to change this."
"Sorry if this has been posted before, but I'm trying to find a way to change the verbiage of some skills to make them easier. For example, my vacuum can only be activated by ""Alexa, ask smart bot to start cleaning"", I'd like it to be ""Alexa, clean the floors"". I've tried searching and found something about writing custom skills, but I don't think that's what I'm looking for."
"I understand that Alexa can control Shelly devices, but I am interested in using a Shelly Button 1 to control a smart bulb that is connected to Alexa (through Tuya Smart Life). Has anyone done this?"
I can play music on Alexa from spotify but when I try to play a podcast it doesn't work. I looked it up and its set up correctly and I can't figure out why it doesn't work. When I try to play it from my phone it doesn't see the speakers. Usually it doesn't see any but occasionally it will see one or two. Everyone else in my household can see all the speakers all the time but I can't. Its set up exactly like my parents phones so I dint know what the problem is. Does anyone else know?
"Hi everyone!   we just bought a LG OLED65CXPUA and I can't get Alexa to turn the TV on or off. I want to use the command ""Alexa, turn on basement TV"" but it simply doesn't work. Alexa says ""basement TV doesn't support that"". Any idea how I can make this work? We were using a Logitech Harmony before with our older TV and it worked flawlessly, but now since this TV has Alexa built-in  we rather leave more space on the TV stand and retire the Harmony.  Any ideas? Thanks a lot!"
"I'm sure Alexa is getting the location information, because she gets the weather information correctly all the time.  However, when I ask alexa for the sunset time, she says ""I don't know when the sunset is because your device is not sending me the location."" When I ask her for the sunrise time, she gives me the sunrise time for some weird location in Maine.  How can this be?"
"Lately whenever I talk to Alexa, I get an ad. ""Time!"" gets the time, and then ""any time is a good time for ribbons and bows-"" reminders get similar, so do timers. Or she blithers on about how I can get reminders/status updates on things, or order from the echo.  I just want the answer I asked Alexa for, not all that extra stuff. Is there a setting for that or is it time to play hockey with my Echo Dot?"
Wife wants an Alexa in the bathroom for listening to podcasts and music in shower/bath. Any suggestions for a setup?  I'm thinking about a Flex connected to a waterproof speaker (any suggestions?). Or will an Echo dot on the counter six feet away be loud enough to hear through the shower curtain?
"I'm completely baffled right now.  I've removed all devices within Alexa (as I was trying to troubleshoot removing duplicates and it all got a bit confused), and re-discovering, it is coming up with   1 of my 3 conservatory lights (described as ""Royal Philips Electronics smart device"" despite them actually being IKEA bulbs)  1 other random hue bulb described as Philips Hue Color Light (I have about a dozen hue bulbs)  2 other hue bulbs described as Philips Hue White Light (again, I have a few of those types of bulbs)  &amp;#x200B;  I've disconnected Smartthings and Hue already from Alexa.   &amp;#x200B;  None of them actually seem to turn the lights on or off if i try to switch them within the Alexa app  &amp;#x200B;  None of my other linked smartdevice skills I have connected would contain any of these bulbs ... they would are all devices like smart plugs and heating.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Any clues????   or pointers on how to troubleshoot?  pulling hair out here."
I want to get announcements on my smartphone that were triggered by some of my smart sensors.  Like if I trigger a motion sensor then I can have my smartphone say don’t forget to wear your mask when you leave the house or something.  Is this possible?
Me and the wife make grocery and shopping list. I want to send it via text or messenger but it only lets me send links to the list. While reason I need to send the list is because I keep losing my connection half way through shopping. Anyone have any help with sending straight text only.
"This morning I asked her to turn on a light I have in my front alcove, she didn't execute the command. I sighed and muttered something about stupid bot and restated the command, this time she made the little bwoop noise like she didn't understand or couldn't find the device. Then she suddenly says resuming Amazon music and plays Respect by Aretha Franklin."
"Tipp: If you create routines for Spotify playlists, you can add ""shuffle on"" to the music action to enable shuffle, separated by a comma.  For example add the music action  ""this is the Beatles, shuffle on""."
"Today, ask Alexa when her birthday is. “Spoiler alert, it’s today”. LOL"
"I've got a few Echos and so far I've been using my Android app to connect to them, but I'd like to use Windows.  Problem is, every time I open Alexa in Windows 10, after downloading it from the store, it opens briefly, with a blue screen and the Alexa logo, then closes straight after.  I've tried updating Windows, no joy, I've had this problem for a few months. I've tried deleting and reinstalling, clearing the app data etc. Does anyone have any idea how to fix this?"
"I'm trying to make an audio group of two echo dots, but when I select one, and I try to select the other it says ""Make sure your devices are on the same Wi-Fi network."" They are definitely on the same network - is there anything I can do to fix this?"
"Hello ! I've been looking for a way to disable all sound from my Echo speaker. I know all the commands I want to use, I know they work, and I would like to stop hearing the ding dong from brief mode or the ""Ok"". Is there any way to do this ? Since you can't lower volume to 0... Thanks."
When I ask Alexa to play X song from Spotify what bitrate does she choose? Does she take her queue from what I have it set to in the native Spotify app or web player? Just something I thought about today.  Thanks.
"We have an echo dot in our kitchen and also have a Sonos (with Alexa disabled).  One of the most common things we say all the time is “Alexa, play KUTX FM on kitchen”. This then gets KUTX FM from Tune In and plays it over the Sonos speaker called kitchen.  I would like to create a routine because about 20% of the time it does not hear us properly and we end up with some other station playing.   When I try to set up a routine, it does not give me an option to play to Sonos and it starts playing on the dot.  How do I make this work?"
"So I just got 2 Echo Dots, one for my dining room which will be mainly used by my mom and the other for my room. To make this a bit easier to understand: We all use my dad's Amazon account which has prime, but I also have my own account but its linked to his as a teen account so I get the prime benefits as well. I used my dad's Amazon account signed in on my mom's Alexa app to register the downstairs dot, and I used my account signed in on my Alexa app to set up my dot. The problem I'm having is I want to connect my Apple Music account to my dot, and my mom's Apple Music account to the downstairs dot. I tried signing into mine on my app and into hers on her app but every time it switches on both dots."
"Hello.  Is there a way to get internal Echos sensors data, like from a script or a curl request ?  I couldn't find anything on github or google."
So I went to go order an Alexa for my sons birthday. He has been talking about wanting one for a while and all his friends have one so I thought he would be happy. He was talking to me about one called the 4th generation echo dot. He wanted that one specificity because of how it was a big speaker. But I want to get a kids one that won’t play music as well but I have parental control. Which should I pick? (Ps his friends have the grown up ones)

"Hi all, I hope this is the right forum for questions like this. We just got an Alexa and while my partner and I have tried to use Amazon households, it is very much linked to her phone. Is there a way we can get reminder notifications to either recognise who gives the reminder and send each one to the correct phone, or to send reminders to two phones? Thanks a lot :)"
"I know this has to be here somewhere, because it seems like a major and simple request.  When I use amazon auto to send a text message, it also sends the audio file of what was recorded. This is really really silly to turn on by default because most people (that I know of) don't talk to their phone in a way they want sent to someone (period, exclamation point, talking like a robot to make sure it is heard).  How can I disable the sending of this file along with my text message?  Thank you"
"My house rang out with an incoming coll on my echos, Alexa announced the caller but it sounded like numbers or something, I woke up enough to tell at her and went b and cl to sleep.  But now I'm wondering if anyone else had this happen to them today (election day) or have recieved anything like that recently.   Thanks!"
"I've been trying to put Alexa on a timer for music and I am failing! (Third gen Echo Dot). I've tried, ""Alexa play smooth jazz"" immediately followed by, ""Alexa in one hour stop playing music"".  This doesn't work.  I've also tried, ""Alexa play smooth jazz"" immediately followed by, ""Alexa in one hour, stop"".  And that too just keeps on playing, or sometimes stops immediately.  How would you guys go about this?"
"Is it possible to have all sounds out of my Echo dot play over bluetooth to my speaker, or is it only possible to send media(music) to the speaker, and everything else use its built in speaker?"
"Last night i was playing on the computer and the lights changed colors solo, i ask Alexa to set lights colour to yellow and she changes it to white. The same with most of the colors.  Anyone having the same problems?"
"My apartment building caught on fire and some people looted the vacant building. This is a long shot, but I have it connected to the Megablast app, is there a way to trace it? Sorry if this isn’t the right place to ask. I figured if it were able to trace, it would be through something related to the Alex function attached to it."
"Every time I ask for my shopping list or to do list, my Echo Dot reads out the 5 most recent things and then asks if I want to hear the rest. Is there any way of just hearing the full list as a default instead of adding a second prompt? Using frequent audio reminders is SUPER helpful for the way my brain works, but stopping a lost halfway through kinda defeats the point when it makes me more likely to forget half the list while thinking about the other half."
"All the devices in my household, multiple linked to the family account, and one linked to a personal account, seem to not be playing music. If you ask what song it’s playing, it keeps telling me Bohemian Rhapsody, which was the song I tried to play when this error occurred, even after unplugging and even setting up my Alexa’s again. Any idea what could be happening?"
"I just bought a 65” nanocell LG tv and got everything hooked up. It has built in Alexa compatibility and I also hooked it up to my harmony huh and etc.  The issue I’m having is that the tv doesn’t show as a device I can use in routines. I did some reading and saw this was something they were supposed to add support for last year?  I used to have my tv shut off with my “goodbye” and “goodnight” routines so I could literally just get up say goodbye and go.   I can shut off via normal Alexa commands, just not in a routine.  Anyone else dealt with this?"
"My Echo Dot randomly turns on like every 2 hours it seems, playing music I never even listen to. I have to yell at it to stop or go in the app and turn it off and now today I can't even turn it off in the app. It's really annoying. It even comes on when I'm trying to sleep. How do I fix this? My next step is to raise hell with Amazon and demand a replacement or refund."
"Hi, I am having a problem when I connect my Alexa to my pc, it connects and then immediately disconnects and so on. Is there anyway to fix this?"
"I changed my Google Password and it seemed to break the ""link"" on my Alexa Calendar/Email settings.   After the Google password was changed, I received an error within my Alexa Calendar Settings that I needed to unlink my account and relink it.  I tried multiple times and multiple devices on different apps and each time I choose ""unlink my account"" it asks me to verify I want to do that and then just kicks me out to the settings menu again on the app without unlinking the account.  I cannot do it from the Alexa website. Within the Calendar / Email settings it tells me to download the app to do it there, which, of course, I cannot.   I called Amazon and they tried to get me to do it via the website, but I told them I couldn't do it through the website.   Just thinking I'm maybe forgetting something here. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you."
"In the last year, Alexa's occasional clumsy and unsolicited attempts to get me to buy something on Amazon after it answered an unrelated question were annoying enough. But in the past few weeks this product promotion has increased in spite of my complaints to Amazon's developers and being sure that i've ticked all the boxes in settings that Amazon claims will stop these intrusions: disabled notifications about recommendations and deals, set responses to brief, disabled settings related to hunches.  For anyone who hasn't experienced this, I asked Alexa for the time and she tried to interest me in learning about Halloween decorations. I asked for the weather and she tried to tell me ways I could clean my space.  Although it seems complaints about this just go into a trash bin and users are emailed irrelevant form letters with assurances that this is not the experience Amazon wants its customers to have, has anyone been successful in getting Alexa to stop these unsolicited sales talks? And, if so, how?"
"I know this is going to sound like a big whine but I keep having issues where ""Alexa, turn on the lights."" can take upwards of 20 seconds to actually DO it.  When I use Siri the same request for the same lights happens practically before I can finish speaking the command. It's nearly instant.  What's the deal?"
"Yesterday, I asked Alexa to play some music for me like I always do, but she didnt respond, when I checked the app, I noticed that the skill had been disabled. I went to re-enable it but where the button used to be it just says ""You are not eligible to enable this skill due to geographical reasons"". Idk why it suddenly changed when I had been using the skill for months.  Any tips?"
"I almost have to yell ECHOOOO even though it's within a metre.   Also, is there any new feature at all?  Also, is there any novel use for 2 echos in the same house? Like, having them interact somehow?"
RGB strip won't so the trick.
"I currently use an Echo Plus as the hub for all of my home automation: lights, thermostat, switches, cameras, speakers, etc. But that's *all* I use the Echo for. I have Alexa-enabled Sonos speakers throughout my home which meet my voice-assistant and music/home theater needs.   My router is well past due for an upgrade, and I was looking at the [Eero 6](https://www.amazon.com/Eero-6-Router/dp/B085VM9ZDD/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=ROUTER&amp;qid=1604290630&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExMFc2U0FCNVA1M0syJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTcwODQ5QlFBQlI0MEFYRTQwJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzMDQwMzMyM1RMNUIyNjhLT0dNJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&amp;th=1) mesh system. It works with Alexa and comes with a built-in Zigbee hub. So if I get it, can I sell or trade in my Echo Plus and continue using Alexa to control everything via the Eero 6's hub?  Thank you all in advance."
"Is there a way to adjust the music volume separate from the Alexa volume because when I turn it up to hear Alexa, the music is far too loud. I was wondering if there is a separate volume slider or tweak for this. Thank you."
"Alexa, stop.   Is there any way to get my Echo to stop *by the way*ing me about features?"
"I have both Echo and Echo Dot (3rd Gen) and often when I say ""Alexa"" nothing happens on both of the devices even though I'm very close to it. I was just watching a video of Alexa and Google assistant talking to each other and it was playing very softly from my laptop and Alexa is waking up every single time the Google Assistant say ""Alexa"" even though my device across the room. I've a very deep voice and even my girlfiend is able to trigger Alexa much easier. Both devices are brand new. Is there something I can do?"
Having issues controlling the temperature directly in the alexa app. Now the temperature is no longer getting changed in my routines.
How can I set a schedule for lights to turn on? My lights are plugged into a smart plug. I want the lights to turn on and off at certain times. Example: I want the lights to turn on at 5:00 and want them to turn off at 7:00.
I know that Alexa will pull up recipes from tasty and other popular websites but I’m looking to easily send maybe a note or a website from my phone so I can look at it on my echo show. Any ideas?
"then without even thinking about it....""Alexa: set a clock timer for one hour.""  Worked like a charm.  Now if she would figure out the clock in my truck..."

"Hello,  I like to watch tv as I fall asleep, but there isn't much of a need for the tv to keep running while I sleep. I currently have a ""dumb"" tv in my bedroom with no obvious reason to upgrade. The Fire Stick Voice Remote is limited in how it can interact with the TV (it isn't a pure universal remote). For that reason, I wanted to make a routine that powered the tv on, waited 90 minutes, then powered it off.   It seemed the most logical way to do this would be to automate pressing the buttons on the remote to send the signal. I can turn the tv off and on with the remote, and if I use the voice commands through the remote, the tv turns on and off. If I try to use smart home routines, I get a message that the tv doesn't support the function. I'm not surprised, it's a dumb tv. Is there a way to use routines to automate the button presses through routines?"
i prefer alexa over other assistants. is there a touch screen car stereo that will have alexa natively enabled ? hopefully works off my phones data. i know there is the 20$ car alexa but i would rather have her to control more.
"About a month ago my Echo Show 5 was playing practically anything that was either on Spotify or Amazon Music.  Specially I'd have it play songs by Skull Fist or Enforncer and both played without a problem.   Since then it will say ""Sorry I'm having trouble.  Pleae try in a little while.""  When it worked it would play a certain set of songs by either artists and now it will only play if I ask for a specific song and only if i use the exact words.  For example if i want to listen to Bad for Good by Skull Fist I literally have to say ""Alexa, play Bad For Good by Skull Fist"" otherwise it won't work and I'll get the error message I already mentioned.  How can I fix this?"
"I just learned that the voice recognition on Alexa is basically useless.     I have 2 speakers and 2 people and apparently me saying ""play music"" means she plays the other persons music if it is on their profile, and here I booted all my googles as after getting my first echo it was better in practically every way.  &amp;#x200B;  Like what is the point in voice recognition if the ""profile"" dictates everything, my voice should dictate the context of the action regardless of the profile, if I am speaking use my profile to action my requests, how was such a basic and obvious thing overlooked."
Trying to send grocery list to wife and it’s only sending links to amazon shopping list. Any way to get it to just send a straight list without links?
"Our Alexa always responds better to me and constantly either ignores my wife's requests or just gets them wrong or doesn't do them at all. Anyone else have this issue? My wife speaks loud and clearly at Alexa so I don't think there is any issue with the way she speaks. Just a minute ago she asked Alexa for a 15 minute timer and got a ten minute timer instead. Quite often when she tells Alexa to stop the timer (when the alarm is going off) Alexa seems to ignore her. I tell Alexa to stop and she does it immediately.  My personal opinion is that I've always been polite to Aelxa, usually using pleases and thank yous. My wife never does it. I semi joke with her that Alexa likes me more because of my use of manners and generally being polite 😆"
"Here's a description of how we have things connected - and a couple of questions.    My Amazon Account   My Brother's Amazon Account   My Mum's Amazon Account      I have added my Mum to my 'Amazon Family' so we can share things like Kindle and Audible books.    My Mum lives with my brother, and receives Ring Doorbell notifications from my brother's front door (this is exactly what they want).    1. I also receive Ring Doorbell notifications from my brother's front door - how can I stop this?   2. My Mum also receives Ring Doorbell notifications from my front door - how can we stop this?"
"I have a SmartThings multisensor that doubles as a thermometer.   I can have Alexa read the temperature by asking her ""Alexa, what's the temperature in the *** sensor?"" However, I can't seem to incorporate it in a routine.  Is there an action to be used in a routine that will have Alexa read the temperature from a thermometer/thermostat?"
"Since about the last week or two my Echo Dots have been a lot slower to respond to ""Alexa"" and my Flex rarely responds at all."
"There's a California radio station I like (95.5 K.L.O.S.) and they even say it's available on smart speakers. I'm in Europe and want to listen to it. If I start it Alexa tells me it's not available. I activated the skill on amazon.com and now I get a ""thank you for streaming KLOS"" message but afterwards I again get the not available message from Alexa. Other radio channels (e.g. Jack FM) work.  I can't figure out what the problem is or even if it's a general problem.  Anyone got information what to do now?"
"Okay so somehow my Alexa got linked to their Alexas way back when. It never was a real big deal until the last few months so I never worried about it. My mother isn't the most tech savvy and finally found out how to send voice messages and thinks its the coolest thing in the world \*facepalm\*. so her and my sister send voice messages back to forth all freaking day and it comes through on my alexa too....Also I noticed it started sending everyone's alexa notifications to everyone. I just caught my dad playing the notifications and it said ""(my name)'s package with XYZ has been delivered"" well this item was a birthday present for my dad and now he knows what it is.     How do i seperate mine by itsself so my notifications and such stop going to theirs?"
"This is the whole reason I bought the Show. I just want it to show me who is at the door when my camera goes off, then shut off after a set period of time. It doesn’t seem to be an option. I made a routine that does it but the camera never shuts off. This isn’t an option with my cameras on batteries."
"A lot of times when I ask Alexa to mute my Xbox, Alexa will instead restart the Xbox.  How can I delete the ""restart Xbox"" command?"
"In the Alexa app, I can call a particular echo in my home, which unlike drop-in, requests the permission of whoever is in the room to connect.  I can't figure out how to do this by voice rather than opening the app on my phone.  Does anybody know how? I feel like drop-in is rather rude most of the time."
"I make announcements across my home using echos all the time, and one thing in particular annoys me about it. The announcement also comes out of the echo I spoke to or the preferred speaker for its group. This seems extremely redundant and rather annoying.  Is there any way to prevent this?"
"Hey /alexa! So this morning I added the Rainwave skill to stream some gaming tunes to my Echos. I asked ""Alexa, open Rainwave on Main Area group"" and it started streaming on my 5 main areas Echos. Perfect.  I got a phone call and asked Alexa to pause, now for the life of me I can't get it to work on any speaker group. Was it a fluke? Am I asking it wrong when dealing with skills? I've tried telling Alexa to continue on Main Area group, but it says that isn't a supported feature. Any ideas?"
"Hi, new to whole Alexa and routines thing!   I set up a routine where Alexa turns my light off, and starts playing sleep sounds thunderstorm. The light goes off, then Alexa says welcome to sleep sounds, we hope you enjoy our stream then starts to play it.  If I ask her to play the same sounds out of the routine, she just plays it without an introduction. Is there anyway to get rid of the introduction? It's sounds small but it annoys me.   Thanks!"
"Maybe I'm dense here, but suppose I want to use my phone to tell Alexa to play something.  I can open the Alexa app and go to ""Play"" and do things like ""Recently Played"" which will allow me to play those recently played things on Alexa but I can't seem to use the Alexa app to search Amazon music (not by voice) to find new music.  Within the Alexa app I can go to Amazon Music but that only allows me to find new music and either play it on my phone or stream it to Alexa.  This is not what I want to do.  What I want to do is use my phone to browse music and when I find something new, I'd like to use my phone to tell Alexa to play it.   Am I missing something obvious here?"
"Has this happened to anyone lately?   &amp;#x200B;  Everything was going fine, and I have set my default music player to Spotify in the Alexa app until this morning. When I asked Alexa to play music from an echo, it plays from Spotify. If I choose my preferred speaker (Sonos Amp) it just starts playing randomly from Amazon Music. If I try to force it to play Spotify (i.e. Alexa play music from Spotify) it says Spotify is not supported on the device.      This worked before and I know Spotify is working on Sonos because if I play from the Sonos app I can play no problem. I have tried disconnecting and reconnecting all the skills and rediscovering but nothing. Any pointers are welcome and thanks!"

"When i 1st got my echo, i could say Alexa set light sleep timer for 2 minutes and after 2 minutes it would turn off the lights.

"I have a Garmin speak with alexa in my car and for like the past two weeks whenever I ask it to play a song it’ll get 30 seconds in before she says “That was the last song, starting over.” And restarts the song. I tried googling the issue but it seems like I’m either the only one with this problem or everyone who had this problem figured out how to fix it and I’m slow. I haven’t done anything to the alexa aside from unplugging it and plugging it back in, has anyone else experienced this? I thought I would ask here because reddit usually has the answers and I trust all of you more than I trust Jorf Borzos’s Alexa Support."
"Hi, I've been attempting this for a few days but i my echo dot (3rd gen) doesn't want to communicate with my firestick.

"Yesterday when I asked to turn on the lights Alexa started responding with ""sorry, I couldn't find a device called lights on the echo show next to my bed I deleted everything then readded and factory reset the echo show 5 to default twice.   After fighting with it I tried the ones in the living room and it worked fine. The echo flex in my bathroom is in the same group as the echo and turns on the lights fine. It's only that one echo show doing it. I can use the touchscreen to go into the smart home screen on the show and it shows my lights and can control them fine, it's just asking Alexa that doesn't work.   One solution I saw posted was the add the word ""lights"" to the name of one of the lights but that didn't work. Does anyone have any idea how to fix this?"
"I'm using Harman Kardon Alexa enabled speaker. I've paired it to my Fire TV stick through Bluetooth and also in the Alexa app (TV &amp; Video). Fire TV app and the remote are able to launch the apps if I say ""Launch/Open Netflix"". But through the Alexa enabled speaker it just returns a search."

"Hi all,    My sister in law and her bf are staying over this Halloween and are terrified of the IT film.   Im planning on hiding an Alexa under their bed and hopefully setting a timer to play an audio file.    I was just wondering how I'd go about doing this?    I know I can ask alexa to set a timer to play a song from Spotify or I could play the sound through the Alexa App but this would make a noise before it played the sound.    Is there anyway to turn the sound off before it plays a noise through the Alexa App?   Or   Is there anyway to set a timer to play a sound file as I can't just add it to Spotify?    Thanks in advance."

"My review on Amazon:  Have to say that the Echo Studio feels like a product that’s been rushed to market. The sound quality without the ‘spatial’ setting on is like fingernails down a chalk board. With the setting on it’s... acceptable, but extremely far away from any kind of ‘audiophile’ quality and although it’s obviously capable of going louder than regular Echos, the sound really should be better. Build quality isn’t bad and it feels reassuringly solid. Compared to my other Echos, it’s awfully cloth-eared, too; asking the same thing over and over again until it either gives you the correct info or plays the wrong song just shouldn’t be an issue in the 2020 smart speaker market but unfortunately was pretty much a regular feature on mine. I also take exception at having to reset it most days when it either went completely silent (blue light would indicate that it was listening and answering, mind) or adjusted the volume every few minutes whether I was using it or not. There should also be a more comprehensive equaliser rather than the same bass/treble/mid slider in the app that’s the same as the dots upwards. I just really feel that it’s simply a big Echo with nothing particularly unique or has any kind of stand out element and without the ‘spatial’ setting, it sounds akin to a first generation Dot and that is in no way what I want to spend £190 on. On the plus side, it integrates well with my Apple TV, blu ray player and iPhone (all via Bluetooth) and using it as the speaker for watching films was actually not bad. Interstellar and War for the Planet of the Apes in 4K sounded really quite good, more detailed and wider than I’d expected. However the clipping volume became pretty tiring. By this point I was reasonably certain that it was going back to Amazon but I decided to purchase another to see how the dual set-up would be for film watching. Of course, when the second one arrived, it refused to play ball and after a bit of reading up, it turned out that I’d need to buy a Fire Cube to achieve surround sound, although they would both sync for playing Apple Music- apart from when they didn’t feel like it or one would be noticeably quieter than the other, of course. Ye olde turn off then on again would remedy that. Less than ideal, though. Also at one point, one made a buzzing sound and became completely inert. So I bought a Fire Cube after finding out it had an Apple TV app available on it aaaaaaaand at no point would all three successfully sync up, no matter what I did- either as per instructions or from anecdotal directions from other Echo Studio owners online OR however many times that I reset the three then did it over and over again. This odyssey took around about a week from beginning to end and the Cube was only with me for a day or so before both it and the two Studios were packed up and sent back to Amazon. I’ve cancelled the order for the Sub that would have arrived early December and I’m wholly hacked off with the entire enterprise. This really should have all been absolute clockwork and, y’know, cross manufacturer integration would have been amazing instead of feeling extorted into buying a Fire Cube (which I’ve never wanted previously) just to make both speakers work in tandem for films. Except, of course, they didn’t.  It’s great that a Studio is £100 or so cheaper than an Apple HomePod but I’m reasonably certain that I won’t encounter any of this nonsense when I buy a pair of those.  Don’t recommend."
Has there been any confirmation or indication of when the group calling feature is coming to Alexa? Currently having to coordinate video calls to parents with siblings...
"This has been happening since last week, and across multiple devices. Alexa (and Alex Trebek) cannot seem to understand any answers I give. No matter what the response I say is, it always responds with “you need to use phrases like ‘who is’ or what is’” twice, then the third time it says it can’t understand me. I always respond in the form of a question, and have been playing this game since it became an Alexa skill (my wife and I play every single day), but the last week it has been literally unplayable. I can’t answer any questions. Anyone else experiencing a similar problem? Or better yet, anyone know if they’re looking into or fixing this issue?"
"I just got an Echo 5 to replace a bedside echo dot as an alarm clock. Since I've started using it, it has not sounded the alarm a few times in the morning. The alarm screen will be up, but it will be playing the alarm tone.  It also doesn't seem to hear me very well when I want it to snooze. It will hear, ""Alexa, Stop."" but it doesn't seem to understand ""Alexa, Snooze"" no matter how loud I yell at it. This also an intermittent issue.  Any ideas why it's not working well? Did I get a dud?"
"Ok this is something that has been getting on my nerves as I have to re-add another bunch of devices anyway there is this issue.  I have about 40 odd smart devices around the home, power strips, couple of cameras, some separate plugs, bugger loads of lightbulbs, 5 or 6 echoes. When about half were first setup the majority of them were added using my wife's Alexa App on her mobile, I am on the Alexa household as well and Alexa knows my spotify lists all that kinda crap, so there are two profiles that were working ok. Since then I have incrementally added more light bulbs and just added them using the Alexa App on my own phone. Now at first everything was fine, I could turn them on no problem, but very slowly each of the ones I have added just says 'xxxx light does not support that', I can switch the light on using the Alexa App on my phone no problem, but if I actually try and talk to the echo she seems to have selective memory. The only resolution I have found so far is to just delete the devices and re-add them, which is a pain in the arse.   If it had done this from the start I would've made sure that I added them always with my wife's phone, but they worked ok for a while. Has anyone else had this issue and if so is there any way to actually make it work without having to add it on one profile each time?"
"I’m considering getting a robot vac and i would like to setup a routine for where I leave the house that turns off stuff, sets do not disturb and triggers the robot vac.

I use reminders a lot on my devices. When I first set up the devices two years ago I could ask 'what's my next reminder?' and it would tell me no problem. Now when I ask the same question I get a list of my next four reminders with Alexa only responding to stop about 30% of the time. Is there any terminology I can use to get the time for ONLY my next reminder?
I'm looking for a way to alexafy our gas fireplace. Like most gas fireplaces it uses a lightswitch but theres no electricity there. It just completes the circuit that tells the gas valve to open.   Has anyone done something similar? Curious how If so. Thanks in advance.
"Okay sooIf I’m listening to music on my Alexa at full volume in the middle of the day, I ask Alexa to pause the music and then leave the house.   I come home late at night and ask Alexa to do something... she screams at me at full volume.   Just because I was listening to music 5 hours ago at max volume it doesn’t mean that she should shout at me at max volume a few hours later which wakes the entire house up.   If she is replicating a human or artificial intelligence then her volume should naturally drop to a appropriate level, especially if it’s past a certain time.   Could you create a setting where I can choose an appropriate volume that she naturally drops back down too."
How can I have all of my Alexa devices announce that it’s time for class? Managing several schedules is proving to be difficult and I need something that is programmed to announce throughout the house that it is time for class.  So far I have been able to program Monday through Friday for one time slot on one device but cannot figure out how to make it announce it on all devices.
"Until today, I could turn on scenes and turn off lights just by saying “Turn on/off *room/scene/lamp*”. Today, Alexa started not accepting these request.  “Please, tell me in percents.”, she says.  Maybe, I can understand suddenly losing the ability to set a scene in the preset brightness of the scene. But turning something off always means 0%. “Set Kitchen to zero percent.” sounds peculiar.  Is it just me, or is it an Alexa-wide fail?"
I've seen stuff on various forums that doesn't work anymore.  Is there a way to do this currently?
"For instance, I want to say ""Alexa, today I changed the bedsheets"", or ""Alexa,  remember I bought milk today"". Then I want to ask ""Alexa, when did I last change the sheets?"", or ""Alexa,  on what day did I buy this milk?""  Anybody know how I can accomplish this? Thank you."
"I think I've seen the answer somewhere here before, but could not find it by searching.   I'm wondering if there is a way to train Alexa that it answered from the echo in the wrong room.  This happens periodically.  I thought a saw someone say that there was a phrase you could use to instruct it as such, but I cannot find that phrase!      Thank you!"
Ok I got an echo show thinking it might fix the Spotify problems I had with echo dot. If I ask it to play jailhouse Rocky by Elvis Presley it plays mrs Robinson from Simon and Garfunkel on JAILHOUSE ROCK RADIO. It did not play my playlists but a pure guess worked.I said Alexa what are my playlists and it showed them numbered so I just said play 1 and the first played and so on   If I ask it to play thriller from Michael Jackson it plays beat it from thriller radio. Why is it constantly going to radio stations named after songs   I asked it to play Michael Jackson and it plays Prince purple rain on Michael Jackson radio ?? I’m in Ireland so it’s supposed to be supported. Amazon on Twitter were no help just kept pointing me to their page ..have you linked your acc etc of course I have   If I ask it to play queen radio ga ga it plays Patti smith song on its a kind of magic radio etc  I’m driven demented and I just bought it

Does anyone have an explanation of why it would do this, or how I could correct the issue?"
So we only use the av reciever for audio via optical cable in the back of the TV. Its a old bose reviever and does not have hdmi. Is there anyway to have the firecube turn the volume up and down ? Right now it still plays audio but if I ask the cube to change the volume it changed the TV speakers volume...not sure if its possible but any help would be awesome!
"For those of you who didn't know, the official **Twitch** skill for Alexa is only available in the U.S. Alexa store (and it doesn't really work well). So, up until now, it wasn't possible to play Twitch channels on your Echo devices unless you were from the U.S.  It took us some time to polish the skill, but finally we developed a solution for (almost!) everybody else.  The skill is called ""**Live Streaming for Twitch**"" and it's available in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia.  The skill is as simple as it should be. You name the Twitch channel that you wanna play and - if the channel is live - the playback starts (audio only or audio &amp; video on the Echo Show). If you don't know what to play or the channel isn't live, the skill will give you a suggestion.  A couple of things.  First, thanks a lot to all the beta testers that helped us fine tuning the skill. A few of them came from this subreddit.  Second, we did our best to optimize the speech recognition of the names of the channels. However, it may happen that the skill doesn't understand you. If that happens, let me know which channel you wanted to play and we'll fix that.  Here the links to the skill. Activate it first, then launch it saying ""Alexa, open Live Streaming for Twitch"":  🇺🇸 [U.S.](https://www.amazon.com/Vocalime-Live-Streaming-for-Twitch/dp/B089649PZC/)  🇬🇧 [U.K.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vocalime-Live-Streaming-for-Twitch/dp/B089649PZC/)  🇨🇦 [Canada](https://www.amazon.ca/Vocalime-Live-Streaming-for-Twitch/dp/B089649PZC/)  🇦🇺 [Australia](https://www.amazon.com.au/Vocalime-Live-Streaming-for-Twitch/dp/B089649PZC/)"
"Came home one day last week to the Echo with a purple ring which I looked up and said it was issues with the wifi. Everything else in the house was working fine so I rebooted the echo. After booting I get the yellow ring saying I need to setup my echo. Try to set it up with my phone and but it's unable to discover a new device. I tried turning it off for a day and hit the reset button on the bottom but so far nothing. Anyone run into something like this before?  If it's completely borked is there any chance (i know it's old) Amazon would replace it?  If not, what do I do with a partial functional 1st Gen?"
When I got alexa I gave my family funny names in the app and it was a Giggle but now I want to fix that and I cant find it in the app. Help please
"Hello! So I have a playlist called Tower of god and I keep saying to set an alarm to tower of gos yet it keeps setting it to a radio or a dj or somethinf that I dont want, I linked the correct acc so idk why it wont work for a playlist or song"
So I factory reset my Echo Show 5 (through Alexa app on phone) and went through all the setup process but when it gets to the end of the welcome video it's just stuck apparently loading something.  The Alexa app on my phone shows the device as I named it and in the group I set it to but I can't interact with it.  I used the buttons on top to do a manual factory reset two more times but it still gets stuck on that loading screen.
"My Amazon plug keeps getting disconnected from my WIFI at night. When i wake up in the morning and tell Alexa to turn on the light it says it's not responding. Red light is flashing on the plug, if i turn it on manually, 1 minute later it works just fine. I have other brand in the house that work just fine, what gives?"
"So I asked Alexa to turn on the kitchen light and she replied with ""Kitchen light is not responding"".  After several hours it still wasn't working so I removed it and tried re-adding it.  Alexa found it and it's working again but in the Alexa app when I go onto the light 8t has a different interface to before.  Instead of the on/off button with the brightness slider below it, it has separate buttons for on and off and a load of buttons below for different brightness percentages  It's weird and crap.  All other lights in Alexa show the on/off and brightness slider interface. What's going on?  All bulbs are Philips Hue Bluetooth bulbs."
"And watch this bi$&amp;! play Mellow Folk EVERY TIME. For FOUR years. She's never played modern folk first. She always does Mellow Folk first. Why, Alexa, why?!"
"When I use: ""Alexa Add New Note,"" Alexa takes the command and asks for the content of the note.  Creating the note is smooth (better than creating a Notes folder and adding to it).  I thought I had seen that notes like these were now kept within the Amazon Alexa app.  However, I can'ts seem to find my notes that were added with the syntax above anywhere.  Can anyone shed some light on where Alexa has kept these ""New Notes?""   TIA  &amp;#x200B;  Windows 10 Pro"
Any ideas how to fix this? I have two studios and a cube in the room. TV is TCL roku with roku skill disabled.
"So, a few days ago, during game 3 of the World Series I ask Alexa what the baseball score was, and it said that the Rays had won 6-4. I was surprised the game was already over as I had checked earlier and the Dodgers were up 4-0. I go to bed to find out the Dodgers actually won the game. I then figured out that Alexa had given me the prior game's score.  I have also had a couple times where I ask what the baseball score was, and it told me it couldn't find any games even though it was during a WS game.  I asked Alexa what a few NFL team's records were and it gave me records that were 1 or 2 weeks out of date.  In a non-sports related issue, I had five days of the same news update. I solved it, by getting rid of the Reuters news and going with NPR which I don't like as much because it isn't concise and I don't always have 30 minutes to hear everything.  Yet during this downturn in quality of Alexa responses, I notice that I am getting more and more ""helpful suggestions"" about things I could buy. I really find these annoying, but I have yet to find the right setting to turn them off.  I am getting really close to just disconnecting all of my Alexas altogethers. Anyone else noticing this, or is this just something happening to me?"
"One of the main uses for the Sonos One in my kitchen is as a timer when I’m cooking. If I set a timer when the time is up and the alarm is ringing I used to be able to turn off the alarm just by saying ‘Alexa’ or ‘Alexa 10 minute timer’ to start the next timer. Now either of these phrases pause the alarm and then it just continues so I have to give 2 commends ‘Alexa stop timer’ then ‘Alexa 10 minute timer’.   Is this how it works for others or is there a way for me to change it back? I have tried removing the device, hard resetting etc is this part of an update?"
"I’d like an Alexa app that I can open on my iPhone or iPad that goes directly to the smart home devices I have, much like the Apple HomeKit app does. In other words, the first page is a list or a grid of my devices so I can turn them on/off, adjust them, etc as needed.  Does such an app exist?"
"So I just got the new Echo. When I started setting it up I noticed there is no option for the ""Hey Samuel"" wake word. Anyone get this enabled on their 4th gen Echo?"
"New Echo dot user here.   How do I get Alexa, using the Echo dot and not my app, to list for me my ""followed"" Amazon music playlists and then I can tell it to play one of them? I don't remember the names of all my followed playlists and it's been frustrating to figure out exactly what to say."
"The echo show 5 in my bedroom is bluetooth paired to the speakers paired in my bedroom. When I just tell it to play music, it does so through the speakers as you would expect. However, of I tell Alexa to play music using multiroom music including my bedroom, the echo show 5 unpairs from the speakers and proceeds to play music out of itself instead.  I'm rather confused. Please help.  I should note that these are not alexa enabled speakers, but just simple bluetooth ones."
"I want to set up a bluetooth home triangulation system, and since I have at least one echo in every room of my home, I'm wondering if there's any way they could serve this function.  Essentially, this means I need them to be constantly broadcasting bluetooth (but not a pairing signal, since I don't want random people to be able to pair to them).  Is there any way to do this?"
So I normally hear songs over Apple Music and the name of the artist and the songs are let’s say „weird“ especially to pronounce.  And the music section of the Alexa app is terrible if you are normally using Apple Music.   Coming to my question: is there a way to select my music on my phone and send it to my Echo Dot and it starts playing?  Thanks!
I usually go to bed listening to either rain sounds or forest sounds to of course drown out sounds from a busy house. Early this morning I believed that I heard what sounded like incantations beneath the forest sounds it was so realistic that it gave me a chill and I turned it off and went back to sleep. Later I was telling my wife about the experience and she said that she previously believed she could hear voices but only during the forest sounds. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience or believed that there could be something to this. I dont believe that it is too far fetched for a company like Amazon to do. We know they are listening to us through the devices anyway.
"I see ifttt is reducing their free service down to 3 applets soon. I use one notifies me when a timer goes off in case I'm out of ear range of the device the timer is set on.  Are there alternatives? As an example,  Alexa routines work nicely for getting phone alerts. This is all I want for timers. Had a look in the routines but see nothing.   Maybe a skill? Damn, there are so many silly ones now."
Because I’ve followed all of the instructions and am getting completely pissed off
"I've recently added the Firestick to the TV in my bedroom. I went to the living room and asked Alexa to play spotify, and it keeps trying to play Spotify on the Firestick in my bedroom when I don't have the Spotify App on my TV? How can I prevent Alexa from trying to play Spotify on my FireTV?"
"I just bought the new Echo 4th gen, the one with ""good"" sound.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3  And I'm having a weird and really annoying issue with it, I bought that one because is the only one that has audio input so I have it connected to my PC as a speaker and it happens that after some minutes or hours, Alexa starts to work really really slow, when I say Alexa it takes like 8-10 seconds to respond and the same to whatever I ask after, this issue is related to the audio input because if I disconect the 3.5mm cable OR switch the audio input/output in the app, it fixes right away, the other way to fix it is by  disconnecting/connecting the power from the Echo, does anyone else has the same issue?"
"I’m trying to connect an Echo Dot that I just purchased to my 2 year old Insignia Fire TV. The echo can “connect” to it, but cannot control it. The only device it recognizes is my Xbox, which it tries to default to whenever I ask it to turn on the TV.   The TV shows up under devices and has the correct name, but it’s not a controllable device. Any advice on how to fix this would be appreciated."
"I used to always be able to say ""Alexa, Bedrrom 25.""  and my bedroom would turn on and go to 25% brightness.  &amp;#x200B;  Now Suddenly it responds back. ""Bedroom doesn't support that""  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I now have to say ""Alexa, Bedroom, brightness 25""  &amp;#x200B;  What gives, its just one extra word, but its so tedious."
"**I have a little question.**  Is there a way to control a bluetooh light bulb with alexa?  I have an old *MIPOW* light bulb, which I can control with my smartphone through the *PLAYBULB* application, but I would like to reuse it in my ALEXA ecosystem if possible."
"Anyone else having issues with getting Alexa to play particular music by a specific artist?   Eg, I’m trying to get her to play Paris by Else, she’s been fine playing that song since today. Now, whenever I ask her to play Paris by Else, she replies “Playing Paris by The Chainsmokers.”"
"How do you connect the Amazon Music desktop app to stream to the Echo? I have looked everywhere in the music app, the Alexa app, even my computer.  The Spotify desktop app connects to every echo device I own but under devices on the Amazon music app it just lists my computers speakers."
There are tons of times when 5 seconds is far too long for what I need. I frequently find myself wanting just one or two seconds pause.
"I have 3 Ecobees in the house and 2 of them are in the same room with Echo Dots G3. The Gen 3 sounds much better and gives me access to Apple Music so I want to use them. When I ask for a song both the Ecobee and Echo trigger and attempt to play music.   I want to stop Alexa on 2 of the 3 Ecobees but still be able to control the units via my show. I turn off the mic but the light turns bright red and it just stays on as red.   Any suggestions? It doesn’t seem like you can add Ecobee to a group, it doesn’t seem like setting the communication settings to off in the app does anything. Any tricks I’m missing?"
Is there a way for alexa to do the routines with your account? My voice performs my girlfriends routines instead of mine. Is there a way to make it recognize both sets without changing active accounts?
"No joke, I could not sleep last night and my echo did the blue ring of death out of the blue. It was not responding to me. I unplugged it and plugged it back in this morning. It's working fine now. Pretty weird. Note: the blue ring of death I am talking about is the one where it keeps loading."
"anyone else dealing with this?   I've had both for at least a year.   as of yesterday,  saying:   turn on ceiling fan to 50%   causes Alexa to turn on the goddamned ecobee plus skill and then do weird shit like turn the temperature to 64 degrees for some damned reason,  or turn on the furnace fan,  which at least makes some sense,  though it's still stupid.   I have A DEVICE named CEILING FAN,   why can I not say ""TURN ON THE CEILING FAN"" and have it do that?   I know this subreddit cant help, but just in case someone has found a way to get alexa to do basic stuff like this,  thought it was worth trying."
"Just got my Echo Show 8.  If I start a playlist, I usually like to play a specific song first then have it shuffle the rest of the playlist. Even with the touchscreen, I can't seem to find a way to view the playlist you're playing or that you want to play. Is this not possible? Would also be great to be able to see/adjust the queue, but definitely doubt this is possible if the former isn't possible! Any ideas? :)"
"This of more of a niche scenario, but I’m sure someone here has experience on this.  We have 5 Echoes/dots/shows/Sonos scattered throughout our home. They are all tied to my account. My wife signed up for a year of Amazon music unlimited (individual) on her account.  Is there any way to link her Amazon music account to my Echoes? I didn’t see any option within the Alexa app and would hate to reset each device to her account.   Hope that scenario makes sense and thanks y’all in advance! 🙏🏼"
I am confused on how Amazon echo calling works. It do not appear to be connected to my phone using Bluetooth or even wifi. So what phone line is being used when calling? Also I haven't been able to find if I can use echo to call international and if it will still be free phone call?
"    Hi,  We have three Alexa devices set up in one section of the house for use by my elderly blind mother, who recently had a stroke. Her Amazon account is linked with a phone number so that she can easily call my wife or me. Yesterday I received and installed an Echo dot for use in my hobby room. It is linked to my Amazon account and connected to the same network in the house as the devices on my mother’s Amazon account. Until yesterday, my mother only had to say “&lt;Wake-Word&gt; call &lt;Name&gt;,” and the Echo would call my or my wife’s cell phone. Now, when she tries to call me, the Alexa device responds with “Which should I call? &lt;Name’s&gt; phone or Alexa devices?” I have made no changes to the contact list in her Alexa account. I have disabled drop-in on all Alexa devices in the house. I believe that her Echo sensed my Echo over the network and is now suddenly offering her a choice. As stated above, she recently had a stroke, so making changes to how things work and making them more complicated is not beneficial. Is there a way to get her devices to revert to simply accepting the command and dialing the number?  Thanks,  Lugh"
"Hello all,  Is it possible to run a Routine from a temp sensor? For example, I have a Smartthings temp sensor that Alexa lists, but its not an option for triggering a Routine. I would like to place a space heater in the loft this Winter and when the temp drops below 32, turn the heater on.    When setting up a schedule all I see to trigger are the usual, time, location, etc.    Thanks!  PS - We also have a Nest thermostat."
"I just got the echo auto, and so far I’m loving having along with me when I’m driving.  I can check my calendar, play my news briefing, set reminders, add to to do lists, and add events that will be there on alexa at home when I get there.    I only have one issue so far: because my car is in my garage, my phone connects and disconnects from my vehicle Bluetooth throughout the day.  This has never been a problem because my phone doesn’t usually tell me about it.  But ever since getting echo auto, every time my phone connects to Bluetooth I get a new banner telling me we’re ready to drive.  If I happen to be using the alexa app to set an all devices alarm or reminder at that time, my whole app will go into car mode unbidden and I have to tell it I’m a passenger and start what I was doing again - all while standing in my kitchen, clearly not being a passenger in my car!  These announcements also go to my apple watch when I’m at work and am near the window where my car is parked directly outside in the parking lot.  While none of these things are big; It’s distracting and irritating when it is happening all day.   It seems like my only option is to turn off all notifications for Alexa, but then I won’t get my reminders either, and I really need my reminders to function.   Any thoughts on what I can do?    TL;DR - my phone connects and disconnects from my car Bluetooth throughout the day which makes echo auto continually send me alerts.  How do I make it stop??"
"I have a TEKKIN light and I would like to turn it off automatically every 45 minutes after it has been turned on.  I also want to know, if someone has this brand of lights, if it's possible to associate a remote control to control this light. In the ""Smart Life"" app I noticed that there's ""Lighting remote control (BLE)"" in the ""Add device"" section, but I can't find any type of information about this remote on Google."
So I have Tidal linked to my Echo but I can only ask Alexa to play whatever Playlist I created.    How can I navigate the Tidal App to choose an album or song? I don't like just telling Alexa what to play because I want to be very specific. I want to choose my music through the Tidal app like I'm just using a blue tooth speaker.    Thanks.  I'm sure this is easy and I'm just an idiot hahaha
"Around 1:30am this morning my dog woke me up and she was terrified of something. She's not typically afraid of things, she's not even fazed by fireworks. I went to let her out, and when I asked my echo dot to turn on the lights found that it was disconnected from the wifi. I reconnected the device and after about an hour called her back and she managed to settle down.  I don't know if it was the flashing light, some noise she could hear but I couldn't, or if the echo and her panic attack are related at all. Has anyone else run into this?"
"I currently have an Echo Show 5, and a spare Echo Dot (I think second or third gen).   Is there anyway to make these two devices work together in the same room? For example  * When I say 'Alexa', only one device picks up the command (much like how Hey Siri works if you have an iPhone and an iPad for Eg) * Have them both access the same timers/alarms (instead of separately) * Have them both play music - I've seen this can be done as a stereo set only like for like devices, but not on different devices right? * Any other tips for having two in a room and better integration, would be much appreciated!"
"My roommate frequently needs to know when I'll be done with my classes and meetings, and I do have them in my Google calendar, but Alexa only says when the event starts, not when it ends.  I want them to be able to ask this question in particular: ""When is Logan's next event?"" This would give an answer of something like ""Logan's next event is in one hour and twelve minutes at 5 PM, and will end at 6:30 PM"" or ""Logan is currently in an event, which will end in eighteen minutes."" It would only read for events that are tagged as ""busy"".  Is there any way to do this? It seems all the pieces are there, with Google calendar syncing with Alexa, but I just can't find any way to do this."
Has anyone else experienced this? The music throughout my home plays pretty evenly and it kinda messes with my spatial awareness.
Anyone dealt with this?
You know she has it all documented too.. it’s not my fault she doesn’t listen!
"I'd like to have Alexa's speaker play with my sound bar, my sound bar is already linked to alexa but when I try to put my sound bar into a group it won't let me.  Thank you"
"Hey guys! I'm having problems with my Show 5, the kinda smaller one. The screen isn't always on? Like it sometimes is just black but it's backlit or whatever so I know it's still on. And when I say Alexa, the blue bar on the bottom appears to let me know she's listening but the screen is still black. When it plays music, it shows the Spotify information. And it is on sometimes. I don't know if there's a pattern as to when it's on and off. Is this normal or an issue?   Secondly, I am unable to drop in from my phone. My other device is an Echo, the tall one that's just a speaker, and I want to see the camera (I'm going out of town so I thought I could use it as a pseudo-security camera). Drop in is enabled on the device in the app. When I try to drop in, I get the 3 dots saying that it's attempting the call and then it says that the device is unavailable. How can I address this issue? Could these two issues be related?   Thanks!"
How can I see what routines triggered? This was available in privacy settings earlier this week and now it’s gone. Can’t find anything on Amazon website nor in the app. I need to figure out what routine is triggering after another routine I have set up but have no way of knowing
"On another forum a user posted that we now have the ability to automatically see the live view of our Ring Doorbell (and cameras I assume) when motion is detected.  Create a routine: - When: ""Ring Camera/Doorbell"" detects motion - Action: Scroll down to ""Custom"" and type ""Show (Name of Camera)"".   Then select which device Alexa will use.   I just tried it on my Doorbell Pro and Echo Show 5 and it worked. Haven't really messed with it more but will definitely play with it a bit later to tweak and see if it works with my Ring cameras.  We need a direct setting for this, like how the Doorbell Press Live View currently works, but this indirectly does the job for now."
Also at one point it made a buzz noise then no sound and minimal responsiveness from it. Unplugged it two or three times before it booted up as normal.
"Of course, you don't actually use them very often, but they just look bad to me.  I can't say I love the spherical shape, but I don't mind it. It's just these buttons that bother me.  Is anyone else on the same page?"
"\^Finally got this command working on an Echo dot after lots of trial and error. Now I can stream music from my Plex library through my main audio setup without picking up a remote.  My question is, is there any way to streamline this command? It's quite a mouthful. I would ideally like to be able to tell Alexa ""play music"" and have the Echo dot I'm using default to playing through Plex via the Fire TV. Is this possible???  (Currently, when I tell Alexa to ""play music"" she defaults to playing iHeartRadio through her shitty internal speaker.)"
"I recently moved from Google to Alexa, for 2 reasons  I disliked the wake word and find one word is significiatly nicer and less advertsiey  Second because alexa works better for home automation and my google was getting poor  My only gripe currently is on Google if you put a speaker and one light into a ''room or group. then when you say ''alexa light on'' then it knows you mean the light in the room'' as I see it currently you have to say ''alexa turn on lewis bedroom light'' which is one step forward 2 steps back.  I know you can do a routine so you can do this with the wake word light, but this can only be done once as if another member in another room says it then it would be doing my light.  am I missing something here or am I right in thinking to use alexa you have to remember and say complicated long device names for actions?"

"I want to be able to create loops.  If I have a routine triggered by me saying ""this is a loop"", which causes a routine in which Alexa says ""potato"" and then receives the custom command ""this is a loop"", it should loop endlessly until I interrupt her.  This would be useful for all sorts of things, especially if you eventually add logic statements to routines (e.g. and, or, xor, xand, nor, nand, and xnor). Even without those though, it could still be quite useful."
Have you noticed that Alexa can hear you whisper?  Anyone have any info on the analytics of the privacy?
I'm really looking for some bulbs (Preferably on Amazon Canada) to use for my overhead light.  So I can just keep the switch on and use Alexa to turn them on! Thanks!
"Hey all,   Do any of you have a physical button working to trigger Alexa routines?  Ideally, the button would connect wifi, as my detached garage is far from the house and I wanted to put a button there and the main house to trigger some Alexa controlled lights.  I do have a Hue hub and got a couple of the Hue smart buttons, but I can't for the life of me see where to trigger a routine from it.  Thanks in advance!"
"I have the newest ecobee thermostat with Alexa installed and linked to my Spotify account. If I ask Alexa to play music, turn up/down volume, next song, all of those commands will work. When I ask Alexa to “stop playing music” the device continues to play. I’ve tried unlinking Spotify and relinking it. Any ideas?"
"I have two devices with alarms, a Dot and a Show.   Dot alarm; 0745 Show; 0800.   There is also a routine triggered by dismissing an alarm.   This morning the alarm went off on the 0745 and it also went off on the Show. The routine triggered as expected when I dismissed the alarm on the show, but I don’t think the alarm should have happened on the Show until 0800. I’ve checked the alarms and each says - correctly - which device it’s active on.   Any ideas?"

"Hello! I’m new to Alexa (and smart homes in general). I’ve just recently bought an echo show 10.1 (2nd gen) and from my understanding it has its own motion sensor that triggers when you walk by. My question is, can the Alexa Show’s built in motion sensor be used to trigger routines? I have bought some YoLink motion sensors to work with Alexa but I was hoping to be able to use the Show for one and utilize the standalone motion sensors elsewhere throughout the house. Thanks in advance for any help on this matter."
I have several smart lights/plugs on the network setup on my Alexa. There's a few routines that schedule lights.   I'd like others in the house to be able to change those settings if I'm not there.  Is there any way to do this?
"I want to exclude one Alexa from being able to execute an ALL command as in   ""Alexa turn on ALL lights""  so it just turns on the ones that are connected in it's group and not the whole house is this possible?"
"Hello, all.  Yesterday, all of my smart devices (smart plugs, smart bulbs, TV, thermostat, etc.) stopped accepting commands via Alexa.  My Fire Cube has been stuck with the yellow light as well (despite me even unplugging it and plugging it back in for a reset).  The message I receive when I tell Alexa something is: ""So-and-so isn't responding.  Please check its network and power supply.""  My hub and dots work fine otherwise (i.e. playing music, giving me the weather, etc.).   Has anyone had a similar situation where literally every smart device in the home suddenly seems to disconnect from Alexa?  Any suggested fix short of possibly trying to reset/rediscover each individual device?"
"Basically, I have three Alex devices and sometimesI find myself in one room and ask Alexa to remind to do a conference call, for example, at a set time.

Has anyone else noticed how nearly every post gets downvoted within minutes of being posted?  I don't know if there is just someone brigading or if there is just general toxicity in this subreddit.  This sort of thing pushes people away and makes this subreddit less popular than it otherwise could be.

The command I want is ""Living Room Fan On/Off"" When I make a command to Living Room Fan Alexa response with ""OK here is [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) you do not have permission to perform light command."" The light on the fan will work without a problem but not that fan with voice control. It keeps opening [alarm.com](https://alarm.com). The fan works if you I use the Alexa App. How do I get it to not open [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) when I make this command and instead control the fan. Sorry if this was confusing, its hard to explain."
Let's skip skills that just connect smart home apps. We all already know about those.
"Hi guys, I have a little heater in my bathroom that i use when it's cold in the morning or while i shower, the problem is that once i turn it on it's very annoying to turning it off when its warm enough and re-turning it on when it's cold again. Is there a smart plug i can use also on my alexa with a sort of compatible (or built in) temperature sensor? So when i turn it on with my alexa it will check the room temperature and regolate the power to the heater turning it on and off automatically. Thanks."
"I’m moving to another router but I don’t fancy manually pairing and factory reseting over 15 different plug sockets bulbs etc , is there a way just to do it from the Alexa app?"
"I have quite a few smart home devices in my house, most of them are paired through their associated apps, to which the logins are shared to their individual skills, but how do you do this with things paired to the echo itself?  The other household members are connected to the device and it recognizes their voice profiles, but they are unable to see the devices in the app to turn them on/off remotely/without voice control.  Devices are Z wave paired to the echo directly and not through a separate smart home hub."
"My echo dot won't play any Spotify music at all, everything is connected and it will do any other command including audible etc.  Alexa will say 'playing X on Spotify' and then remain silent, has anybody figured how to solve this?  Thanks :)"
"My kids are young, and their friends and the neighbors constantly blow up alexa. We have a bunch of devices through out the house, and in addition my account is the primary account and I have Reverb on my phone. No matter where I'm at I get the phone calls and its driving me bat shit insane. I did turn off calls on my phone, but I recently replaced my fire tv stick with a fire cube, and now every freaking call comes in to the fire cube. I dont want to stop all calls to the cube though in this case."
I have made a routine on the Alexa app. It works very well on the Eco dot device but not on my mobile phone. What is to be done to make the routine or skill on Mobile phone as well?
Basically the title. Whenever I try in my playlist it plays some related songs but not specifically the playlist. How do I change this?
"As the title says, is it possible and if yes, how? We have the problem, that my Spotify profile is connected with our Alexa, but with my girlfriend working from home, she can’t hear her music from our Alexa music group."
"hi everyone,  i just got my first echo dot and a philips hue bulb. Now I am wondering, if I can trigger my lights on a notification on my phone (android). I already looked into IFTTT but here it seems like it only works in the opposite direction (trigger something on your phone with Alexa). Instead of the Android notification it would also be possible to trigger the lights with an e-mail (as long as there is no huge delay).   I would love to get this working, beacause i am a part-time Firefighter and I get my Alarms on an android App. When I get an Alarm in the middle of the night it would be nice when the lights would turn on automatically.  I read, that the skill virtual Buttons might be a soltion, but I dind´t find out how this exatcly works :/"
I used to love having an old radio and setting an alarm and waking up to NPR or sports radio. Is there a way to make that happen with out first having to hear the Alexa alarm sound?
"I was talking to my wife about how cool it will be for the generation of kids growing up with a close to Star Trek computer like accurate information device. I have a child and I like that she can ask this device millions of questions and get a factual answers. I said I like that a Bible Belt child may ask this device questions and get a wikipedia or accurate answer rather than ""because god""      THEN I asked Alexa ""what is god"" ""who is god"" ""were is god"" and I got no answer     I rephrased this to ""wikipedia god"" and got an answer     Again, ""what is god"" no answer - ""what is music"" answer and I tested this     Do you think amazon went ""ohhh lets not go there"" and programmed it not to talk about the idea of god to not offend anyone? It makes total sense but I want someone else to ask their device in another location than me and see what happens.      Asking the question in a form of direct action like look up the definition of god provided an answer   Asking in the way a child would direct and opaque it just blinks and doesn't do anything   Ask it a question like a child would on any other topic it works     Interestingly asking ""what is satan"" I got a wikipedia entry. So it seems like god is a no go for Alexa, can anyone confirm?"
When I have guard activated I cannot turn it off by telling Alexa I'm Home. She does the usual greeting but no longer turns off guard....
"I just want to kill her every single time that thing say ""now playing from Redmi"" or ""now connected to Redmi""   Google home will just do quick *blib blob* and it's so relaxing"
"Basically everything to do with lists doesn't work on the show 5, though all other devices handle them fine.  Alexa, add potatoes to my shopping list. *That's not something I can do.*  Show me my shopping list. *That's not something I can do.*  Create a new list. *That's not something I can do.*  &amp;#x200B;  Is this a known issue? Is there a fix for it?"
"I have prime. I bought an echo dot for my elderly grandmother under my name. She is blind and has dementia. We live in the same building but basically upstairs and downstairs flats, close enough to be on the same wifi. I can run downstairs to help her anytime but I want to set alexa up so that she can be relatively more independent. I just bought her a Fire TV Cube so that she can turn on the TV through voice command. I want to have two different ecosystems of music/tv/etc playing for upstairs and downstairs.  When I try to make her echo do something (like play from spotify), it basically hijacks my spotify account on my phone. Even if the command came from her phone. I already have a spotify family subscription with multiple profiles. My mother has a bunch of Audible books from 10 years of membership we want to let her listen to. Currently, I and my mother are the two adults on the Amazon Household. I'd like to open my grandmother's echo, make her an account, and log into my mom's audible account on that echo.    Can we set up my grandmother as a ""teen"" on the household with her cell phone, so that she can listen to our shared content and play her own music but not buy anything on prime? I can just buy stuff on her behalf.  Or should we dis-associate her Echo and Fire TV cube from my household altogether and start over with a brand new household through her cell phone? If disconnected households can still do the drop in feature that would be nice but not a requirement.   Any help would be appreciated, thanks."
I’d like to be able to have my phone play what Alexa is playing (one device or multi room audio). Any way to do that?
"With Spotify, it bugs out and stops on half of my echo devices after around 30 seconds. With Amazon music, it goes through 3 or 4 songs before doing the same. All of my echos have a strong WiFi connection. This is incredibly frustrating."
Does anyone using the Windows Alexa app know when Amazon plans to allow you to minimize to the tray??
i have the 3rd generation echo dot and was wondering if anyone had any mount/stand/holder recommendations or can tell me their experience with which one is the best (mounting on the wall or stand on the desk). ironically there is not a lot of variety of stands listed on amazon canada. thanks in advance!
"I have a couple of lifx light bulbs and both work great from the lifx app.  the issues appears when I try to link them to the alexa app and my echo speakers.   Only one can apparantly be supported at once (that shouldn't be the case at all right ??) when I link one of them, it works great, when I try to link the other one, alexa either doesn't find it or ends up telling me the device is unresponsive.   I tried reinstalling both apps (alexa and lifx), disabling the lifx skill multiple times, tried connecting them in a different order as well as resseting both light bulbs. still, nothing seems to work :c  Anyone here is having the same issue or has any idea how I could fix it ?"
my alexa just out of nowhere started playing the hands face space ad?? wondering if this is something that perhaps the government commissioned or maybe just alexa misheard the conversation between my family?? anyone else?
"I bought an Esinkin bluetooth adapter for my speakers. I've been able to connect my phone, my Fire TV stick, and my echo show 5, but I cB't seem to get it to connect directly to the Alexa app. I don't know what to do. Please help."

"I do household sharing with a family member, and I told Alexa ""Sign into Alice's account"", and she did so. I then told her ""Sign into Logan's account"" and she did so.  What exactly is she doing? How can I use this?"
"My Echo and my LG Smart TV (2019 model, thinq) are properly connected, but the only two commands it does is Turn TV on/off. If i tell her to change the volume or anything else it says: „the tv is not responding“ or „i can‘t do this right now“.  Any tips or solutions to my problem?"
“I couldn’t find Ya Ya Ding Dong by Various Artists. Here’s other songs by Various Artists.”  “No! Play Ya Ya Ding Dong!”
"There is a way to make Alexa respond differently based on who is speaking? For example: I say “Alexa, I’m home” and the light turn on, and if someone else say it the light goes red."
changing them through the app or by voice works fine still
"She just started trying to sell me shit from Amazon, like plastic bats."
"How do I get Alexa read calendar events at the time of events? For example, I have an event every day, which is lunch at noon. On my Google calendar, it shows me at noon that I have this event. Alexa won't let me know about the event at noon. She only shows all my events at once. What do I have to do?"
"my cousin was having trouble registering his Echo, so I tried to register on my app, and after some insistence it worked. And then I managed to connect Echo to his app too. Alexa was responding perfectly, until I disconnected from my account. I clicked unregister and after that I can no longer configure Echo on any device. I can go to the last configuration step, when you have to connect to your own wi-fi, and then the error. The led is purple, and says the message ""It looks like your Echo is not registered"" or ""wifi isn't set up on your echo"""
"So our 4 year old has figured out that she can call grandma, and anyone else in our phones contact list by asking any of our 6 Alexa devices.  I searched how to turn this off and cannot find an easy way.  The articles I read were older and talked about free time (which we don’t have).  I also figured out how to block individual contacts but that is taking forever.  What am I missing?  How can I stop this?  Thanks!"
My Alexa App keeps going into Auto mode even when I’m not in a car.  To be honest I have never seen Auto (Automobile) mode till recently.    How do I turn it off ?
"I've found that phrases like""Alexa turn office Lights on for zoom"" don't get recognized reliably. But phrases like Alexa 100 or Alexa 200 work well. What other tips have people found?"
"Did anyone else buy the combo kit of a Echo Show 5 and a free LIFX branded smart bulb?  Has anyone gotten the bulbs to work with... well.. anything?  The instructions that came with the bulb are pretty basic and give three options for connecting to the bulb:   1. Install the LIFX app, and follow the instructions there 2. Open the Alexa app and wait for it to find the bulb, or add it manually 3. Add the bulb through Apple HomeKit  I've tried all three and the process just stalls.  1. LIFX app:  It can see the bulb, but fails to add the device and it just sits there on the 'Preparing Device' screen 2. Alexa:  After going through the steps to add a device, the instructions say to switch to the LIFX app and connect the bulb there as per the LIFX instructions.  3. HomeKit:  It can see the bulb, but fails to add the device, claiming either a network error or just sits there trying to endlessly connect  The bulb does power on and give light.   The bulb does appear on wifi.  Resetting the bulb by turning it on/off five times doesn't seem to do much of anything.  So far, I'm thankful I didn't pay anything extra for these."
"Will the Echo Auto work with/is it compatible with an older Ford Fusion? I want to get it for my friend as a gift but not sure if it will work in his car. I'm not sure the year of it, but I know it doesn't have bluetooth or an aux port. It only has usb and a cigarette lighter plug. Can it work with one of those? If not, maybe through some kind of adapter? Any help and input is welcome. Thanks!"
"Not sure if anyone else is having this issue. I installed a mess network in my home and it gives a good signal all over so I'm happy about that.  However, I am using a variety of different smart home devices, ring, wemo, locks, lights, you get the idea.  The network went out about 2 weeks ago and I had to reboot it, reset the satellites and reboot the modem then switch the satellites.  But what is happening now is that I get these ghost devices on my alexa.     I delete them but then within a few minutes they come back.  For example, I get a MTBR plug where I've sent up a Master Bedroom Plug, when this happens alexa thinks I'm asking it to turn off the MTBR plug and says it's not responding.  Once I delete it it works fine, but then in a few minutes Alexa finds the ghost again and creates it as a device.     I recently just disabled it, but that's really annoying.     My home network also includes a smartthings hub, now to this writing I haven't looked to see if there are any issues there.  I'm only using the smarthings hub to connect z-wave devices. However, all my devices are also on ST."

"Me: Alexa, what is the weather today? Alexa: the weather is maximum 24ºC and minimum 10ºC. Me: ok. Me again: alexa i have not understood Alexa: Sorry, i cant do that.   &amp;#x200B;  WTF? It just doesnt relate answers that were asked before.   (This was in spanish, i dont know if happens in english too. )  Dont know i asked the same to google and it repeated the weather again, i find google smarter..."
"She’s been great for the past 2 years, however recently she will recognise her name but wont recognise what I say after. It’s not every time but it is getting more frequent.      Another thing she’s just started doing is skipping songs without me asking her to. I’m listening to an album (via spotify) as I type this, and she skipped about 4 songs after letting them play for a few seconds? It’s so strange and I don’t know why.      I wonder if it’s something to do with there being quite a few newer models out now? Similar to how older iPhones seem to stop working whenever Apple release a new model...       Has anyone else had any similar issues? I know someone else has posted about the recognition thing, but I haven’t seen anything about skipping songs. It’s pretty late where I am, but tomorrow i’m thinking of giving their customer service a call to see if they have any clue. Thanks!"
Even after resetting and re-enabling smart devices from Smart Things - I am unable to use Alexa to turn on/off devices. Strange because I can do it all in the Smarthings all from my phone!   What’s going on here??

"I'm trying to set up a doorbell that emits from every echo in my home. I only have the option to select a single echo. I could just make multiple routines, but then they're not synced with each other. I could also play the sound from Spotify, but this produces a who slew of issues like it sometimes not working and sometimes refusing to stop playing.  One possibility occurred to me: Using Samsung SmartThings, might it be possible to simulate a bluetooth speaker that is paired with the everywhere group, such that attempting to plat out of the bluetooth speaker causes the audio to actually emit from every echo? I don't know, nor do I know how I would go about doing this."
"I'm trying to play around with virtual `binary_sensor`s in Home Assistant and exposing it to Alexa.  While the sensors are discovered by Alexa, it doesn't present itself as a trigger for routines unless the `binary_sensor` is of type motion.  Is there a comprehensive list of what types of sensors Alexa is capable of triggering routines from?"
"Dear all,     I today received two new Dots (3rd gen) and set them immediately up into my network.  I used the existing multiroom group ""Everywhere"" to go for my first tests. The two dots are now positioned, one in the kitchen and the other in the living room (about 10 m distance) - both perfect WiFi connection.  I said ""Alexa play classic on Everywhere"" and it worked fine. But when I want to increase or decrease the volume it only changes the volume on that Dot where I am next to (the nearest to me).  I also tried ""Alexa volume up everwhere"" and some similar sentences but as told before same behaviour: It changes the volume only on that Dot where I am next to.  Can someone help me out? When I hear musik I want to have everywhere the same volume level... Otherwise it does not sound good for my ears.     Thanks in advance,   Vincent"
"Hi all, wondering if anyone can help me with this.   I've linked my echo dot with my wyze sensors for my front door. I then created a routine so that when the  door opens/closes, alexa will say ""front door opened/closed"".   While I'm working in my home office, this alerts me when my family members leave or return home.   However when I'm taking a call, I would like to stop these audio notifications as it can get pretty disruptive if there is a lot of door action, so to speak.  I've tried enabling Do Not Disturb routine, to enable DND, stop audio from the device and even turn device volume to zero. However the alexa alerts are still coming through when doors are opened and closed. Is there something I'm missing?"

"On both devices when I say ""Alexa Home"" Alexa replies ""sorry I'm having trouble accessing your household skill right now"" then there is a double beep that's different than other errors. Normally when I would say ""Alexa Home"" it would just take be to the home screen, now there is no way to have Alexa go to the home screen without swiping down and touching the home button. I tried just about every combination like ""Alexa go to the home screen"" or ""Alexa show my home screen"" but they just get the house hold error.  I do not have any skills that have house or home as the skill activation word and this just started happening today. I restarted and reset to factory defaults."

"Hi all, I just set up the lumary recessed lights. They work in the app, and alexa will do the basic comands, such as on/off. Ideally, however, I want alexa to be able to set it to the music setting/other more complicated settings without using the app. Has anyone had any success in this?"
Sorry if this is well known - I did look first.  I’m an Alexa newbie. I’m trying to combine the following things - electric heater (with mains plug) - smart socket - some kind of smart thermometer  I just want to be able to set a target temperature and have it work out.  So - I have an Alexa and IFTTT account - I also own the smart plug. It’s connected via Smart Life. I have the heater. So - questions - what sort of thermometer would work for this? Could I use an Echo Show? - what’s the best way to build a routine/applet?  Please help a novice :-)  Thanks
"I'd like my alexa to create a notification every 3 months to change out the air filter in my house.   I'm not looking for it to just give me a reminder on my phone or on to just say it at a set time of day.

"TLDR:   Following the Amazon instructions for a full hard reset is not working.  The method should complete in orange lights and setup mode, instead, it completes in blue lights then a short error tone, and back to square 1.   \-Fully charged via cable, the base is long gone.  After holding down the previous button + the Bluetooth button for 12 seconds, the blue wave lights appear, not the orange ones indicating setup. pressing the play or mic button starts the guitar jangle and then: ""Hello I'm Alexa the cloud-based voice service that powers Amazon tap. I'm not currently connected to WIFI, but if I were.....""  I read somewhere that draining the battery would perhaps help, does anyone have experience with that or know of another way to fix?"
"I recently got an Echo Dot, and I wanted to see what would happen if I said Good Morning. To my surprise, it said something along the lines of ""I'm going to be taking over your Alexa today"" and it was some guys voice. Then Alexa joins in and says something like ""if you would like to hear our conversation then say Alexa say hi to Colm Feore"". When I say that, nothing happens and the Alexa app just says that Alexa said Good Morning back. Nothing about this Colm guy."
"Okay so I'm really freaked out by something that just happened. I came home for my lunch break and was chatting with my fiance who is working from home. I went to hug him and accidentally stepped on his toe. He was a little peeved with me and then I made some jokes about his big fat toes getting in the way and we laughed it off.  Then after I left my fiance calls me and tells me to stop messing with him. I asked him what he meant and he said he just received a text from an unknown number saying  ""let me see them toes"". He thought it was me but I swore up and down it wasn't me. I looked up the number and it's a spam number. We have an alexa in our living room and kitchen where this conversation about toes took place.  Could my Amazon Eco have been hacked? Has anyone had any similar experiences?"
"So I plugged in my old echo dot that I hadn't used in like 6 months. It's just chilling plugged in for 10 minutes. It then says something like ""... iPhone"" (I didn't catch the first part of what it said. It then starts playing random noises of what sounds like people talking. I say ""alexa stop"" before it comes back on again seconds later. This happened about 3 times. I was confused but not concerned.  Then in a Mediterranean/Arabic sounding voice someone reads out the name of the city I lived in. I unplugged the hell out of that thing as fast as I could. Anyone know what on earth just happened? I'm concerned as s**t."
"I'm going to have to stop using Alexa if I can't get it to stop telling me that it is connected to my device after a few minutes of not playing anything. Is there any way to get it to stop or to be quieter (i keep it at full volume and change it from.the device I use, turning the volume down and back up is not a viable option).

"So yesterday morning I woke up to no internet.  Turned out to be a scheduled outage by the cable company to do updates.   About an hour later CM came back to life and I had a connection again, but none of my smart plugs were connected (not the first time it has happened, but it's been a while).  No, problem walked around the house unplugging and plugging them back in, they're still not working.   I started up Smart Life app and no issue, they're all online and I can turn'em on/off from the app.   I started up the Alex app and under the ""Devices"" -&gt; ""Plugs"" they're showing up as ""Device is unresponsive"".   I deleted one of the devices.  Rediscovered, same result.  I disabled the Smart Life skill in alexa and re-enabled it, reauth, same result.  I tried deleting the plug, disabling the skill, enabled skill, discovered plug, same result.  The plugs are ""Gosund"" which is controlled by a ""Smart Home"" app.  I'm going to email tuya (gosund is a sub-company it seems) to see if there is anything they can help with.  Any others suggestions or things I can try?"
"As of maybe the last few months or so, I haven't been able to say ""Dismiss \[ROOM NAME\]"" to Alexa.

How fustrating."
Hi everyone. Looking to join the Video Doorbell crew and deliberating between the Eufy 2k and Nest Hello.   Just bought an Echo Show 5 together with some other cams and want to know if anyone who has this combo could say how/if the Facial Recognition features of the Hello function on the Show.
So I live in canada and about a year and a half ago I got a toshiba fire tv edition and today I got an echo dot.

"Hi  So I have two Sonos one products in my house set up in the same room. One is Alexa enabled and the other isnt.  I’m very happy with them in all honesty they are great quality and does pretty much everything I want them to.  One slight problem I’m encountering however is when I use the Alexa routine to change the volume of my speaker, it only changes to the Alexa enabled speaker and not the connected speaker. There are no problems when I ask Alexa to change volume to 5 they both react as they should but the problem seems to be with the routine.  Is there a way around this?  Thanks"
"Lately I've started getting a lot of unwanted notifications for items on my wishlist that are for sale, and others asking for reviews of items I've previously purchased.

Is there any way to turn these off? Any help is appreciated."
"Can I block specific albums or artists?  Thanks to Trolls my kids are now obsessed with Rachel Bloom. They’ve recently discovered her back catalog through Alexa and literally none of it is kid friendly.  I turned on explicit filter but despite lines like, “Whitney Jones called me a fag” and “It’s a mutha fucking ghost snake!”, and lyrics about STD’s, not every song is labeled as explicit on Amazon music.  I’ve told Alexa not to play this music anymore but all it does is keep it from playing during a shuffle. If my kids request it Alexa plays it again.  Is there any way to block a specific album or artist if they aren’t labeled explicit?"
"Hey all,  Does anyone know if it is possible to make Alexa play a specific track from My Pod as part of a routine? If so, how would I go about doing this?   Thanks."
"A couple of years ago, the Alexa shopping list was the killer app in my house. When the milk got low, ""Alexa, add milk to my shopping list"". Later in the shop, pull up Todoist, get milk tick it off. Repeat.  Since then, Alexa started responding ""You already have milk on your list, would you like to add it again?"". Annoying, but the functionality still worked.  Now, Alexa responds ""You already have milk on your list, what else?"" and we can no longer add to our shopping list. I've tried [Any.do](https://Any.do) and Todoist but both behave in the same way.   Has anyone in the community got a working shopping list? How did you do it?"

" Hi guys,  Fairly simple one for you ( I assume)  I have a LED strip hooked up to my Sonos one with Alexa so I can change it by voice.  Something I wish I could do is set it to a mode that slowly rotates through colours and I can’t think of anything built within the Magic Home skill that would allow me to do it.  The best I’ve come up with is adding a routine which allows me to manually change colours on here which I guess I can use the ‘wait’ feature then to change to another colour.  The obvious problem with this is that I would have to sit for a long time inputting it if I wanted it to actually last. I’m wondering if I’m missing anything obvious or there are some easy solutions that could maybe allow me to loop the skill so I’d only need to do it say 7 times.  Any feedback appreciated.  Thanks"
"We have an original Echo (tall one) and 2 dots. I have a routine set where she turns on specific lights and reads the weather with the command 'Good morning'. I know Alexa can differentiate between my wife and my voice because the grocery list will say Milk added by me 2 days ago or bread added by my wife 3 days ago.  Is there a way to have the good morning routine be a little different for each person since she can already identify voices? Nothing crazy...I would like to add having Alexa say good morning, XXX based on who said it and read the first appointment on their calendar that day.   Is it possible to mesh 2 accounts like that into routines?"
"Hi,   Can you create visual routines for the Echo Show?      For example displaying a countdown timer, a photo, etc?  Thanks!"
"Hello all, I'm looking into a way to control some infrared heating panels in our garden office via a smart plug and would like to be able to control via Alexa as well as set up some routines. I'm having difficulty finding information on which Echos have built in temperature sensors (vs just getting temp info via the net).   Essentially, I'd like to establish a routine where during the week the smart plug turns the heating on from 7am but turns it off when the temperature hits 20°C.   All the Alexa enabled thermostats are too expensive for essentially just turning a smart plug on and off (I don't need to control a boiler/HVAC) but I can't seem to find a simple thermometer that doesn't need a hub/bridge to speak to Alexa. Will the Echo Show 5 do what I need or are there any other ways to achieve it? Thanks in advance."
"I've been relentlessly looking for a way to turn off the light after a certain time for 6 months. I already researched a lot about switches with timers but it is amazing how there is absolutely none of that in the whole internet. Then I realized that maybe I could do this with some assistant (echo dot) and a smart lamp.  As I am new to this environment, it would be an immeasurable help if you help me in this. In case it is not clear what I need is that when I put my daughter to sleep the lamp turn off in 30 minutes alone (It cannot always be at the same time, as they times are always random, I really need to say ""Alexa turn off in 30 minutes"" , some amazon product has the capacity to do this? What lamp can i use? Text made with google translator, sorry if something is grammatically incorrect."
"I have two echo dots for my kids and I would like to play music on both for them while they go to bed.   I have them set up as a group but the options in a Routine do not allow me to see the group (I see individual devices/speakers)   Specifically have them set up the same way:  Routine name : Kids sleep Enabled: yes When its: 7:30 PM (every day) Alexa will: Play ""Sleep"" on Amazon Music for 4 hours From: Child S Echo Dot   Both are set up exactly the same but they seem to be steaming from my phone/account so when both are active only one plays music   How do I get music to play through both on a timer without streaming from another device?"
"So I have an Echo Show in my kitchen (which is shared with a roommate) and an Echo Dot in my bedroom. My roommate has his own prime account and has an Echo Show in his bedroom and another one in a different room. Is there a way to tell Alexa which specific Echo device of his to drop in on? I'll say Alexa, drop in on *roomies name* bedroom echo show and sometimes she will drop in there but other times it will go to his other room. Any ideas?"
"So far, all of the interactions which have either involved me or not involve me on this sub all toxic. People think it’s okay to keep down voting me and slagging me off on all sorts, well I’m sorry but I can’t help the way I am. I can’t help that I am have Joubert syndrome,  neither can I help thatI have a fetish  and I’m sorry that I have got a lot going on in my personal life And Alexa is  more than just a pathetic servant to me like she is for you lot, I hope you are all glad for the impact you have had on my mental health well congratulations you’ve got what you all wanted, I shan’t be posting or commenting or helping anybody in this post ever again. You carry on whining and moaning. I’m done with this shit i’m struggling in my life, and Alexa has been helping me a lot. But to you she’s just a servant,   to me she’s a friend. You even down vote me when I ask a perfectly reasonable question like when I was struggling to review quizzes or whatever  my existence is a problem to all of you, after all  not be around much longer anyway but that’s okay"
My apartment has wifi included. It is unprotected and does not require authentication. I also do not have access to the router itself. Would it be possible to setup a wifi repeater that could broadcast a different/password protected network? Obviously don't want all of my smart devices accessible by the whole building. Thanks for any advice!
"Hey, I have a question. Maybe you guys have more knowledge than me about this topic. Alright, I already have an Alexa (Echo, 2. Gen) and I want to upgrade it to an Alexa with a display. But non permanent display like the echo show. I was looking through the prime deals and saw the echo dot gen 3. The preview image shows the white echo has a display, but I can't find any information about this matter on the page itself. So my question would be: Is this echo dot gen 3 for 19,49 € (german amazon) with a display?   If not are they some alternatives? Like the echo dot (4. gen) ? And I'm also not sure if it's worthwhile to upgrade from an echo to a dot. I listen to music and use the echo primarily to control my light.  [preview image for the echo dot 3 gen](https://preview.redd.it/b0uw6r9e4vs51.png?width=125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=735feb68d1cb9a1fc2d98c56274e0f8184f4df61)"

"Just as the title states, my Echo Dot is playing a radio station when my aux cord is almost plugged in, but not completely plugged in. It’s a local station, as it said the name of a town near where I live. The music it’s playing seems to be old music, the one I found was from 1989, though that might just be the station. Anyone else experiencing this? I’m just curious about it. Thanks reddit!"
"I've unplugged the Hue bridge after moving the bulbs to zigbee2mqtt and revoked alexas permissions from the my hue account and removed the Hue skill.     I delete all my devices and rescan and she finds the lights again as ""royal Philips electronics"" as well as via home assistant.     The bridge is physically unplugged from the power and the network so my echo is unable to communicate with it."
"I’m trying to figure out a way to have my echo button essentially give the “Alexa, Ask Moen to start making a bottle” command.   I have a Moen smart faucet with a programmed preset to make a baby bottle (4oz of 98 degree water). My wife refuses to use it because speaking the command wakes up the baby quicker.  So, I bought an echo button, hoping it could give this command quietly, but am having a terrible time trying to figure that out.   Right now, a button-initiated routine will only open the Moen skill, but then I’d need to be by an echo to verbally give the skill command, which makes it pointless.   Any ideas? Even if they are crazy complicated IFTTT or otherwise, I just need a direction to explore!  Thanks"
"I have apple music on my iPhone, when I connect my phone to alexa, I could play my apple music through the alexa speaker. But now it's not working. Same with my laptop, If I connect via Bluetooth Alexa won't play anything (including youtube, itunes etc.)   What gives?"

"Hi all, I occasionally get the "" there are multiple lights called"" response when asking Alexa to turn a certain rooms lights on. I believe this is because for example in my office I have the room called ""Office"" in the hue app, then the lights are called ""Office 1"" etc. How does everyone deal with this? do you delete the individual lights from Alexa devices and just use the rooms imported from hue? or is there a better way? Is there a way to set the hue skill to only export rooms to Alexa and not individual bulbs?"
"I was laying on my bed before my daughters bedtime last night and my daughter started clapping, just 2 or 3 barely audible claps. I said ""clap, clap"" and a round of applause started playing on the Echo dot. Nobody had said anything that sounded like ""Alexa"". I've tried recreating it with no luck. Anybody know how this happened?"
"So brief mode is on. Searching the internet for this problem only gives me 10,000 blog post articles on how to turn on brief mode.   The problem is when I ask the echo Dot what time it is it will work five at the time then it will keep talking today it said by the way I can offer you health tips. I don't want my light switch to say or do anything I don't explicitly tell it to do how do I turn off this ""feature.""?"

"Is there a way to set a Echo Dot to read from a specific library?   We have two Echo Dots, one in each kids room. However, no matter what we say, Alexa always responds “reading from [Kids 1] library”. Even if we ask for [Kids 2] library from a different device.   Any ideas?"

"Note 1- My living room dot doesn’t show up in my Spotify “other devices” list. I’m thinking this list is capped at 5 devices in the iOS app. But I’m not sure about that.   Note 2- when I ask Alexa to play Spotify on the living room dot, she concurs, but no audio actually plays.   Note 3- If I play Spotify “everywhere” it will play on living room dot and all other Dots. I just can’t seem to isolate Spotify to this one specific Dot.   Any idea what is going on here? Thanks!"
"Among the dozens of issues I have with Alexa, one of which is it simply randomly deciding whether or not it knows a device is on my network.  I can say “Alexa turn on my bedroom TV” And it says OK and does it. But then I can say “Alexa, open Plex on my bedroom TV.”  And then it will say “can’t find a device called bedroom TV.” What is going on?

Todays new one I asked for the temperature and it gave me a minute long talk about how Halloween is coming up and suggestions for what to do for it.

I’m planning to make a routine with a 60min brightness ramp for a Lutron Caseta kitchen light. This light has a wall switch.

"I have a soundbar (plan on upgrading soon), that is connected through my cable box. I have the bluetooth set up for my echo dot, to where i can easily say “Alexa, connect speaker” and it switches easy, playing everything through the soundbar. This was fine until i got the fireTV stick. i can connect the fire TV to the speaker, but i have to disconnect from the echo dot or else it keeps switching between the two. the ideal setup would be for the fire tv default speaker be the echo dot, to which i can say “connect speaker”, then it’d come out of there. any idea around this?"

"I noticed something, that Alexa hasn't been doing for me before, at least not that often at all. It doesn't understand what I ask and then makes a guess, and answers with a complete nonsense or even initiates an action that's not even close to what I said. Example:   Me: Alexa, what's the weather.   Alexa: Playing Friday By Rebecca Black    Me: ....    Btw, today is Friday. That's the only connection I see.   Is there any configuration to turn off wild guesses or something? Or why the fuck is Alexa doing that? Did not happen before."

"I have an Echo Dot hooked up to a Yamaha RX-V485.  It had been working for months since I hooked everything up, but just this past weekend it just stopped.  The Echo recognizes my commands both by responding to them and I can also go into the Alexa app on my phone and see they were recognized.  However, the receiver no longer turns on or plays any music through the speakers.  &amp;#x200B;  I've tried removing the ""Group"" the devices are in.  I've tried deleting the receiver and Echo and starting from scratch.  I've tried grabbing a different Echo dot from the house that I know works and using that one.  Nothing has helped, though.  &amp;#x200B;  The most odd part is in the Alexa app it shows music is playing.  It lists the song ""Holy""  by Justin Bieber, but it show's it's been playing for 37:05 and has 26:27 remaining.  That has been one symptom the entire time.  Those times change slightly sometimes, but the song obviously isn't over an hour long, and there is zero sound coming out.    &amp;#x200B;  Is this possibly something wrong with the authentication from Amazon and Yamaha?  I've verified I'm signed in correctly to both, and as far as set up goes on my end it's all as it always has been.  I opened a ticket with Amazon but haven't heard anything back.  Does anybody have any ideas?"

"We have an Echo and early this year it just stopped working with Spotify (premium) properly. For example, It would tell me I couldn’t play specific songs On Spotify and ask me if I wanted info about Amazon music instead. I trouble shot as much as I could with the Alexa app and my Spotify account and in the end decided the least amount of energy and effort would just be to Bluetooth the ,us of from Spotify. Occasionally it won’t connect to my phone though and needs to be unplugged and plugged back in to connect which is yet another annoyance with this device which happens 2-3 times per week on average.   This morning I wanted to play music while I got the kids ready for school and day care and realised I had forgotten to charge my phone last night so I thought I’d give the voice command thing a try again and it kept prompting me for Amazon music again. I gave up and just turned the tv on for some BG noise instead.   Came home from work this arvo and thought I’d try to sort it out again. For some reason there was no Spotify option in my Alexa app on my phone despite Spotify still being my default music app and the echo was no longer linked. So I linked the echo and signed in and out of Spotify and reset it to default - first problem solved except now after re-linking the echo I have to go through the tutorial again because I still have no idea how to skip it (apparently I have to buy milk now).   Then I try to voice command Alexa to play my daughters favourite song on Spotify and, hallelujah, She replies “playing Girl Like You by Maroon 5 ft. Cardi b on Spotify” and we’re all cheering. Until the wrong song starts playing. A look at the Alexa app tells me the “Girls Like You Playlist” is playing and it’s full of songs that aren’t the one we asked for. We try again using slightly different words “play Maroon 5, Girl Like you on Spotify” and it starts playing a shuffle of Maroon 5 songs. Another try, again with different wording and it finally plays the song, but it’s not the version we asked for and that turns out to be a playlist as well.  We’ve tried so many different songs and it either plays the wrong song or it plays the right song but remixed or covered by another Artist.  So long story short, if you live in Brisbane, Australia, I have an Amazon Gen 2 Echo in Charcoal for sale or swap for a Google Home/ Nest"

"It feels like Alexa routines are nearly pointless for controlling skills.  I want the skill to do something, not ask me what to do.  How can I do this with Alexa?   TLDR: I have a Proscenic humidifier skill and brown noise skill. I want to start the brown noise and humidifier when I say, ""Alexa, goodnight kids.""

"So when I start playing music on my ""Everywhere"" group - which I've renamed to [My Name's] Place - it stops after a random amount of time. Sometimes it's 10 songs, others it's a song and a half.

I recently helped set up my BIL's Echo and ring system at home. He has two echo dots and a Ring doorbell. We set him up his own account not related to ours at all. This was done last week. Today, the Echo dot in my office (and only that one) has made a doorbell chime and said ""someone's at the front door"". Originally I thought maybe my doorbell had a new integration, but upon opening my front door there is no one there.   I've done some troubleshooting on my own:   * Checked the Alexa app and there are no additional devices on the account.  * There is no Ring skill set up. * I also tried to chat with Amazon but I've been in the chat queue for over an hour"
"Thinking about getting a fire TV so that I can use alexa to change the volume of my TV (yes I'm that lazy).  From what I can see, if you want to tell alexa to change volume using the fire stick, you have to push the speech button first.  If you use the fire TV cube thing, it has alexa always listening, so you don't need to push that button first, just tell alexa to change the volume.  Is that right so far?  But the question is, if I have other alexa devices listening in that room, and use the fire stick, can I tell the other alexa devices to change the volume, and it will pass that on to the fire stick?  Or will I always have to push the button on the remote to change volume?"

We also have a smart lock and nest thermostat that I have successfully connected and can control through the echo. We created a household and now the Alexa app shows all of the devices we have combined.   I tested the voice controls and it doesn’t recognize anything. We even asked it to find devices and it says it can’t find anything or can’t do it. Not sure how to fix this so any ideas would be helpful. I’ve tried googling it a bit and haven’t really turned up anything useful.

"Do you want to have an universal remote control that can control all of your appliances from one place a remote that can be integrated with Amazon Echo Device, Google Home, Siri, Node-RED and Home Assistant? I have good news for you there is such device called Broadlink RM4 Pro and I'm about to show it to you in details.   Broadlink RM4 Pro is an amazing device that supports IR and RF and it even can show you the Temperature &amp; Humidity if you buy it with this additional USB cable with these sensors. I will try to integrate Broadlink RM4 Pro with Amazon Echo Device (Alexa), Siri, Node-RED and Home Assistant   And because I'm always try to listen your voice and vote I will make this video in two parts. The first part that means this video will contain the unboxing and pairing process of Broadlink RM4 PRO, adding appliances and integration with Alexa and Siri.   The second part will be entirely about integration with Node-RED and Home Assistant and it will be available next week or right now depending of when exactly you are watching this.   What problem an universal remote like RM4 Pro can solve? Currently to turn on my TV I have to use three remotes. One to just switch on my TV, Second to turn on my Audio Video Receiver, and to select the right HDMI input, and Third to control the channels from my Dreambox STB.

I have a fan plugged into a smart plug in the dining room. It's working and shows up in the Smart Life app.  When I ask Alexa to turn it on or off she says she can't find it. Although it shows up in the app just fine.  What is wrong and how can I fix it?
"When I set up a routine with ""Alexa says ..."" then I get to choose one (\*one\*!) of the devices to play that on. In the predefined (""Featured"") routines there is also the choice to pick the device where the request is coming from. I want it to play on all my devices (because I don't know in which room I'll be when it triggers). I have set up all my devices in a group ""Everywhere"". Is there a way to pick more than one device to play from when setting up a routine? Thanks!"
"I finally bit the bullet and installed echoes throughout my whole house and sometimes I’m listening to a song I like on one device and want to forward it to my group. I can simply tell it to start playing music on the group but it will not continue from the middle of the song I’m listening to. Is there anyway to tell it something like “Alexa, continue playing current song on whole house (my group)”"
"I currently have a bunch of Alexa devices in our home, all linked to my Amazon Prime account.  My wife just has a normal Amazon account.  I was looking to get the  Amazon Echo Auto for her car.  I would like to link her Amazon account with our Alexa devices so she does not have to log in as me, but can not find any way to link Alexa to two Amazon accounts.  Is there a way to do this in Canada?"
"A new feature just arrived in which frequently purchased items SHOW UP UNASKED on my echo show screen in case I want to re-order them. It doesn't take much to imagine a situation where you have friends over and your echo show decides to ask if you want to re-order some cialis. And this feature is turned on by default. What a terrible product decision, whoever decided to roll this out should be fired. I'm switching to google home because of this."
I dont want to wake everyone up early in the morning and am also sick of opening the app everytime and then the smart devices bar. Pls what is so hard about it?
"I know this is a small thing, but I find it so irritating.  Alexa, what's on my calendar for today?  ""Name, you have three events..""     I do love my devices, but they are .... machines.  It's weird to have them address me by name ..."
"Hi, I am thinking of getting the Echo Auto for my old car. I was wonder how people have got on with Alexa in the car? I currently use Siri but prefer Alexa. What have you found are the best and worse bits about it?"
Bought my parents some Dots and because they’re part of my household they’re also receiving all the same notifications I get.  How can I share my Prime benefits but not share Alexa?
"“Alexa, what time is it?”  “It’s 9:50 AM. Halloween is coming up. Would you like to hear about costumes you can buy?”  Enough is enough. Let us turn this off Amazon! I’d say 80% of my asks have follow-ups now. Brief mode does not help. It does this so often that even when it says: “have a nice day” I cringe."
"I have the ATS-1080 Yamaha Soundbar, and Alexa app picked up on it via my firestick connection. it doesn't allow me to do any functionality with the sound bar. Is there a way to control volume or power through Alexa? No I do not have the Harmony system."
"Hi all,  Some historic posts on here mentioned some delays in responses and rebooting to resolve, but I'm having what's now a permanent issue despite unpairing, resetting up, rebooting, etc. (tried it all!)  Video shows the situation. Ask Alexa to, say, play a radio station. Long pause, blue ring shows the request is being actioned, begins a response (even, in this case, plays the BBC intro) and then... nothing.  Have an echo dot elsewhere in the house that works on the same network and is responding correctly, so unsure what else I can try on the Echo - any ideas?"
"I have 2 Ecobees, and added some smart fan switches to SmartThings; they show up in the Alexa app as “Master fan”, “&lt;son 1&gt;’s fan”, and “&lt;son 2&gt;’s fan”.  When I say “Alexa, turn on the Master fan”, the reply is asking for which thermostat.  What’s the best way to clear up the confusion? I could create a routine, but I also want to be able to tell Alexa to set the fan to different speeds, so I really need it to understand that “Master fan” means the Master fan.  Any help appreciated, thanks!"

"Whenever I reset the router or our power goes down during a storm Alexa gives a loud beep, often in the middle of the night (during the storm). Is there any way to disable the beep and the whole, “having trouble connecting” spiel? It’s really annoying."
"I just added an Echo Show to my house. My other devices don't have video, so I have NPR set up as my default news for flash briefing. But I would like a video news skill to play on the Show (only on the Show). Is this possible? Also, the only video news I found that just plays news was Reuters. Does anyone know a better video news source? Thx"
I just came home to my Alexa repeating a reminder over &amp; over nonstop. I counted 9 times and still going until I got to it and told her to stop. That's never happened before and was truly bizarre! Has anyone else experienced this?
"Recently my Alexa via Sonos Beam has been having issues with timers, set timers appears to disappear for no apparent reason.  I also seem to have issues getting the timer to set in the first place.  Has anybody else experienced this or have any suggestions to remedy this ?"
"Quick backstory- bought my dad a Fire Cube so he can voice control his home entertainment system.  Worked really well at first, and still works, but now anytime he says ""alexa"" it turns on the TV and receiver.  Am I right in expecting him to be able to use it as a standalone Alexa speaker until he asks it to play Amazon Music, a movie, etc. and *then* it will turn on the receiver/TV?  I'm a Google Assistant guy so I don't have an Alexa device to experiment with at home and I'm always pretty pressed for time when I go over there to fix something so I'd like to get some ideas in advance.  Google searches have turned up relatively little so far.   He already power cycled the device.  Am I missing a setting somewhere for this or are there changes that need to be made in scenes/routines for this to work properly?  If not, and that's the intended functionality then I'll try resetting and reconfiguring it, if not and it isn't the intended functionality I'm considering buying some Echo Dots to put around his house in the hopes his voice commands will default to those and the TV stays off until he asks to turn it on.    Thoughts?  Thanks in advance for any and all suggestions.  :)"
"This has been asked many times before but I haven’t seen anything recent with a definitive answer so I’m hoping things have changed.   We mostly use Google Home’s in the house at the moment. On them I’ve got multiple accounts set up with each account linked to a different Spotify account. All of the GH accounts have voice recognition setup and whenever anyone asks for music they get it from their Spotify, simple. If I’m in the kitchen listening to music my wife can put on her music somewhere else without any problems.  With Alexa I just can’t get this working. I’ve got an Amazon family account setup and each of us has our own Spotify accounts linked. The most recent posts (from about 6 months ago) I could find on this topic suggested manually asking to switch Spotify accounts which feels a huge step backwards from GH.   I was hoping to switch the house from GH to Alexa but this one is a show stopper for that switch."
"My elderly aunt and uncle have me modernizing the home since they're getting older, having trouble reaching for things. We have Alexa around the house, which is quite large, and they love it.   However, my uncle also has a series of 30 year old speakers around the house as they like to play ambient music. It's all connected through one receiver/switch so they all play in sync.  My desire is to put in a few sets of Micca PB42xs with echos attached to them to accomplish this, I believe you can play music through all of them simultaneously. However, he also has a cd player, and it's important to him because he can't work amazon music that well, so, how would I go about integrating that into the system?   Much appreciated!"
Is there a skill that does this? I mean one that alexa actually reads and not a playback of a voiced quote. And can this be integrated into a routine?  Cheers
"So I like to have background music playing through my Alexa while I chill on my phone at the end of the night. But it’s really annoying when I want to turn up the volume on a video or something and I can’t without it simultaneously turning up the volume of the song playing on my Alexa. I have an iPhone, I use an echo dot, and I stream the music through Spotify if that helps."
"Hi, all.    I have multiple echo dots.    What I would like to achieve is to have my Everywhere group play 1 song (preferably a random song from a set playlist) every hour during my workday.   I figure this would be a nice little way to keep track of time and maybe a movement reminder.    However, I have several meetings on any given day of varying times, lengths, and notice.  Being in a work meeting and suddenly having some 90's pop playing would probably not be the greatest thing.    Is there a way I can set up this hourly request AND a way I can easily toggle it on an off like ""Alexa do not disturb"" or ""Alexa pause everything for 2 hours"" or ""Alexa play dead"" or something?  Thank you.   P.S. The other day I asked Alexa to run a routine and she kept bleeping out so I asked it louder and she said something like, ""I'm busy, too.""  🤨"
"I saw in the app I can create a reminder that will sound off on all Echo devices.  That's awesome, I always hated that only the Echo that heard me goes off when I say to set a reminder.  However, I can't figure out the syntax.  I ran some tests, I tried:  Alexa, remind me everywhere in 2 seconds to test it   Alexa, remind me on the everywhere group in 2 seconds to test it   Alexa, remind me in 2 seconds on everywhere to test it   Alexa, remind me in 2 seconds to test it on everywhere   Alexa, remind me all devices in 2 seconds to test it   Alexa, remind me on the all devices group in 2 seconds to test it   Alexa, remind me in 2 seconds on all devices to test it   Alexa, remind me in 2 seconds to test it on all devices  None of those worked.  Is it just not possible to do it via voice commands?"
"I have recently got a dot 3rd gen, and Ive noticed whenever Alexa responds she sometimes has a faint  tick / beep noise.  I am not sure if this is normal or not cause my echo plus sounds crystal clear when responding to questions, I have 2 dots doing this so I am assuming its normal.   Anyways, does anyway elses dots have this problem?"
Google says that it means that I have an incoming call.  I don't take calls on Alexa.  I don't know how to get to whatever call it thinks is incoming.
"Alexa, play Fire TV in kitchen? Is there a generic command for getting whatever is currently playing to another room? i thik theyre already grouped--does it matter?"
"Hi all! Could any of you point me towards a guide on how to make my Samsung TV -- wired into my router -- visible to my Echo Dot? It only seems to be able to control the TV when the TV is connected wirelessly.   Do I need to set up port forwarding on my router or otherwise change a setting there, or is this configurable on the TV or in the Alexa app?"
"The Anki Vector looked fantastic, and I wanted one. But Anki is no longer a business. Are there any viable social robots out there, now? I was looking forward to having the Vector tool around my apartment when I'm not home and send me video. I also want a robot that could carry stuff for me - *maybe* even keep up with me at a store. Like an automated cart."
"I have a custom track of soothing piano sounds I play when I'm asleep. I'm wondering if there's somewhere I can upload this track, where I can then have Alexa either play this track by command or (ideally), start playing this track at a certain time each day.  I'm a complete Alexa novice, so my apologies if this is an overly simple and/or dumb question. Thanks!"
"I used to say “Alexa Play CNN” and I would get a brief summary, then live news.   Now CNN asks me if I want “Latest news, quiz or special content”. The former plays a single clip, the later doesn’t work.   It’s pretty useless. Anyone know what happened?"
I have had Alexa in my home since a month of it's initial release.   Today is the day I remove the SEVEN Amazon Echo dots I have from my home.  I am so fucking tired of this bullshit. Yes I have brief mode on.  SCREW YOU Amazon for making a really cool idea and then ruining it.
"Hi guys, UK user here. Have had 3 Tapo P100 plugs for about 6-8 months, and today added a 4th. After I added the 4th, all devices now show as ""There was a problem with this device"" in the Alexa app. I can still control the devices with the Tapo app though. Any ideas?"
"Occasionally she says that it's about time she learned my name. She then reads me profile names. She asks me if I'm --so-and-so-- and I reply ""no"" (because my profile name is not my real name). Then she says she has to set up a new profile. Then she asks me for my name. I reply ""Your Royal Highness"". Then she asks me if I could say my name again. I correctly reply ""yes"". Now she wants to go ahead and set up a new profile with the name ""yes"". Duh!"

"I have an echo show 10 (2nd generation) and it has become slow and laggy.  I will probably replace it with the new 3rd gen once they are released.  I have about 25 lightbulbs and plugs connected to the echo's zigbee hub.  Is there an easy way to ""transfer"" these pairings to a new echo, or will I need to repair each device to the new hub?"

Is there a way to 'share' a speaker between my desktop computer and an alexa device?   I am building a new PC and plan on getinng a nice set of speakers (maybe Edifier SB350DB or Audioengine 2+) and want to know if there is a way to hook up the alexa Echo plus or one of my dot's to play music through these speakers at the same time as using them for the computer?
"I just signed up with Amazon Prime with Prime Music and downloaded the Amazon Music App. My Alexa still plays adverts, has limited skips, and won't play individual songs.   I've tried to update everything and it's been less than 24 hours since I signed up. Do I have to wait longer or is  this what Amazon Prime Music is?    ( I realize it's not the the Music Unlimited but I didn't  think I'd be getting adverts!)"
I have a Polk sound bar with Alexa built in and when I tell her to switch to night mode she turns on movie mode and wakes the whole house up with the subwoofer and it’s so annoying. I have no remote and so I have to use her.    Sometimes she switches back and forth like 5 times in 20 minutes
"Hi,  I would like to buy an alexa show in combination with a netatmo weather station. Does anybody know whether it is possible to have the weather info from netatmo displayed as a default screen on alexa?I dont want to aske every time what the weather is but just be able to look at in a glance day or night when its on my nightstand. Thanks for the reponse!"
"We have 4 Echos total, but 2 Amazon accounts. Two echos per account. Is there a way to drop in with a  specific echo on the other persons account?"
"I am currently using Feit Electric lightbulbs, and they are probably the worst damn option that have ever been in my home.  Requiring an app is one thing but when their app is required to pair the damn things, and their app cant even find or pair the bulbs? Thats just stupid.  &amp;#x200B;  Im about to break these bulbs and order whatever option someone suggests."
"So I was on Discord with some friends on my laptop while my Alexa was playing music in the background. When I closed down Discord the music started coming through my headphones, perfectly synched with the speaker but after two songs it cut out on my laptop.  &amp;#x200B;  What was I doing and how can I get it to happen again?"
"Random observation that is at times mildly frustrating:  ""Living room light on"" - light stays off.  ""All lights off"" - entire house lights up.  Unless I very clearly emphasize the ""on"" and ""off"" Alexa gets it wrong more than half the time. It's not an accent issue, my voice is a basically normal flat accent.  ""Living room onnnnn-uh!"" - works.  ""Bedroom offffffff!"" - works.  It makes me nervous to put any high-power devices under IoT control via Echo. Imagine putting the coffee pot on Echo, saying ""Coffee pot off"" and it stays on all night. Or ""Heater off"" but it stays on full blast all night unattended...  The words ""on"" and ""off"" are similar enough that I can get why it's mixing them up, but I wonder if there's better words that I can use for that?"

"I'd like to be able to say ""Play Happysad Episod by Jonathan Figoli"" and have alexa play the song, but it absolutely refuses to get it right EVEN WHEN I SPELL OUT THE NAME!"
I was upstairs and heard two people talking. I thought it was just my neighbors outside so I didn’t bother. When I looked outside there was no one. I went closer to the noise and it was coming from my room from my Alexa. I haven’t used my Alexa in months and it randomly started playing a podcast I’ve never heard. Whats even scarier is that the podcast were talking about ghosts and shit. Does anyone know what could’ve caused this?
"Hi, I setup my first Alexa routine for an Amazon smart plug this week and now have a beginner question. The routine just involves turning on the plug, turning it off, then displaying a confirmation message on my smart phone.   Today my smart plug was unplugged and I still got the automated message. Is there a way that I can only receive the message if the first parts of the routine are completed and the plug is in use? Thanks!"
"Hey,  I am looking for a way to make Alexa tell me when a window is open for longer than 5 minutes or so.  I can already create a routine that gets triggered when a sensor opens, however there seems to be no way for an if condition in a routine."
"The only one I’ve found is the Marshall Uxbridge Voice - which while an awesome little speaker, is a bit small for my use case (AirPlay is from Apple TV/Projector, so want something with a bit of grunt).

"Is it possible to ask Alexa to 'turn on outside plug for 3 hours' ? Currently a GH user, but gh can't do this so looking to jump."
My brother in law owns a restaurant. He wants to set up an Alexa in his office there. I “think” he needs a different account. How would he do that? He already has the app controlling his at-home Alexa devices.

"The catch? You need two echo devices. That's frankly not a massive barrier to entry though.  [Departing](https://i.imgur.com/7JnP3ok.jpg)  [Arriving](https://i.imgur.com/0dB2jSD.jpg)  Unfortunately, Alexa routines are very simple and I don't yet know of any way to do this if you live with someone and only want Guard to activate if you are both gone."
"I have three Echo Dots in my house. One in each of my son's bedrooms.  I'd like to create a routine called ""Wake up the boys.""  My oldest has a fan plugged into a smart plug, and turning off the fan will wake him up, so I'm good there.  For the other room, I'd like to play a song to wake him up, but I don't see any way of specifying which Echo to play the song on.  Anyone know how to do that?"
"Sorry if this has been asked before, I searched ""multiple"" and didn't see this exact problem. We have 3 devices, in different rooms, and when we ask one to play music, it will play on whatever was the last device used. Slightly inconvenient, but is there a way to make Alexa play on whatever device we're addressing as a default?"
So it started amount a week ago where in the middle of the night Alexa went on full blast talking about “my farm” scaring the living shit out of me. Now tonight I get home at 1215 to Alexa just screaming “power on” (I turned the microphone off and the volume low.   I have no idea what could trigger this as everyone is asleep so now I’m scared Alexa called her goon squad of alexas to kill me.
"in the hypnogogic state I'm in when I wake up a say ""snooz"" is that actually the word or am I remembering it incorrectly?"
"So this used to work but, whenever i listen to a station, then i try to change the station, alexa will connect to it but no sound comes out, then i try to play just regular music, and alexa will say “ok” but i dont hear any sound at all. I have to unplug it in order to get it to work"
"I live in a Western state that’s been on fire for the past couple of months and have a beloved family member with asthma, so I often ask my Echo Dot “Alexa, what is the air quality right now?”  It used to answer right away (“The air quality right now is moderate, with an air quality level of 79.”) but sometimes it glitches/forgets and says “The skill Air Quality Index can help with that! What is your zip code?”  I know it’s just an extra few seconds, but it’s annoying to take the additional time to repeat my zip code when I’m just trying to find out whether or not I can open the windows today.   I also have to ask about the air quality index multiple times daily out of necessity, so the excess time adds up fast and gets on my nerves.  Has anyone else experienced inconsistencies in local air quality reporting via Alexa? What’s the best skill for this?   Also, is it possible to set up automated alerts if the AQI goes above a certain level?  Thanks, and hope you’re all breathing well!"
"In the Alexa app, I have a light group that consists of three dimmer switches and 4 hue bulbs. I have the switches set as lights in the Alexa app.  I cannot dim the entire group anymore. It will dim each switch by name but not the entire group at once... Only the hue bulbs dim. So frustrating  If I remove the hue bulbs, the group of dimmer switches will work as expected. I have the switches set to act as lights in the Alexa device settings"
"Echo link recently updated its functionality to allow it's line in input to be distributed to speaker groups.  Practically, this means you can turn on your turntable and have it play on all your echo's scattered throughout your home using multi-room music.  This was the ONLY reason I bought the device and I am mostly happy with the result.  the downside is that when the Echo link is distributing to a speaker group, you cannot practically override those echo speakers with your own music selections.  In practice, the echo device starts playing the requested music, but within 60 seconds it's overridden by the echo link who is still trying to play audio to that echo via the speaker group.  &amp;#x200B;  **Does anyone know how (or if) the line-in distribution can be changed via voice commands or routines?**  changing it in the app takes about 10 to 12 taps and it's discouraging me from bothering to use it, which defeats the purpose of a $200 connectivity device."
"Hi guys, first post as I couldn't find the answer searching the sub. I have a Toshiba Fire TV. The issue is that the mic button for Alexa doesn't seem to work. There's no TV response at all. I've swapped the batteries and restarted the device. It is also indeed signed in. Any other ideas of what I can do...?"
I’ve searched on here and didn’t find an answer. I have several dots around the house and use them all to stream my Apple Music and SiriusXM subscription.   As of yesterday Alexa could not find any songs I asked her to play. I’ve disabled the skill and linked the account several dozen times with no luck. My SiriusXM works just fine. Apple Music however will not work.  Any ideas? And no I’m not switching to amazon music unlimited
Seriously its so annoying and kills the vibe every-time. I don't need alexa to announce which device she is playing from. Anyway to turn this off?
So am I doing something wrong or is Yi Camera skill not working?  I can link the devices but I can't turn on or off he cameras via voice or automation

"I wanted to set up a routine with a couple of podcasts every day, but I cannot figure how to only get that day's episode. I have tried the Music &amp; Media option with both Amazon Music and TuneIn, and in both cases it plays three or four episodes. I added the phrase ""the most recent"" at the beginning of the ""Play"" command, but all that did was play the most recent one first, then go backwards from there.  I have both the Pocket Casts and Stitcher skills enabled on the Echo, but neither is available for use in Routines. Any tips on this?"
"Moin, I have a 2nd gen Echo here and it started to slow down a lot, taking several seconds after the keyword to glow and understand me, as well as not recognising the keyword even in absolute silence sometimes.

"So you can make alexa learn your voice, can you block the voice of your children or is the only benefit of learning your voice that she can call you by name?"
"I have multiple Google assistants throughout my house but was recently gifted an Echo Show for my birthday. Admittedly I'm not as familiar with Alexa as I am with Google's ecosystem, but linking my Hue lights, TP-Link smart plugs, and Roku TV was very straightforward, as was adding all the various devices and scenes to the proper rooms.  Half an hour ago, I asked Alexa to turn my living room lights on, which *technically* happened, but instead of just turning the Hue lights back on to their previous color they started cycling through every color of the rainbow, *plus* Alexa turned my TV on as well as a light in my dining room. I couldn't even get the lights to stop cycling through colors - turning them off via Alexa just had them turn on &amp; cycle again, and the same thing happened via Google Home and the Hue app. The only thing that stopped the color cycling was going into Hue Labs and toggling the colorloop formula on &amp; off (side note: the colorloop formula was showing as inactive while the lights were cycling through colors).  Any idea as to why this would have happened? All the Hue living room lights are correctly named and set in the living room in the Alexa app, as are the Hue scenes. I'm completely mystified as to why Alexa even turned the TV on."
"Just had a bizarre Alexa experience... It randomly started playing music without me asking. When I told it to stop, it had a red ring indicating no internet connection and said ""Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now""... So how on earth was it streaming music, what was it and where was it coming from?!? Pulled the power out the back and reset it, then it was back to normal. Really weird!"
"I am really disappointed by the recent additional decline in all areas of Alexa responses, audio streams stopping (BBC Sounds), devices not responding even though I'm 0.5 meters away, echo show 5 now being utterly useless at responding unless I'm directly in front of another device across the room, all questions are misunderstood, WHY?!? These devices used to be awesome and now are close to ALL going in the bin. Such a shame. :("
For context I don’t even think I listened to the full song. My mom uses “my music” whenever she wants her country. I’m gonna stop playing songs off my Alexa but will the “my music” list always be tainted or no?
"So I heard that the tradeoff of getting the dot over the regular echo would be worse speakers, which I do not mind anyway since I prefer listening to music on flat powered monitors. Would connecting the dot to one of my audio interfaces line inputs allow allow music to play through my monitors instead of the built in speaker? Thank you"
"These days, I mostly use Alexa as an alarm clock, daily podcast player, and occasionally a calculator. And yet, at least twice a month, when I tell her to set up 2 morning alarms, instead of just ""alarm set for 7am,"" I also get ""by the way, would you like me to (random feature thing)"" or ""by the way, did you know that I can (random new feature thing)?""  ...I do not enjoy yelling ""shut the fuck up"" at my overpowered alarm clock, but I really, **really** don't care about those new features. I want to be able to disable that annoying ""oh, btw :) "" routine. If I ever get so bored that I want to hear my appliance's new features, I'll explicitly ask for it - right after I finish reading my toaster's instruction manual, and other fascinating activities that rank higher than this."
"I’ll keep it simple, my songs keep playing off My moms “my music” mostly just my metal which she doesn’t care about. But once or twice I listened to songs that she would not like on the Alexa is there any guarantee these will/won’t play.  Tl:dr will Alexa play anime themes if I listened to them once."
"Anyone else have a problem with this? I try and Alexa responds “sorry, I’m having trouble, please try in a little while”."
"I have a “Living room” group containing:  - Sonos Beam with Alexa enabled - 3 lights  The Sonos Beam is connected to my TV, so if I say “Alexa turn the TV on/off”, that’s what happens.  If I say “Alexa turn on/off the lights” it works perfectly.  However if I say “Alexa turn on/off the Living room lights” or “turn on/off the lights in the Living room”, it will control the lights, but it will also turn the TV on/off as well.  I’ve tried renaming devices so they don’t have “Living room” in their name, but it makes no difference.  The only thing that seems to stop it is if I remove the Sonos beam from the group entirely. But that then stops “Alexa turn off/on the lights” from working seamlessly as she then responds asking which lights I mean.  Anyone know how I can fix this?"
"I let the dog out at 5 AM but I have a routine to announce each window and door open/close on all alexa devices and the sounds wake up my wife and children, is there a way to modify or mute the announcements from ring for 15 mins while I do this? I don't want it to be an automatic thing, I would prefer a spoken command to trigger the mute event."
"I would like to add my Ecobee4 thermostat to my 'everywhere' speaker group, but Alexa will not identify the ecobee as a smart speaker when I scan for it. I have two echos that are detected, but no luck on the ecobee. To confirm, they are all on the same 5ghz network. The ecobee will play spotify independently (I can choose it as a speaker on Spotify). Any thoughts? Thanks team!"
is there anyway to set the delay below 5? like with the use of a skill or something? i’m trying to transfer my “tap-to-run” automations over to alexa but i can’t seem to set the delay below .
Obviously frustrating that Amazon haven’t enabled Siri support to have it control the app yet but I’m curious if it’s at all possible to for Amazon to implement Alexa into the Amazon Music CarPlay app like they have in the regular iOS app.   Would help while driving when using the app directly in CarPlay! 🤔
Is there a way to turn off the absolutely absurd censorship that alexa has. Why in god awful hell would you censor anatomical names for body parts. Anus/rectum are censored for some unknown reason
"This morning, my wife mentioned to our son that if he didn't get out of bed and get ready for school, she was going to get the ""accordion.""*  When she sat down at her computer an hour or so later and opened amazon.com, one of the recommendation strips of items was musical instruments and the first item was an actual accordion.  I thought Alexa didn't listen to what you were saying unless you said her name first. In fact I'm pretty sure they promised that. My wife and I are seriously thinking about disconnecting the eavesdropping little bastages.  Has anyone else noticed this behavior?  *""The accordion"" reference is an inside family joke: when the kids were little my son grabbed his toy, functional accordion and used it to wake me up when I would fall asleep during the day. He did this once in a while for a long period of time and it became a running joke. I did not appreciate the humor. (until now)"
"I have a couple of different light scenes I tell alexa sometimes.      Ex: one would turn the lights to soft white at 50%, another one will turn the lights cyan at 30%.   I have named these scenes as    Scene 1, scene 2, scene 3, etc but I noticed that alexa has a hard time recognizing my voice when I say something like ""scene 1"" -- it thinks I'm saying ""C.N.N. 1"". I have also tried using Mode 1,2,3, but alexa thinks I'm saying ""mod 1"" instead.   Does anyone have suggestions for recognizable alexa commands that they use for this purpose, and what word do you use?"
Is anyone else having issues using Bluetooth streaming to Echos from iPhones using iOS 14. It take a while for my echo to start the Bluetooth stream of music.
It's only the wife's account.  1. Turned off everything we could in the Alexa App 2. She disabled notifications in her Amazon app. 3. Didn't work so she completely unlinked Alexa from her Amazon account.  Any leads on how to disable these notifications?

I really want Alexa to remember stuff that isnt a reminder. If I'm working and I want her to remember a certain name or number while I search for something else.  Or Saying Alexa Remember my keys are in the kitchen drawer. And then asking later Alexa where are my keys?   I looked it up online and apparently she does do this but is it just a US thing? I'm in the UK and she wont do it at all.  Lately it seems she does less and less and I've just won a free google nest mini so she's on her last chances.
"Hello, this has been an on going issue for months and I've finally just had it. I will get mobile push notifications for these reminders when I'm not home. I have daily reminders for our son doing home school. Some days he will get so engrossed he forgets to eat lunch etc.  But days like today he's with his grandparent. But to set the reminders up again is an inconvenience. If I have to do that I will. But this didnt used to happen. I used to always have two echos and we got a third and when we just had 2 it wasn't a big deal. But its becoming an issue now.   Is this just something I have to deal with or is there a solution?"
"Alexa always says reminders 2x, is there a way for her to only say a reminder 1x? I love being able to set up reminders for my kids remote schooling and regular daily reminders, but her repeating every single one is kind of annoying. I haven’t been able to find a way to adjust this feature."
Was just curious what people were thinking about Amazon's new design direction and where your loyalties lay.   [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/j1eqvh)
"This may be a dumb question. I almost exclusively use Alexa to listen to music, and set timers while cooking. My gf doesn't like the idea of having an Alexa in the house due to privacy reasons, which I can respect, but I'd still like to have the convenience of a voice commanded device that can play music for me through my Spotify. Does something like this exist?"
"Hey all.  So we have a few alexa devices (show / dots) around the house that we really like.  We just got some hue lights that we were messing with but the biggest issue we ran into was that when we set the lights up on 1 profile, the other person can't control the lights unless they change profiles.  I did some googling and saw Alexa Households and i was going to try that but when i got into my account settings i don't see the option there.   Basically we want to have our lists / calendars / etc be on our own profiles so we can get that information but things like music (have amazon music and spotify) and our smart lights sync between the 2 profiles.  We thought about just adding them to both profiles but then we run the issue of if we make changes to the groupings on 1 profile we have to make sure they're the same on the 2nd profile.    Is there any way to do this that im just missing?"
"So long story short, a family member got echo dots for my grandmother and I to help my grandmother since she has trouble walking; the dots are for her to call us whenever she needs something. I check on my grandmother numerous times a day and my bedroom is right next to hers, I keep my door open at all times. But this family member insisted and got one for me anyways. I really don't feel comfortable about it and all of the dots are connected to their main Alexa, so they can drop in whenever they want to my dot without me knowing. Is their a way for me to disable drop in from their alexa and have only my grandmother be able to use the drop in feature?"

Often ask Alexa to pause when the radio commercials come on.  When I remember I ask it to un-pause.    I've tried asking to pause for a set time (eg. 2 mins) with the hope it automatically un-pause...but it just stays paused.  Any good command?

Hello... trying to setup a solution to my problem. I have a switch for some lights that I need to be on all the time (provides power to my Ring camera).

"I want Alexa to be able to connect to each of my devices on command. But when ever I set up my laptop Bluetooth with Alaxa, it thinks its a phone. So now my iPhone isn't connected.   How can I make it so Alexa can differentiate between my laptop and iPhone on command?

Also Can I make is so Alexa doesn't announce its connecting / disconnecting everytime?"
"I was reading an earlier post about Alexa giving the wrong weather info.  They mentioned their address was on a court so their address ends in “ct.”. Mine does as well.  Alexa is parsing that address as “Connecticut.”  Alexa, what city am I in? *Reno, Nevada*  Alexa, what’s the current temperature? *Currently, it is 67 degrees fahrenheit*  Alexa, what is the current temperature in Reno, Nevada? *Currently, it is 83 degrees fahrenheit*  Whaaaaat?  Alexa, what’s the current temperature in Connecticut? *Which city in Connecticut?*  Hartford. *Currently, in Hartford Connecticut, it is 67 degrees fahrenheit*  Alexa, what’s the current temperature? *Currently, in Hartford Connecticut, it is 67 degrees fahrenheit*  Alexa, what city am I in? *Reno, Nevada*  Alexa, what’s the current temperature? *Currently, in Hartford Connecticut, it is 67 degrees fahrenheit*  Great.

"Hey everyone,   Has anyone been experiencing issues with their Echo device calling up radio stations on radio.com? I've tried 1010 WINS and WFAN w/o success (Alexa: sorry, I can't find the radio station you requested). The issue started happening w/in the past 24 hours and removing/re-adding the radio.com skill doesn't resolve the issue.   Anyone else experience something similar or have ideas on how to resolve?"
"Hey everyone,  I'm from Germany and really annoyed by the audio Bundesliga stream which can be heard by the Echo via Alexa.  I've got a first-gen Amazon Echo and two fairly new Echo Dot.

If you ask alexa to go onto choose punishment ask her to choose a punishment for dad then ask her to choose a punishment for mum. It says dad is perfect but when you say mum it still chooses a punishment.
"I only use my Alexa as a Bluetooth speaker and if I don't play sound for about 15 minutes and then hit play it blasts ""Now playing from X's Macbook Pro"". Anyone with this issue will understand how infuriating it is. If you are not bothered about Alexa features and just want to use Alexa as a Bluetooth speaker like me, disconnect Alexa from wifi. This will solve the problem."

"Is there a way to pass Alexa a parameter you’d like to run as part of a skill invoked by a routine?  For example, if I want to run an ambient sound skill that offers a choice of sounds, I could invoke it by voice by saying “Alexa open ambient sounds to thunderstorm.” However, if I add the skill to a routine, the only option appears to be to open the skill, and then respond by voice when Alexa asks me which sound I would like to play. Can Alexa pass that choice through as part of the routine without me having to listen and respond to a prompt?"

"I don't want my Alexa Show to tell or show me anything except a slide show of some of my photos.    I have the slide show set up and I am happy with it.  I have everything else turned off.  But every few weeks, I start getting other crap I don't want.  Suggestions, etc.  I go into home screen settings and... whaddya know, some of the crap has been turned back on.  I suppose Amazon pushes out an update and that triggers the change back to me getting content I don't want.  Is it possible to lock in the home settings so none of that stuff starts popping up after an update?"
"So this is stupidly small, petty, and first-world-problem-ish, but man, does it annoy me: when you change your time zone on Alexa, you have to also change the times on all your routines. But not alarms.  Example: the coffee pot is set to start at 5:50am. The boys morning alarm is set for 8:15am When we move from Mountain time to Central time, I have to manually go into the app and change the location from Colorado to North Dakota. That adjusts the time zone so that the alarm goes off at 8:15am Central and not an hour later. So far, this makes sense. EXCEPT now the coffee pot routine starts at 6:50am Central. And I have to go edit EVERY. FLIPPING. ROUTINE. to get the times back to what I set them to be.  It is such terrible UX."

"Alexa's voice seems to be significantly quieter than music.  I am using Apple Music with external speakers connected to an Echo Dot.

I have a device (c by ge) switch I just got and I’d like for when I turn on X switch Alexa will trigger and then on other devices.   I know I can add a group (I have this for a lot ) and use voice, but I’d like Alexa to do it on its own."

"A few years ago I added a reminder. It was a prediction of what would happen in the future. I can ask Alexa about my upcoming reminders, but can I find out when I actually added that reminder anywhere in the Alexa app, amazon site, or any other way?

"Alexa won't play the film version (1973) of Jesus Christ Superstar, I've said it a dozen ways. She just plays the original cast recording in '69.  She knows it exists because I asked about all the different versions and she listed it, dammit! Anyone have the magic Jesus words?"
"The title is a good summary I think.  A local home depot shop has a sale, that includes some light strips of the company ""Tint"" (Mueller Licht) but those are Zigbee based.

Most rooms are equipped with simple dots (3rd generation, I'm sure those don't have zigbee support) but for the living room I still use a 2018 Gen. 1 Echo Plus, this huge black tower thing. Doing it's job since they were available for buying here in my country.  Before going shopping and getting some light strips, I have a couple of projects on my mind, I would like to know if I need additional equiptment but seemingly google isn't really helpful..."

"I've bought and set up an Alex Echo Show 8 for my elderly mother (see previous post!). Figured most things out, but I've searched and can't find a good answer to this:  When she first stated ""Alexa, call \[myname\]"" it asks whether she wants my Alexa Device. After that it usually automatically connects to my device (in this case, the Alexa app on my phone). However, I just tested it with her again, and it asked (paraphrasing) ""last time you called to his Device, do you want to do this again?"". This will absolutely confuse her when I am not here. Is there a way to set the Echo up so it *only ever* calls me at my app? Perhaps I can remove my phone number from her contact for me? (I've tried, but there doesn't seem to be a way).      Thanks again!"
"Thanks to advice from this sub and others, I have purchased an Echo Show 8 for my elderly mother who is terrified of technology. So far so good, but I want to set up a couple of things before I depart abroad:     1. **Reminders/Alarms.** I want to set up two daily reminders that display the message (or better yet Alexa speaks out loud) *""take your medicine""*. I know I can do this with the reminder command, but it only gently beeps at her twice. An alarm is better in that it is more insistent, but is there a way of ""naming"" the alarms so ""take your medicine"" appears on the screen? How long will it keep ringing for and is there anyway of setting this? Or is it possible to make the reminder beep louder at her and for longer?    2. **Adding contacts.** I have created an Amazon account for her and added it to my ""Household"". Her account is the one logged into on the Echo Show. Does this mean I can add contacts to her account from my phone (when logged in as her). ie. she won't have to do anything at all?     3. **Video call by default**. When calling a new contact, Alexa asks if you want to call their Alexa Device. Mum is gonna get confused by this. Is there any way to set up the Echo so it always calls by video, even on the first time?     TIA!"
Hi all. Thought I’d ask in here although it’s more of a tv problem than Alexa.   My TV (Sony Bravia) is connected to a Sonos Beam. For 12 months I could turn TV on and off fine with voice control but about 6 months ago I had an update on my TV and since then it’s been like the TV properly shuts down so won’t turn on using voice control. I have to use the remote and it takes about 2 mins to boot up going through all the Android loading process.   I can then turn it off fine once it’s on.   I’ve turned off all settings on TV to do with eco mode and everything and still had no luck resolving the issue. Anyone else had similar problems?

Because of this , they can get left on for days   There has to be a way to develop a skill, something , ANYTHING where Alexa checks lights in a certain room , if on , and if they’ve been on for longer than X , asks if we’re still in the room .  Based on the response , should leave them on or shut them off   Any thoughts on how to go about this? Examples ?"
"You should be able to set Alexa so that alarms have to be physically turned off by pressing the Action button on the device.    This way, I can set it by voice command and have it positioned across the room, and when I wake up I actually have to get out of bed to turn it off.  It's too easy right now to just turn it off while laying in bed.    If this is already possible let me know."

And when motion is not detected for 15 min turn of automatically. I noticed that every time there is motion which is around very 5 seconds it is sending me a notification.   Is their a way that i can set it so that it does not repeat again until another routine plays? Or wait to repeat until no motion is detected for 15 minutes.

Any help will be GREATLY appreciated!!!!"
Potentially dumb question but does Alexa need to be on the same frequency as a smart lightbulb I’m trying to control?   So like my Alexa won’t work if it’s on a 5 GHz frequency and the bulb is on the 2.4 GHz frequency on the same dual band router?
I have a device the same name as some newly added skill and can no longer control the device since Alexa just tells me I don't have that skill enabled. I don't need some useless skill no one has heard of. I just want to keep controlling the devices I have.  Every few months a new app gets added and I have to rename some device. Ina few years once the app store is full we won't be able to use alexa at all because it will just enable apps. What's the point.
She definitely has it turned on but never whispers back. I have no idea what to do to fix this.
"So I was able to connect my phone number to the Alexa app- which allows me to place calls through the Alexa assistant from my phone number- but only through the Alexa app and not my phones phone application     I also am unable completely to send SMS messages from my phone despite giving Alexa permissions to make calls, use sms and see contacts- it replies ""I can send a message to contacts who have Alexa messaging enabled""     id like to use Alexa as my default assistant but if I cannot easily tell my phone- TEXT MIKEY HE IS AWESOME then im forced to stick with the google assistant in order to have this functionality     is there something I am missing here or a suitable workaround?"
So I live in a city with a special character in the name. Think like Piñon City. Starting a couple weeks ago Alexa is no longer giving me the right weather information. I have no idea what weather she’s giving me but it’s always 15 degrees off. If I ask her “where am I” she gives the correct info.   If I give her the city next door as my location she has it correct.   If I ask her “what’s the temperature in Piñon City Florida” she gives the correct info  I’ve looked every single place in the app and in my Amazon account and my location is correct. I’ve tried both with and without the ñ and tried Pinyon cause some people spell it that way.   I’m out of things to try. Any idea?
"Not sure whether it's a Ring problem or an Alexa one so I'll ask here first. The various devices I have no longer announce or chime when someone is at the door. I've done all the usual uninstall, unlink accounts and resets by nothing works. I notice a couple of people have mentioned it in the reviews, anyone else having issues?"
Unable to review skills on Alexa iPhone app
"I have hundreds of dollars in Hue light bulbs in my house. Around 9/14 all went to unresponsive. Based on the reviews of the Hue skill in Alexa, this happened to hundreds of people.  I can't seem to find a solution. I don't run a Hue Bridge . I use Alexa to control all of my lights.  I absolutely love this feature . Does anyone have an answer?"
I saw the announcements this week about printing through Alexa. I’ve checked the **devices** tab On my Alexa app (iOS) and cant see anything about printers. Is this a US only thing currently (I’m in Australia).  https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2020/09/how-to-print-using-alexa/
"Hey all, so I used Google home in the past and now I have an Alexa device and I wonder if I can create a similar setup. So in Google home I created a virtual house with two virtual rooms, the living room and the bedroom. When I added my partners account I just had to send an invite and that's it, but I can't do it with Alexa. In my Alexa app I can see all the devices but my partner can't, so do I have to set up every device again in my partner's phone? That's a huge pain hahaha I appreciate any help :)"
"Hey guys, so I setup a led strip and connected it to my alexa through the magic home pro app. I'm using a tablet as a dashboard for a bunch of virtual buttons that run routines for alexa that control my house.   I'm wondering if there is a widget that is a color picker that I could use to control the color of my led strip lights. I could make buttons for all of the different colors for that light but it would be ideal of I could find a color picker widget.   Alternatively it would be great if there was a shortcut/widget to open the alexa to that devices color picker screen.  Any advice?"
"I verified that Alexa specificity heard ""turn off the lights in the kitchen.""  Kitchen has one TP-Link wall switch defined as a light, and one ceiling fan controlled by BOND with the fan's light properly defined as a light as well. Double checked under Devices, Kitchen that there's 2 Lights and 1 Switch."
Does anyone have any color changing bulb recommendations that I can use for my lights next to my garage?  I had a dusk to dawn bulb but it does so now I’m thinking it would be fun to have one that I can also the change the color of. Thanks.
"Hello! Hope someone can help me!   Just bought a lot of Amazon Echo to have one in every room in my house, so today I received a call and I was wondering if this was possible somehow...  My sister called, Alexa announced the call in all my devices, so I answer, but the call is only on the device I answered.  Is there anyway to “enter” the call with another or multiple devices? For example, I answer in the kitchen and my brother can join from his room. Or I have 3 echos in the low level of my house, can I have the call on those devices so I can move freely and talk with no problem?  Hope someone can help me! Thanks a lot!!"
"I don't understand what's going on, I have some echos and some dots and playing Spotify with all the commands and such works on every echo but I have a couple of dots, one in a spare room and another hooked up to an AVR and neither will actually play anything.  I'll give it a command to do so and it will say its doing it and then nothing and when I check the Spotify app on my phone, the dots are no longer in the devices list. I can say to the dot, ""connect to Spotify"" and it will appear in the devices list and say ""connecting"" underneath it but then disappear and continue not to work.   I've power cycled them and reset one of them to OEM and set it up from scratch and its still not working. Any ideas why the echo's work fine but the dots don't work at all?"
"My Grandpa passed away recently before lockdown happened and my Grandma has felt increasingly isolated.  Her eyesight is not great and she is becoming ""forgetful"".   I live far away (4 hours drive) so I thought a video capable device would be great.  So after doing some analysis online and comparing (Google Nest, Facebook Portal) I have gone and purchased an Alexa Show.  The purpose of this would be the following use cases:  * Alexa, call Bob/Sarah etc. * Alexa, remind me to take my pills at 6pm * Alexa play Jazz music * Alexa whats on TV tonight * Show family photos * Video call family members (Alexa app) * Panic / Alarm (not sure if this possible)  Family structure:  * Me (don't have any Alexa devices) - Amazon account * Mum (has an Alexa dot) - uses my Amazon account (Amazon family) * Granny (has Alexa show)  - not sure what to do here * Uncle Jimmy (Alexa dot) - his own Amazon account  Internet:  Alexa Show --&gt; 4G/LTE Router  When I first setup my Gran's Alexa show, it weirdly had voice messages that were sent to my Mum.  Also the Alexa had all my phone contacts which is not great.  I spoke with a technical support person and they said it *HAS* to be one mobile phone per Alexa i.e. my gran would need a smartphone, is this correct?   *Questions*  * I have setup a 4G internet account with 12GB data allowance, is that enough for this kind of usage? * How do I setup a list of contacts that are only relevant to my Grandmother, or do I need to set her up with an Amazon account? * If I set her up with an Amazon account, is there an easy way to remotely update the photos that show on the Alexa? * Is there a way for Alexa to detect activity to know that my Grandmother is ok, and is active? * Any apps or skills you can recommend?"
 In testing a routine with Messaging/Announcement it appears to not work with Freetime enabled devices. If I disable Freetime it works. Is this by design? Is there a way around it?    I'm trying to set up some daily household announcements and it seems the only solution is to set up an Alexa says routine for each device. That's a PITA
"I'm looking to track certain actions and measurements each day.  I'd like to have the data available as a spreadsheet, but I don't want to have to always open up the spreadsheet to add to it.  It would be easier to say something like ""Alexa add one candy bar to tally"" and have her log it for the day.  Also, being able to add measurements would be good though that could be a separate skill/app.  It wouldn't be at ally, but rather a weekly measurement I want to keep track of.  So, something like ""Alexa, add 10 pounds to tracker for today.""  What would you suggest to handle this?"
"I’ve got a weird recurring problem.  Our echo in the kitchen hears a query, but light goes on, but then the response comes from another room.  This happens about 50% of the time.  I’ve removed all the groups on the account, they’re just listed as standalone speakers.  Am just about ready to give up."
"I say Alexa. Blue light. I say ""Alexa, play 'this song by whoever'.""  Alexa: Playing ""Requested Song"" by ""Whoever""  Alexa: \*turns off\*  &amp;#x200B;  Why is this?"
"I recently purchased a couple of Yeelight bulbs and have unfortunately realized that I am unable to link them to my Alexa app. I am able to control them completely with the Yeelight app however. In any case, I realized that through IFTTT I am able to control the bulbs with Alexa. For example, one of the IFTTT functions I found allows me to say ""Alexa turn off Yeelight"" and this turns sends the command from Alexa to IFTTT which then sends the command to my Yeelight bulbs. Essentially, IFTTT can detect my bulbs and Alexa can send commands to IFTTT to control the bulbs (but Alexa can't detect the bulbs directly).  I was wondering if it's possible to create my own IFTTT functions to do a bunch of other things with my bulb. Things like turning on specific lights based on their names or activating scenes with my voice. Obviously this would've been a lot simpler if Alexa still worked with the Yeelight app but I don't think this is still the case."
i would like to be able to say Alexa play music on the Sony... Or  any ideas? I am guessing it would-be with an electric outset adapter?
"Ok so I live with my girlfriend, and she has an alexa. It's hers, she programmed it. I use it to do things like turn on the lights and stuff, but my name has never been ""set up"" with alexa...  Just now, I asked it to to turn off the lights and then, as I always do, said ""thank you, alexa."" To which alexa responded...""you're welcome, Ben."" NEITHER OF US HAS EVER TOLD ALEXA MY NAME. I said ""Alexa, what is my name?"" And alexa responded ""I'm talking to Ben. This is Nadine's account.""  What. The. Fuck? Has this happened to anyone else? How does it know my name? I checked her Alexa app, she never set it up with my name. What happened?"
"I have two daily reminders set up in my account, to announce from all devices and send a notification to my phone. One at 8am and one at 8pm. They are both the same thing, a reminder to give my dog his medicine. The morning reminder works fine, the evening reminder doesn't seem to do anything. Last night I wasn't at the house at 8 pm, and it DID send a reminder to my phone. But when I'm home, there's nothing for the evening reminder. This has been happening for a few days, and I've tried deleting and remaking the reminder several times.   Any ideas as to why the one reminder isn't working or suggestions to get it working correctly? When I ask her what my next reminder is, she does include the evening reminder in the list. She just doesn't actually make the reminder at the appropriate time."
"Last night I was listening to a playlist I made through Amazon music. Today when I asked her to shuffle it, she keeps suggesting playlists I don't want. She doesn't seem to know that this playlist exists. Amazon music is playing just fine through its own app, in a few different platforms. But not Alexa.  Everything else is working correctly. Anyone? Any ideas?"
"I just tried out the new Samuel L Jackson Wake Word. It works great. Does anyone know if ""Samuel"" is, or will be available for routines? I only see the ""Echo"" wake word when creating new routines. Is there a master setting I need to change?

I have a contact in my contact list that I can't get to connect with an Alexa call. That SAME contact is listed under the drop in button with a slightly different name and communication DOES work (with my mobile app). I cannot seem to connect to that one from my Echo Show though. Any advice on how to rectify this?
"Here’s some context.  I have Apple Music, and I have set it up so Apple Music is tied to my Alexa account.  Anyway, this is something that I’ve been suspicious of for a while.  When I ask my Alexa to play a song that happens to only be included with Amazon Music Unlimited, she tells me that she can’t play the song because I don’t have Amazon Music Unlimited.  However, when I tell her to play THAT EXACT SAME SONG via Apple Music, she says that she can’t find any songs by that name or by that artist.  Of course, this is not true.  Sometimes, she even corrupts the song title or artist name, no matter how clearly I speak them!  I’m no conspiracy theorist, but I think this is Amazon’s cheap ploy to get you to purchase Amazon Music Unlimited.  What do you guys think, and have you had any similar experiences?"
Is there a way I can set a timer in the kitchen (for example) that will also sound on my other echo dots around the house?
"Hi googled with no result so asking experts here.  The wife and I have been using the term  Alexa Countdown 5 minutes,  for a couple of years, and suddenly this doesnt work.  We need to say, Alexa set a timer for 5 minutes.  Does anyone know if this has changed or is it just us ? or is there a setting Ive mucked up ??"
"I asked Alexa to set an alarm for tomorrow at 4PM.  She replied, ""OK, it sounds like you are going to bed.  Would you like me to play some relaxing ambient sounds for you?""  So I guess that's a neat new feature... could be nice...  Also, WTF??? It's 8PM, Alexa!  Are you assuming I'm about to pass out unconscious for 20 hours?"
"Trying to figure out how to have a routine shuffle a playlist. Here's my settings. What do I need to change?  Name: Play Quiet Blues When you say: Alexa, play quiet Blues Alexa will: Play ""Playlist Quiet Blues"" on Spotify  This routine works for the playlist, but always starts with the first song and plays in order. I'd like this routine to always shuffle the songs."
"Hey all!  I’m getting cross with Google!  My wife and I love going to sleep with a Thunderstorm sounds. I’ve now set up a routine in Alexa to turn all lights off, set the volume and then turn the “Skill” thunderstorm sounds on. But I can’t for the life of me work out how to make it only play for 2 hours... anyone got any ideas?!  I tried doing it with Spotify but it does select the right thunderstorm sounds...  Thanks for help!"
"We have Amazon prime and we have an echo at our house. We have two echo dots at my dad's house on the same account. This has worked out great because I have a 445 am alarm for him set up on this for that I can move around when his appointments get moved. He can also call us using voice commands and I can set up reminders for him.  The issue is that we have Spotify linked and he will start randomly listening to Spotify. When he does this it turns off what we are listening to.  If there a way to have the devices, at his house, restricted to our spotify and just use Amazon music?"
"Is there a way to set the “Alarm is dismissed” routine to run only on the device that the alarm is activated for?   I had this routine set for my own Echo until I bought another one for my mum. Now when she dismisses her alarm, the routine runs on my Echo (waking me up)."
If I wanted a device to turn on/off using a smart plug based on some internal or external temperature?
When I dismiss an alarm I have a routine to play the weather. Only problem is both my kids have an alarm as well and it plays the weather 3x's! 2x's for each of their alarms and a 3rd time for mine. Is there a way to make the routine play the weather only once after my alarm is dismissed? Haven't found a way to do it.
"Does anyone have an issue where when listening to the Radio (BBC Radio 2) the playback just stop randomly. If I ask Alexa to ""Play Radio 2"" again, it responds with ""Playing Radio 2"" etc.. but nothing happens, just silence. It will stay like that forever and I have to do a power cycle to solve the issue.  Is this a hardware issue with my Alexa (1st gen)? I've not notice it happen with my Echo dot or the 2nd generation Alexa I have in a different location.  Just wondering if I'm alone, or if there is any fix I can try to solve it?"
"I am unable to tell Alexa to start any of my custom playlists. I have tried ""Alexa play x Playlist"", ""Alexa play my x Playlist"", ""Alexa play x Playlist on Spotify"". Instead it would just play a public Playlist off Spotify with a similar title. My Playlist titles are My Jams, 70s-80s, 90s, 2000s. None of them want to work was wondering if anyone has had a similar problem and found a solution to it?"
"I gave an echo dot to my child, but just realized that it became a mistake: it just can play any kind of songs including those that are not appropriate for children. I searched for explicit filter, but it seems that it only works in US. Just wonder if there are workarounds outside of US? if not, then I have to say that Echo is not suitable for children (or even family with children) use..."
"I have an Alexa dot and 3 Feit electric LED lights. After a pain of a time connecting the lights to the app and having Alexa learn the Feit skill, my light finally connected. I can control the lights from the app and they work with the ""Alexa, goodnight"" and ""Alexa, let there be light"" routines but no individual names work! I have created several groups including bedroom, basement, living room, and even light and lights, and none have worked. I have also named the lights individually ranging from ""bedside light"" to ""left"" and Alexa doesn't recognize any of them. What can I do?!"
"I gave my daughter an Echo Dot I was no longer using. I deregistered it, she took it to another state and registered it under her name. Now Alexa thinks I’m her. It is not listed under my Amazon account, but it is listed as a device in my Alexa app. The app does state it is registered to her, and all the other devices on the app state they are registered to me.  I feel like I’m missing something super simple- help!"
"Hi all, I hope this is the right sub. My grandfather asked me to look into Alexa for him as his brother mentioned it as a way to use his magic jack phone system. I have little to no experience with either system Alexa or Magic Jack.   I told him I would look into it and see if there are any other features that would work well for him. He is a recent widower and I am looking to try and make any aspect of his life a little easier.   So my question to this sub is there anyone that has experience with Magic Jack and Alexa and if so how has it worked for you? as well as is there any other features Alexa can do that would make his day to day like easier?   Thanks in advance."
"It's blinking 3 times blue, which according to online means it disconnected from my echo. The issue is it is connected just fine, timers work well, the time is always accurate it just sits there and every 3-5 minutes blinks blue 3 times. Sometimes just blinks blue once. Idk. I'm worried it's just wasting my batteries"
"In the last hour or so I've gotten several echo-to-echo calls and they no longer ""pick up"" when I say ""Echo, answer."" The echo registers and the light turns blue but the ""answer"" doesn't and it goes back to green and continues ringing. I now have to say ""echo, answer the call"" for it to finally pick up.  I've done the usual unplugging fixes. Obviously my internet is fine as the calls are working. I don't know how this would affect it but the Alexa App on my phone that I used to set them all up is updated.  This may not seem like a big deal but I'm the live in caretaker for 2 elderly people and if at night they call me for help my still muddled sleep mind may still say ""echo answer"" and it won't do anything and I may fall back asleep without talking to them."
"A week or so ago, I bought an Alexa for my mom. Meanwhile mine just arrived at my place.  As I understand it, I should be able to call/communicate with hers, right? But I'm having trouble finding the functionality anywhere.  Is there a tutorial somewhere showing how to set up me calling hers?"
"With school back in session I go every second day, but then the next week I go the days that I didn’t go the week before. So for example if one week I go Monday, Wednesday and Friday the next I’ll go Tuesday and Thursday. Is there’s way to have the alarm go on the days I’m going to school, and not go off on the days I’m not? Or would it have to be manual or the same time everyday regardless?"
"As specified in my previous post made around a week ago, my Alexa does not respond when I ask it questions. It turns blue, but does not answer. Before commenting any solutions please read my other post as I may have already tried it :). But since then I have tried other options such as trying a new outlet in my room, trying it in different rooms around the house and I have even factory reset it, all to no avail. I’ve sent an email to amazon in the help and feedback part of the app and am waiting for a response.   Has anyone had a problem like this before?  Many thanks, Booglehoop"
"Disclaimer: This is a complicated (≈10min) and somewhat clunky workaround, but I haven't found any other solutions, so here you go. (Only for Android).  What you'll need:  Amazon Alexa app with smart plug registered. Macrodroid app IFTTT app  Directions:  Part 1.  Connect IFTTT with Google Assistant (figure it out). Click links below to add the necessary applets  https://ifttt.com/applets/QDR3tgxW  https://ifttt.com/applets/cvt5ZeyK  Macrodroid:  Get all permissions Under 'Templates,' search for 'Amazon Smart Plug'  Add both the ""on"" and ""off"" versions  Part 2.  In both of the IFTTT 'applets' that you added, you will need to change the text fields (set as ""guitar on/guitar off"" etc) to whatever you want to say to your Google Assistant. It will work regardless.  In Macrodroid, go to edit each of the Macros, and, under 'Speak text' in the action section, edit ""amp"" to the name of your smart plug.  Execution: Now, when you say ""turn on smart plug"" (or whatever you set the IFTTT applet to be) to the Google Assistant, IFTTT will show the notification ""On"", which will cause Macrodroid to open the 'Ask Alexa' shortcut and speak the text ""Hey, turn, on, ______""  Notes:  *When Macrodroid speaks the text, it uses Alarm Volume *You may need to add filler text before ""hey, turn, on, ______"" in Macrodroid depending on how quickly the Ask Alexa shortcut launches on your phone *This will only work when your phone screen is on, although it will speak the text regardless."
"Is there any reason why I would be getting notified when Guard is set to home or away but NOT be getting notified of an alarm being sounded?

"Hi all, I know that this has been asked before but I'm having a terrible time setting up MRM on my two alexa devices (echo dot 3rd gen and echo 3rd gen). When I go to set up the MRM, I can choose one of the two speakers and the other displays a network error ""Check network connection: make sure that your devices are on the same wifi network. guest networks are not recommended.""  &amp;#x200B;  I have done the following to troubleshoot:  * Unplugged both devices, left them for several hours, then plugged back in * Did a reset by holding down the circle button and adding them again to the same wifi * Reset my router * Changed their wifi network from 5.0ghz to 2.4ghz to see if that did anything * Checked my router settings (TPLink router, Verizon internet) and nothing sticks out  * Called alexa support and went through these same steps with them  Did anyone have this issue and resolve it? I feel like I have run out of things to try. I recently moved in August, and had previously been able to play music across both devices at my previous apartment by just grouping them (no MRM), so it is a recent issue. Any thoughts?? TIA!"

Same problem on holidays when I don't want to get up at 0520, or if I'm out of town and don't want my roommate messaging me that my alarm has been going off.

Hello! I’m listening to an audiobook on Libby on my phone and want to pass it off to Alexa to play but can’t see how to do it. Does anyone know how to do this? Thank you!
"I wanted to test if Alexa can turn off smart home appliances within a certain time, by saying:  ""Akexa, turn off speaker in one hour.""  It then told me it set a ""sleep timer"". Now what the hell is it and how do I turn it off? My timer and reminder lists are empty, and yet I get a countdown when I ask when my sleep timer is. When I then ask to remove it, I get told ""there are no timers set"". This is one kafkesque fucking robot."
"I have new WAP (Engenius WAP1300) for this part of the house.  Standard SSID in the house has always been BLANK.  Echo Flex kept dropping connection on BLANK.  So I tried to create a new 2.4 only SSID - ""BLANK2.4"".  It still dropped connection.  So I broke out an old 2.4 only AP, set the SSID to BLANK2.4 and disabled BLANK2.4 on the Engenius and tried that.  Now I've realized it might not even have been the Engenius' fault because no matter what I do in the Alexa Android App is still connects to BLANK.  I've made the light orange and tried changing the SSID numerous times.  Other Echos in other parts of the house have never had a problem with BLANK or with the other Engenius now running BLANK.  How can I erase BLANK from this Flex' options?"

"Hi everybody,   I'm facing a very strange and irritating problem.   I've set a couple of routines of which particularly 2 are creating a lot of problems. The first one is the default ""Let there be light"" command which switches on all the lights in the room. More often than not, Alexa doesn't recognise the command but starts playing a song of that particular name. Quite infuriating lol   The second command is called ""Alternate Movie Mode"", in which all lights except for 2, change to a dim turquoise colour and the TV Bias Lighting switches on as well. But this command never works. Alexa just informs me that modes are not supported at the moment, which is surprising since I have another routine labelled ""Movie Mode"" that works absolutely fine every time.  Any idea why this is at all happening. These are not complex commands just simple 4 to 5 worded phrases which should work but it confuses the heck out of Alexa."

"I'm having a very annoying problem that I hope someone can help me with. When I first set up my Alexa device a couple years ago, I lived in Brazil so the location was initially set to there. Now I moved to Canada and I'm settling it up again. I did a hard reset on the device and even though I'm using the same account as before, I already updated the account settings to the new Canada location. Everything seems fine but when I go into the Skill store, for some reason it's still using the Brazilian store. I looked at all the possible location settings but I can't find anything missing. I found this post: https://uk.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D54P00006zSlvoSAC/alexa-skills-from-the-wrong-country but I can't find that Country Settings they talk about, not in mobile nor using a PC.

"Hey there Alexacons, was looking for a light switch capability that could turn on/off more than just the light physically wired into the panel. For example, going into a room hitting the switch and having every light turn on, not just the one wired into the light switch.

Perhaps I could do this through an Event Driven routine; e.g. ‘When Switch_Bedroom = ON do the following.’ Thoughts guys?"

"Hello!  I use Alexa primarily to play CBC Radio 1 Vancouver.  She does this through TuneIn, who have recently started blocking all stations outside the UK (where I am), and so I have to use MyTuner instead.  However, I can't set an alarm to MyTuner, and I used to wake up with CBC Radio 1 Vancouver, so is there any way this can be done?  I've tried changing my location/timezone to the Republic of Ireland but it hasn't worked...  Thanks!"
How do I get Alexa to stop announcing every time I airdrop something from my iPhone to my iMac?  It also happens occasionally when I empty the trash on my iMac.  It is very annoying as I forget that it happens and then startled a bit when it does.  Currently I have an echo dot paired to both the phone and computer.  Any help is appreciated.
"I got an echo show for my grandpa so I can do drop in video chatting during Covid. It works for him since he doesn’t have many tech abilities. The problem is that he has a hard time hearing. I’ve noticed that google hangouts has good live captioning, but I don’t see an Alexa feature for this. Anyone know if there’s a way to use google hangout for drop in video chat on Echo show? Thanks for any advice"
"It’s only started in the last 10 days or so.  Is this built in obsolescence?  Also, she’s always been a bit fade-outy when playing the radio through her."
"The two types seem to be inextricably linked (i.e., when we ask her to play our liked songs, she says “Ok, playing your Liked and Most Played songs”). There are two big problems with that: 1) we have a multiuser household, and we don’t all like the same kind of music—we’re using the ‘Like’ feature to curate a group of songs we all enjoy, but we listen to very different music when not together; and 2) including our Most Played songs means things like sleep sounds/meditation music will be played when we’re just trying to listen to music.  TIA for any tips or advice!"
"I recently got 2 3rd gen dots, and have one in my bedroom and one in my living room and have them both connected to the same wifi network, but when I go to connect them for multi room music, whichever one I don't click on says ""network error"" and greys out.   What am I doing wrong? Can two dots not do multi room music?  Thank you!"
"I’m looking into making my house into a smart home since I’m quickly losing function in my body. However I really don’t know the first thing about all of this fancy dancy smart assistant stuff. I use my iPhone 8 for literally everything right now, but I’m really curious about Amazon Alexa because of thousands of skills and games that can keep me occupied.  So here are just a few questions to get you guys started and feel free to add anything and everything that you can think of that might be helpful!  What’s the difference between the echo max, the normal echo, and the echo dot?  I’m in Canada and the Amazon website says that the echo max does not have a built-in hub but isn’t it supposed to?   What is the use of a hub? Which ones are available and what’s the difference or better ones?  What highly recommended Brands work with Alexa and my iPhone?  What kind of smart things would you recommend I look into? Lightbulbs, outlets, a thermostat, robot vacuum, curtains?  What’s the difference between Apple TV and fire stick?"
This problem is kind of a typical thing I experience with Alexa where things just randomly stop working out of nowhere after being fine for a while.   My Sonos Beam was set up fine and working with Alexa no problem since I got it a month ago. Then one day it just stops working.   The beam is powered up and fine. I can control it and play music through my phone apps and tv etc. but the Alexa app says it’s offline and can’t connect. I deleted it and tried discovering it again and no luck.   Anyone have any solutions?  I’m starting to get frustrated with Alexa in general because it’s all to often inconsistent with things constantly dropping out randomly. Like one day my fire Tv can change inputs on command and then the next it has no idea that’s even possible.
"when i pair my amazon echo to my laptop via Bluetooth it initially says ""connected"" but then immediately proceeds to switch to ""connected music"" then it wont play anything other than spotify, has anyone ran into this issue before and have a fix for it?"
I used not have to unplug alexa and plug it back in.   Ive already trien removing the skill and readding it back it didnt fix the problem.  Anything else I can try?
Is dropping in on all devices no longer supported? Or is it not available in the UK? Whenever I try to do it it says that either there is no device named all devices or there is no device named all echos. I have 4 different echos
"When Alexa finishes telling us she turned the lights off etc. she makes a sound, usually 2-3 times.  Its hard to describe.. almost like if you were on a menu for something and you selected an unavailable/wrong option.. kinda like a ""Deh-Dun"". Just started happening randomly. Been using her for at least over a year now and this is the first time its popped up. Its all Alexas in the house and its been a few days now.  I tried searching for an answer but most results are about notification noises and her being a different color. Its not that.  Any ideas?"
Some AmazonBasics quality control problems have been in the news recently including faulty USB cords that cause fires.  I haven't been able to find a list of affected products yet but was wondering if anyone knows if the AmazonBasics cords are the same as those used for Alexa products?  It would seem to make sense that they would use their own product for economy of scale sales benefits.    [https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/10/business/amazonbasics-electronics-fire-safety-invs/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/10/business/amazonbasics-electronics-fire-safety-invs/index.html)
"Hello guys. I’m new to this sub. I have the Fire tv cube and can’t change my language. I asked Alexa « speak Spanish » and she says If I want her to speak Spanish and English, I say yes, and she tells me I need the Amazon Alexa app to do it. It doesn’t work though. I go to the app, to the device, click languages, and boxy rows appear blank. When I scroll down, the only language that appears is Spanish. I click it and it says updating. It never updates. It even gives me an error and tells me I have no internet connection. The language options alors don’t appear in the preferences of Alexa settings on the cube. I tried the language switch on two devices, android and iOS on WiFi and on cellular. It doesn’t work! Any ideas? Please help? I’m super confused."
"Cannot use a Ring out of the box, as it would point at the neighbour door, and they’re not the easiest going folks to begin with.  Options are a peephole cam that works with Alexa, or taking a Ring apart and use the cam module in the peephole.  Anyone had a similar issue, and how did you work around it?"
"Hey So my grandma got a new Smart TV today, and im not able to go there right now and check it out. i just would like to know if an Echo  is always a requirement to use Alexa to control a Smart TV. or are there Smart tv's that have alexa integrated which you dont need an Echo for? Thank you :)"
"I can't recall exactly when,  but I've noticed within the past few months I've been unable to verbally set a location reminder (""Alexa, remind me when I get home to XXX."") without having to launch the Alexa App to finish/confirm. I get the feedback ""to finish setting the reminder, open the notification I sent to your phone"", regardless of the type of device I'm speaking to.  Anyone else have a similar issue, and is there a fix? I enjoyed \*not\* having to launch the phone app every time I wanted to get a location based reminder...  &amp;#x200B;  Specs: iPhone 8 running the latest iOS, up-to-date Amazon and Alexa apps, location services turned on/set to ""always"", latest software on Dots/Echo/Auto/Buds"
"It hears me for everything else; but when I try to answer it keeps repeating ""Sorry I didn't catch that"" and repeats the question.  I've had it for almost a year and this is a very recent development.  Any ideas?"
"Hello,   I am looking for a switch or button that can turn off or on all of the lights in the house and work with Alexa without the need of a hub.   I have seen a few smart switches but they either require a hub or to be wired to the light switch to work. I just a button / switch that when pressed, and does not require a connection to the phone as to work.   I am in the UK, so anything on [amazon.co.uk](https://amazon.co.uk) would be great."
"i have a bookshelf speaker, it is plugged in to my tv.. if i plug an echo input to the speaker, will i still be able to hear responses even while i'm watching tv?"
"Besides the basic one, I’m looking for one that almost would like, make me answer a question or something before I could turn it off. I’m a very lazy person in the mornings and tend to sleep until the very last minute and I’m looking to change that."
That is all.
I wish I could choose a bunch of apps and either delete or disable them all in one go. On the web interface you can delete multiple like this.   It would also be cool if the app and web had an option to “cleanup duplicates”.  That’s All.  Thanks!
"Anytime I ask if I store is open or what their hours are ""however, due to current health and safety measures hours may be different, do you want to call them?""  Half the time hours aren't correct when I compare to Google and the store.  The amount of times it mishears me its frustrating. Then it won't hear the wake word while it's talking and I have to yell.  Ask Alexa; what's the difference between Strawberry jam and strawberry preserves.  Smh  Even with brief mode on, I find Alexa is just too noisy for me.  I'm about ready to unplug all my devices."
I have five Alexas in my house and I prefer Spotify but everyone else uses amazon music. Can I change the default to Spotify on my echo without changing anyone else’s?
"I have thrown out all my WeMos and replaced with Gosunds. I also removed the WeMo skill, so there should be no more link between the Alexa app and the WeMo backend. Suddenly all the old WeMos devices are listed again in the device list. This tells me that one of two things must be happening: either the WeMo skill is still somehow active, and WeMos puts them back into the Alexa app, or Alexa stores the old devices in some internal cache and then suddenly brings them back.  How many times do I have to delete the old WeMos now? I don't mind doing it once more, but then how many times will that creep back in?"
"I don't own an Alexa, this is my boss's Alexa that serves as our store speaker. I've never had issues with her til last week when she started interrupting my Spotify playlists with Cardi B's new single WAP. She'll turn off my music to play that song, and continue to do so if I turn the song off. I guess someone else is connected to her, is there a way to find out?"
"I've only had my echo dot for a month or so. I noticed a nominal charge on my card from Amazon.    I dont use the echo for much but as I am WFH sometimes I say ""Alexa play X song, by Y artist."" Then I get back to work. It just occurred to me that they could be charging per song, per play.   I feel like a doofus because the artists have to get paid somehow and I'm not listening to ads.   Would it be better just to subscribe to Amazon Music?"
It feels so silly but I have an Xbox and 3 dots and have been waiting patiently for what feels like an eternity for the Xbox skill to be available in India but have had no luck. Does any one have an ETA or even a work around to get Alexa to control my Xbox?
"I can't for the life of me get Alexa to change Spotify accounts. I've disabled the skill, logged on as the different user and as soon as I tell it to play something, it goes right back to playing from my Spotify.   Is there some trick here?"
"As of yesterday ""Pause"", ""Resume"", and ""Stop"" work again on my Echo groups with Spotify. The commands stopped working a couple weeks ago. OTA hardware update perhaps? I'm a happy camper once more. :-)"
"I don't mean so much the ""what can it do"", more how do I get into the habit of using it?"
Hello everyone!  I have a game room and was wondering if my idea is possible.   I want to be able to turn on my RGB’s strip and computer at the same time by telling Alexa to. I have an Alexa plug and a Alexa device on that room but not sure how to set it up so that is possible.   Thanks
"We have a number of Alexa devices in our home. We've noticed that when my wife will command Alexa to do something, she doesn't respond. It's not even that the blue light turns on -- rather NOTHING happens. Like she didn't even speak.  Has anybody else experienced this?"
"My setup is fairly simple: 6 Echo Dots, 1 Echo Flex with motion Sensor, 8 controlled AC sockets &amp; lights, and now a gifted SmartThings hub with a water leak sensor and a door sensor.  I have managed to complicate it up by mixing this together with no brand-loyalty.  For instance, Wink hub with Lutron Caseta dimmers, Philips Hue Hub with 4 Hue lights, a couple of MQTT sockets (Sonoff/Tasmoto devices), and some unknown brand sockets (couldn't resist, 4 for $40 at Best Buy).  It all works, but it's a bit of a mess.  At a simple level, I'm happy.  And more important, my wife is happy.  Voice control of all our important lights, cooling fans, etc works reliably enough that she's happy with the money we've spent.  But now that I've added the water leak detector and the door sensor, and my Alexa setup sees them, I want to add two things at a minimum:  1. On the water leak detector saying ""I'm wet"", I want to send an announcement every few minutes until acknowledged. 2. On asking Alexa ""Is the garage door open?"", check the sensor and answer the question.  Ideally this would be ""smart"" enough to answer correctly depending on the sense of the questions...  e.g. ""Is door closed?"" vs. ""Is door open?"" should answer ""Yes"" or ""No"" as appropriate.  But where do I start?  Can this be done with an Alexa Skill?  I am aware of an use IFTTT for a few very simple non-Alexa &amp; non-home-automation.  Or how about this new (to me) ""Blueprints"" thingy.  I've dabbled with OpenHAB and am aware of Home Assistant.  I suspect either of these would work, but might be overkill?  I'm competent with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and even made a career out of BASIC &amp; Pascal programming, so I can learn.  Thanks for listening."
"Hi!  I am just wondering if there is anyways to create custom commands for alexa to control xbox? If there is no simple method, is there a way to create custom commands through IFTTT and github? Just looking for advice! Thank you!"
"I haven't opened my app in a while, but I found that almost every switch has a double and both seem to work.  My OCD is killing me, i just want one device so there's no chance alexa turns on or off the wrong device!  &amp;#x200B;  I can't find anything online- has this happened to anyone else?"
"I use Leviton wifi switches to control my fan. I found something interesting.  I cannot say something simple like ""**alexa turn the fan \[on|off\]**"" as it will reply with ""**A few things share the name 'fan'**"" but I can say '**alexa, turn the fan to \[low, medium, high, max\]**' without specifying the device name for the fan.  any news on when I'll be able to turn on the fan without having to say the name of the fan?"
"Follow up mode , dont seem to be working on this new cube.. Anyone else got it working ? ;("
she drones on when I have Apple Music selected as my default service.   I really shouldn't have to specify that when asking for a song...   Sometimes I wonder if she's worth keeping around.
"New user.... I am trying to configure Alexa to make an announcement to all 5 of my Dots ""Garage door is open"" using a ST Multi Purpose Sensor. I created a group and added all Dots. However, when I create the routine, it does not give me the option/show the new group created to play from. I have tested it with individual Dots, works fine. But I do not see the new group I created.  Any help would be great. Thanks so much."
"I have your typical bedtime routine with Alexa. She turns off all the lights, makes sure all the doors are locked, etc. Nothing out of the ordinary. But for some reason it will not turn the TV off as part of the routine.   The TV is connected to a Harmony Hub, the turn TV command on and off, puase/play, all work great. I deleted the Harmony Hub, the Harmony skill and put them all back in Alexa. The commands still work great, but for the bedtime routine, the TV will not turn off. What else can I try? Or is this a known issue?   Side note: When I setup the Harmony Hub, I had (2), one for upstairs and one for downstairs. But at the time, Alexa only worked with (1) hub, so I only setup (1) hub. Has this issue ever been fixed?   Thank you,"
"Any ways to set up a routine so Alexa can tell me when the next alarm is set for? For example, if I wanted to make a bedtime routine that turned off the lights and said “your alarm is set for 8am Tomorrow” OR “you don’t have any alarms set”. Is that possible? I’ve looked for a bit myself and can’t find any ways of making it happen, but that would be an excellent tool to have."
"Is there any way to configure my Echo to stop announcing the device it's connected to? Its annoying to have it announce 'Now Connected To [Device]' every time I open my laptop.  Yeah Alexa, I'm aware of what device I'm physically using right now. You don't have to tell me.  I've tried every setting in the Alexa app and lots of Googling, but without finding a solution."
"""Stop everything"", ""Pause everything"", and ""Resume everything"" now work for me with Spotify and paired speakers. Anyone else?"
"My Lincoln has an Alexa app.  I drove into a Mobile station, told Alexa to pay for gas.  The response was you can only do this on a mobile device like an Echo auto.  You would think a car was a mobile device.  It may be that it can't read from car's GPS, but I still find it odd."
Every morning I find that my Echo resets its volume to approximately 3. I reset it to five and then the next morning it’s again lowered to 3. I have tried completely resetting the device and re-adding it to my account and it still does this every single day. Gremlins?

"My ex-wife and I divorced, sold the house, and each have our own place now.  Our kids split time with each of us.  My ex has an Echo registered to her, and I bought an Echo Show registered to me.  We are still in an Amazon household together, sharing Prime benefits.    In my Alexa app, I can see her Echo, edit settings, etc.  I haven't asked yet, but I'm guessing she can see mine too.  Questions:  1.  When I announce to all devices, will it announce to hers too (same household, different account)?  2.  Is there a way for us to separate our devices but still share Prime benefits?  3.  If we do end up not being in the same Household anymore, would it be possible for her to still have the ability to call my Echo Show from her phone and video chat with the kids?  Would I just have to have her as a contact on my Show?  Thanks!"
so i'm in europe and i like to wake up a bit early to catch the nba playoffs. i usually time it around when i think the 3rd quarter will begin but that's just me guessing. is there any skill where i could make it so alexa wakes me up exactly when the 3rd quarter starts?
I have it working in my living room and had it in the bedroom until I upgraded to the new model for the remote.
"We have two people in our house that use alexa. Both me and my mother have full amazon accounts and we share an unlimited family plan under her account. This account is the same one that the Alexa's are under. We would like to set her up to recognise voices and respond from the appropriate account. Such as playing one person's playlist. However we cannot find an option to manage the household under settings. It appears that all the online walkthroughs are outdated, as they tell you to look in the top left corner for the ""more"" option, but it is in the bottom right for both of us. When I go to my amazon music account to cast music, it claims that i am not connected to any devices. How can i fix this issue so that she automatically switches between accounts based on which of us is speaking?"
She can't find the song on her own but if i say play the playlist with it in it she will play the song.  i have checked and i am using the same song name as i was before when it used to work fine.
Why is this still an issue?    &amp;#x200B;  Why does Amazon partner with Ecobee then limit the capabilities?
I’m looking for some smart led RGB light strips that work with Alexa and are 45-65 feet (in Canada). Any suggestions?
"Without issuing the wake word, Echo Show randomly said today “I don’t know that, but I do have a Skill you might be interested in called Deeznuts. Would you like to enable it?”. I asked Alexa what did you hear and she just repeated the phrase above. History doesn’t show anything triggered that. Also searching that skill shows it to be malicious so please don’t test it out because it sounds funny.  Any idea if someone has been able to hack these devices somehow by making them randomly recommend malicious skills?"

Hey all! Does anyone know if there's a way to send audio from a Mac to an Alexa speaker group?  I've been looking everywhere and can't seem to find anything that works. Your help would be VERY appreciated!!Thank you!
Anyway to make an iPhone shortcut to activate and alexa routine?
"So I’ve had my echo dot since last Christmas and it has been working perfectly until these last couple of weeks. 8/10 my echo will have a blue ring when I say Alexa as if its listening then when I ask it a question or tell is to turn something on for example it’ll just stay blue and not answer. And sometimes when I press the action button on the top in hopes that’ll work it just turns red and does the “Im sorry, Im having trouble understanding right now please try again later”. Fyi I am using the charger included with the echo so its not that. One possible theory I had was that it could be something to do with my new pc which I built and setup early August (which was when it started having problems. I thought either it was stealing the signal from it or something since they are pretty close together but I cant really change that as my room is quite small. And another theory is that my pc might be like using to much electricity and my echo isn’t getting much as its in the same extension cord. Idk if thats like possible but im pretty stumped atm.  Anyone else have any ideas and/or have experienced this before? Many thanks, Booglehoop :)"

"I got a couple of Amazon Echo Dot devices connected to my Apple music. It works well enough so long as my artists and songs are in English. I also listen to a bunch of Spanish, Finnish and Russian music and it is basically impossible for me to request that as no matter how I pronounce it, Alexa just doesn't get it.     What can be done so that the overall voice interface is English but I could say something to make it understand?"
"In a routine you can set an Ifttt action typically, and mine seem to not be working?  Anyone else having any trouble?  Maybe it’s just my services but I wanted to check on this semi-niche issue."
"Sorry if this is already answered, I searched but couldn't find it.  We are two people (A and B) living in the same house. We are both on the same Spotify family with separated accounts, and on the same Amazon household family with different accounts. Alexa is able to recognize our voices, and we are logged in on the Alexa app with our individual accounts.  When I ask Alexa who am I, it says you are A and you are in A's account. When the other person asks, it says you are B and you are in A's account.   When we ask Alexa to play music, it always says playing music on A's account no matter who asks. We would like Alexa to use the account of the person who is speaking (so if B is asking for music, it'll play on B's account). Also, only my phone (A) is able to play on the phone and stream it to Alexa. B's phone doesn't have this option.  &amp;#x200B;  Is this possible?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks everybody."

"So I am using my 3rd gen Echo Dot as a blue tooth speaker synced with my pc since the echo dot is plugged into my surround sound system via 3.5mm jack. Everytime I pause a youtube video while using the Echo Dot as my audio output it will unpause any videos I pause after about 4 seconds of having them paused. I know this is random but it only does it on youtube and I don't know why. When I use any other blue tooth speaker with my PC it never has this issue, its only the echo dot.

"I have an Echo and several dits throughout the house all set up in a multi-room system via the Alexa app. It works great and the sync between devices is amazing. A short while later, I bought a Onelink Safe and Sound. I thought at the time that any “Alexa built in” device could be added to the multi-room group. Wrong. I can’t get it to add, except maybe to a homelink group, but I dint have any other homelink devices. Is there any way to get this thing playing with my other Alexa devices?"
"I’ve noticed over the last week that my Echo would struggle to connect to my phone when I was trying to play music from Spotify, whether I tried to connect to the echo directly through Spotify’s devices list or by saying “Alexa, play Spotify”, but eventually it would connect and work as normal.   Well today this wasn’t the case as it just won’t connect at all, when I say “play Spotify, Alexa replies with “here’s Spotify” and then nothing happens. I’ve even tried playing the music directly through the Alexa app but even that doesn’t work as it seems to buffer without actually playing.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
"I have set a few music alarms with my alexa now, all linked to amazon music and I have checked on the app that they are the right song but when the alarm goes off it plays a random song. Usually of a similar genre but still pretty much random. Has anyone else experienced this? Any way of fixing it?"
"My son (2 years old) really likes music from a few artists, he's obviously too young to use voice controls but I like the idea of having a few buttons on the wall of his playroom that he can press to play music and I could put a picture above each one (eg a star that would play twinkle twinkle little star).  What is the best way to do this? I can see there are various smart buttons but I'm not sure which ones play nicely with an Amazon Echo."
"Hello, I recently purchased a Sony Bravia tv. One of my reasons I purchased this tv is because of its smart assistant support. My Alexa is setup and linked to the tv and usually works well. My question is, how do I get Alexa to not ask what device I want to open Netflix or any other app on? Whenever I say open Netflix it lists off my DVR, Fire tv, and smart TVs in other rooms."
Is what she’s telling me for routines that have worked for a long time. Multiple echo devices.  Anyone else?
"Does anyone using Alexa 2.2.356720.0 and Spotify 8.5.74.834 still have working voice commands ""Pause"", ""Resume"", and ""Stop"" for GROUPED Echos? Those commands stopped working for me a version or two ago. Hoped these new updates work fix things. Nope. :-(  Non-grouped Echos still work, but my Studio/Sub group and a pair of Echo Gen 2's no longer accept Spotify commands. Volume control works, I'm assuming because it's not a Spotify function. Contacted Amazon. Two hours with tech support confirmed that they don't have a clue beyond ungrouping speakers."
Is there a way to have different volumes for music and normal alexa? I find that the music volume is too loud if I set the volume of the alexa voice to where I want it.

If I tell Alexa to turn ON or OFF the Bedroom Light she also turns OFF the Television in the Living room (The same one the Sound bar is attached to.  I've found I can get around this by telling Alexa to DIM the lights to 0% or set them to 100%, in which case she does so and leaves the TV and Sound Bar alone.  My wife hates it when I go to bed early while she is still watching TV and forget and turn off the light"
"She starts playing music. Next song sucks. ""Alexa, skip song"". ""which song would you like"". Continues to play the shitty song. ""Alexa, skip song"". ""which song""?. FUCK! ""alexa, stop"". she keeps playing. ""ALEXA, STOP PLAYING MUSIC""!! she keeps playing...I repeated this a few more times and she wouldn't stop. ""ALexa, newsflash"". She starts giving me the news. News finishes and she continues shitty song. So I unplugged my studios. Go into another room. ""Alexa, play 90s punk"". She plays again but wont skip or stop until I unplug. This shit is getting so damn bad that I am to the point I am going to sell all my devices.  What a complete waste of money. Every year this shit just gets worse and worse and this sub just seems to be filled with nothing but bad experiences lately. What a joke. I can't even count on one hand anymore how many times I have reset all my devices, started from scratch and still crap like this everyday. Rant over, sorry! lol"
Might sound like a dumb question but just wanna make sure.
"My grandmother is in a rehab center for the next few months while she heals from a broken hip. My mom wants to put something in her room so we can keep any eye on her since they aren't allowing visitors right now.   In my state it's legal to put a camera in a room at a nursing home, but it must be different for rehab centers because when my mom asked, they said no. However, they did agree to would hook up an alexa or Google nest hub. I don't see how that's any different, but whatever.   Here's my problem with using an exho show. My grandma has really bad dementia and a lot of electronic things (and just life in general) confuses her and will even make her angry. If I get an echo to use for monitoring purposes, is there a way to keep the home screen as minimalistic as possible?   I know there's no way to turn off the ""try this"" nonsense (which will also confuse her), but is there a way to keep the screen turned off when it's not being used, other than someone telling alexa to turn it off? So like when we end the monitoring, will her screen turn back off by itself?   If not, I need to be sure that she sees nothing other than the clock and one wallpaper at all times. I don't want rotating pictures, news stories weather alerts, etc scrolling across her screen because she won't understand why it keeps changing.   Like I said, we only need this to keep and eye on her while she's in there. Along with the dementia, she's extremely hard of hearing, so this will be completely one-sided. There will be zero communication between her and whoever is accessing the GrannyCam.  Speaking of one-sided, when this is used as a monitor, can she see us back? Because that's not what we want either. I need this to be like a one way mirror.   My next issue is with the monitoring itself. Who can access it? Both of my parents and myself have echo shows, but they're all on separate Amazon accounts, so would we have to attach my grandma's echo to my mom's account in order for her to access the GrannyCam? Does that mean no one else in the family can access it or is there a way to grant my dad and I permission?   Does accessing the GrannyCam work like when you drop in on someone and it's going to ring on her end or will it just turn on the camera? I need it to not ring. If she's even able to hear it, she's not going to know (or remember) what to do to get the screen to turn on.  If that's not how you access the camera, then what do I need to do instead? Is it a skill I'd have to download?   If the Echo is not the device for this, what would be better? Keep in mind, they already said no to the camera.   Thanks in advance!"
Which out of the two above are generally better for just a general bedroom environment? Most likely not for heavy video conferencing. Anyone had nay experience with the 2?
"I have echo's in every room, and since I'm now working from home i put an echo show 5 on my desk.  Is there a way to get video or audio from my computer to the echo show?  Going to a youtube video from the show isn't the easiest.  Thanks"
"Two examples:  1. My kid has a wake up routine that plays a rooster sound, says good morning, and plays a specific song from Amazon Music (I sub to the service) on an Echo Show 5. The last two weeks there's a 50% chance the song will play. 2. I have a series of alarms that play from a 1st Gen Echo Show through the day; today they stopped going off. I had to manually turn them off and on in the app to get them to reappear.  Over the last few months I've noticed this kind of degradation in performance with Alexa as a whole across my many Echo devices, especially around routines and command recognition. Is there something I can do to make it better?"
"I got an Amazon Echo for Christmas 2018. For the past two years I have used it as an alarm set to a radio station through tunein. I set it with the command, ""Alexa, wake me up at [time] to [radio station]."" It has worked consistently for two years: the echo starts playing the radio station at the requested time, and will continue to play for an hour if I don't stop or snooze. As of last week this has changed: about 30 seconds after the radio station starts playing, a chime/alarm begins sounding (sort of a musical ""doodly-doodly-do, doodly-doodly-do""). Asking Alexa to ""stop"" turns off the chime but also the radio station. This has disrupted my morning routine and made me very confused and grumpy at the start of every day. I cannot find anything out the ordinary in the app: the scheduled alarm shows up with the right info IRT the time and radio station, no mention of a secondary alarm or sound. Could anyone please help or offer some advice?"
"So I have a globe led light strips and globe light bulbs they will all turn separate colours if I say red they turn red but if I say white only the bulbs turn white  I also have a geenie bulb and it will turn red but not white.   I disconnected everything in the alexa app and only added my globe strip lights and when I said lights white it said ""did you mean living room"" I said yes and they turned white. I added the bulbs I said lights red they all turned red I said lights white and asked if I ment living I said yes and only the bulbs turned white I disabled the bulbs and said it again to turn lights white and it said the device is disabled then i said living room white and the led strip turned white"
"So I just moved into a new house. I had the phillips hue lights at my old place, and had them hooked up to Alexa, and there were very few issues for years.   Well, after moving, I brought the hub and lights to the new place, and set them up. But since it's a new place, I used the lights in different areas, gave them new names, groups, etc. in both the Hue app and the Alexa app. So I deleted the old names, rooms, groups and all that and started fresh. Again, in both apps.   Everything was working fine, for about a day. Then tonight I tried to turn on the bedroom lights, and the echo said those lights were unresponsive. All others worked.   So I started troubleshooting, and one of the suggestions was to disable the skill in the Alexa app. So I did, and whenI reconnected my skill and discovered devices (lights) it not only showed my new light names and groups, but also all the old shit I had that's no longer active in either app.   And the bedroom still doesn't work with the Alexas or Alexa app. They DO work with the Hue app.   I've disabled the hue skill numerous times after deleting all the old names, and it still uploads the old names along with the new ones. I have 7 lights connected in this new house, but every time I re-enable the Hue skill, it ""discovers"" 20 devices, over half of which are no longer active.   Any ideas on what is going on?"
"I am planning on doing a shower time routine, and for that I want my alexa to play music as I enter the shower. What I thought would work was:  Turn on bathroom fan  Play Joe satriani iheartradio (no timer)  Wait 7 minutes  Say ""get out, you're clean"" (but nicer)  Wait 3 minutes  Stop radio  Wait 7 minutes  Turn off bathroom fan.   But that doesn't work. It never gets past playing the music and the rest of the functions don't follow. I did trick it with timers for the music activations but that stops the song and arbitrarily plays another one for 3 minutes. Also, I want to do a similar function where a bathroom heater turns on 2 minutes before the shower is over but that would involve stopping the music twice and that just doesn't fly.  Anyone know why the music functions don't continue the string, and more so how to fix that without putting the music itself on timers, thus forcing music resets?"
"So my girlfriend set up some Amazon Alexa devices for her dad as they lived together. They are on her account. When we setup Amazon Household for our accounts, all of the devices from her account show up on my Alexa app? How do I disable or remove these devices? It's showing as ""Wi-Fi Networks saved to Amazon"", but I've deleted my saved wifi networks through the website."
"So, I made a sunrise Routine for when I say, Alexa, start Sunrise, but want to add it to my morning routine. how do I do this?"
"so to put it shortly i have 2 houses rigged with hue lights, one house has well over couple dozen.  that out of the way, it worked fine on both houses, but now i have issue where in my room 3 gu10s  will get replaced with different light names in groups - checking app its clear its running auto discovery for new devices prob every day, so deleting renaming lights groups doesnt help.  i did try to make a group on diff amazon account of family member and its still same issue, i think somehow alexa cached original light names when first setup thus creating duplicates after they got renamed, as it doesnt make sense that it would pickup other lights on different account.  whats even more odd, that once light names get changed in group from ex-room 1-2-3 to hue spot 6, spot 2-3, i cant turn it on/off yet alexa gives that bling sound as if she does so ? that said if turning on with hue app or switch and then asking alexa to dimm the lights it does :/ ??  have read official amazon alexa forums but seems there is no fix for alexa dots/app running auto discovery, which basically ruins the groups replacing light names in them.  its and odd issue ive noticed about few months back, but aside doing hard reset on my alexa dots not sure even if it would solve it if its in the cloud saved, dunno what to do, as can create a group delete lights that dont exist and it works for a day and then defaults to whatever alexa discovers.  oddly enough only one room is affected by this."
"So I have a parent in the house with my significant other, in an attached in-law suite.  I'd like to set up Alexa in her room and allow it to control her lights, answer questions, chime when the ring doorbell gets hit, etc; but I don't want her to be able to say alexa read notifications and get ""one shipment arriving including trojan condoms"" or anything like that.  If she says Alexa turn on lights, I want it to only affect the lights in her suite.    My significant other is already my +1 adult in my household.  Parent has her own Amazon account (including Prime; holdover from before her husband died earlier this year).    Is there any way to set up the Alexas in her area to respond to her and do some stuff but not give her complete access?  Do I make her a teenager in Amazon's eyes?  If I do that what functionality do I give up?  What functionality do I gain?  Honestly it's really the Ring doorbell chiming that is the most important to me, and not giving her any access beyond that; everything else I can kind of live without but would be nice to have."
"I have a tapo smartplug, and I manage to add it to my Alexa. Through the app, touching the ""on"" button, I can turn it off or on, but when I tell Alexa to do so, she just answers that that device isn't responding. Routines just doesn't do anything to the device.   I've tried to disable/enable tapo skill, rename the device from tapo app, without luck.  It might be worth mentioning that I had my amazon devices profile configured to another country (europe) and I just change it to US (I want cool skills and features)."
"I created a routine to turn off the lights, tv, and Xbox, but my Ring system doesn't seem to be an option even though I have it connected to my Alexa app. It's listed under ""Smart Home All Devices"" but says ""Unsupported"".    Is there a way for it to set it to home and armed and ask me for my code within the routine? Or do I have to do that separately?"
If you go to Smart Home / Scenes you get a completely different list. Much shorter.  Where does the other list come from?  The problem is that many scenes are duplicated or even appear 3 times and some of the instances don't work.
"Does any one know of a skill that makes Alexa’s ring light up to sound. Me and my wife use the thunder storm sounds a lot to sleep, and I thought it would be neat if that skill could use the ring to simulate lightning. Ether but it flashing during the deep base of the thunder or from it being programmed to at curtain times. I also thing it would be neat if her ring moved when she talks kinda like KITT’s voice display did in Knight Rider.  Any one know of such thing or ways to make this happen?"
Looking for a way to stream YouTube Music to my Alexa devices and only seem to be able to do it via Bluetooth to a single device. Any way to stream it to all of them?
"My alexa is randomly talking, but only when i play music. She would say, ‘From (my name): llllllllllllllllllll or ‘rrrrrrrrr’. Just recently she said ‘I’m homelessssssssss’. It’s creepy af and idk what to do. It interrupts the songs all the time and I don’t know how to make it stop"
"So, I just got my Echo Dot, and have a LOT of CDs, and want to play them on my Dot, but I can't figure out if I can. Is it possible via 3rd party/official software? Thanks in advance!"
"So, I just got my Amazon Echo Dot, and am loving it! Now I need to turn my room into a smart room tho, haha. Tomorrow I am getting a smart bulb, but don't want to spend more than $40. I have a budget of about $65-$70, but can't really stomach spending nearly $100 on a single light bulb. Plus, I want to get some Bluetooth Speakers to spread around my room and have them connected to Alexa. What is the best dimmable, multi-color Smart Bulb for the dot? Thanks in advance!"
"Her answer, “Arizona.”   It was very unexpected."
"So recently i acquired another echo dot (2nd Gen) that was laying around unused at a family members house. I was stoked because i already knew exactly what i wanted to do with it. I put it under my gazebo's roof on my back deck. The main point of this was to blue tooth it to my speaker i have there and use it instead of streaming from my phone when Im out there.   Setting up the dot and connecting the speaker via blue tooth went without a hitch, however the volume was very low. streaming music from pandora, full volume on the dot and the stereo and you can barely hear it. I would say the volume is &lt;30% of what i get if i am streaming from a phone. I have searched for a solution to this problem and all i find is a bunch of people with the same/similar issue and no solution. Anyone got any ideas? Is this a problem with all the dots or just the 2nd gen?   This is a huge issue for me as i had plans of integrating better speakers into my setup all threw my house, now im worried  i wont get anywhere near enough volume to be the solution to my home audio desires."
"Wondered if anyone could help me with a situation.  So I have an Echo Dot in my lounge, and an Echo  in my bedroom. I also have hue lights in both.   If I say ‘Alexa goodnight’ to the lounge dot, I want it to turn the lounge lights off and leave the bedroom lights.   If I say ‘Alexa goodnight’ to the bedroom Echo, I want it to turn the bedroom lights off and leave the lounge lights.   Is that possible? Thanks in advance."
"I don't want to turn off notifications, just stop the yellow light from blinking."
"If I ask Alexa a question when I have a delivery notification waiting, without fail, she launches into a short lecture about how to ask her for my notifications. I find it irritating, because usually those notifications aren't for me, they're for another household member, so I don't want to clear them in the first place, nor do I need multiple reminders as to how to clear them."
"My Echo Studio can't perform gapless playback. Has anyone else experienced this? I used to have an Echo Plus in the bedroom. I have a track that plays ocean sounds that is about a minute and a half long that when played on a loop, blends perfectly. I replaced the Plus with a Studio hoping to beef up the sound but it can't loop. There's an audible gap when the track repeats. Weird that the Echo Plus can do it no problem but the Studio, which is supposed to be a high end speaker, can't.  This also occurs on albums like 'Dark Side of the Moon' or 'Sgt Pepper' where the songs are mixed to flow into each other. All my other Echo devices do it no problem but there's a good second of silence between tracks with the Studio. It kind of screws up the flow of the album you know?  What's really frustrating is, this is my second one. I thought the first one I bought was defective so I sent it back to Amazon and just set up the new one and lo and behold, same thing.  FYI I'm an Amazon Music subscriber and this issue occurs no matter how close I move the speaker to the router. Also, Amazon support doesn't know what gapless playback is so they're no help.  Any suggestions?"
There's any way to have a trigger to enable a powersocket when I'm outside home? (phone is not conected to local network or by using gps location?)  I have a security camera inside the house and I don't want it working when I'm at home
"I think maybe it was either an alarm or a reminder.   I use the timer function a lot and that sounds different.  This sounded flowery, melodic.  Something that seems like a morning alarm.   However, I never set an alarm.  If it was a reminder, it would say something, right?"
"I want Guard mode to set to Away and Home when I go to / get home from work.  I got 1 routine working when I go to work, but how do we change the Guard status to Home in a routine?"
"I had 2 routines that used to set the volume to either 5 or 10 then shuffled my pandora stations. About a week ago they broke and now just play pandora but not my stations.  The routines are the same and ive unlinked and relinked my pandora as well as checking my stations. But for some reason the routines are busted.   I set it to  ""Shuffle my stations"" on ""pandora"" under that action of Music and Media."
"Voice commands Pause, Resume, and Stop no longer with Spotify and any of my Echo groups (a Studio/Sub group and a Gen 2 group). They worked up until about 10 days ago. I posted here about it before; only one response. Anyone else? Amazon support wasn't helpful. Non-grouped Echos still work fine. Commands work with Amazon Music and the groups."
its like her volume breaks when i ask stuff but her voice is normal

"Hi all, my family has all been under the same roof, so we have only had to have one Amazon account with prime, and all the Alexa devices (Amazon Echo), Lutron Caseta dimmer switches, Logitech Harmony One remote hub, etc. sits in the same house with the same account.  My sibling and I have moved to two separate apartments, meaning we now have 3 separate locations to deal with:  Home   Apartment 1   Apartment 2  However, neither of these options seem to fit within what we want:  **A) Separate Amazon Accounts, 1 for Each Household**  The easiest thing to do would probably be to have 3 separate Amazon accounts, 1 for each location.  *Problem:* We want to avoid having to buy 3 Amazon Prime memberships. Plus, I like being able to tell Alexa ""reorder shampoo"" etc. and I know the rest of my family likes doing that as well.  **B) One Amazon Account, each room is setup as a new ""group"" in the Alexa app**  If we have 1 Amazon Prime account, we can setup each of the Echo devices in a new ""room"" group.  *Problem:* If we try to have a Lutron Caseta hub in each household, it becomes challenging because you can only have one account associated with any ""skill."" In other words, if our home and both apartments each have a lutron hub, we can't connect all 3 to the Alexa app because each hub is associated with its own Lutron account, but you can only login to 1 Lutron account in the Alexa app. Lutron requires 1 account per hub.  **C) Is there another option?**  ...Any ideas on how we could have 3 Amazon Alexa accounts so we can setup our Alexa skills independently...but still share Amazon prime?  Any advice is appreciated!"
"So I have one first gen Echo and two first gen dots.  On two of the three, I have switched the vocals to respond with a British accent (American here, but what can I say? I'm an anglophile).    I recently installed a Moen smart faucet.  The Echo in the kitchen (with a British accent) does not understand when I try to give the faucet commands.  One of the dots (no accent) elsewhere in the house does understand.  While I haven't experimented yet, could changing the accent alter the processing of commands?"
"I'm setting up a minimalist TV set up. I have alexa set as my bluetooth speaker for the fire stick TV, is there a way to control Alexa's volume with my fire tv stick remote?   Basically, I'd like to use my alexa as my primary speaker for this TV and it would be nice if I could control the volume with the remote.   Hope this is the right place to post, thanks."
"I gave Alexa an instruction which she misunderstood, and activated some ""time on video"" function. Now I have a time in the top right corner whenever video plays. How can I turn that off?"
I'm a bit confused. I have Spotify premium and Spotify is connected to my Alexa account and is installed and logged in on my computer. Why can't Alexa play music through it?
"Also, I turned the volume down manually and the next time it started playing music it was on full volume. In the morning when I plug it back in everything seems normal."
Amazon Echo Show (1st Generation) (Black or White)  $44.99  Sold on Electronics.Woot  Condition: Used - Good  Color: Black
I was wondering if anyone else used Alexa to read their Kindle book purchases.  I have the AutoEcho in my truck and have Alexa read books to me as I drive instead of listening to the radio.  She does have an issue with some words that can have multiple pronunciations.  Like Bow (Hair Bow) and Bow (The Bow of a ship) which can be a bit comical.  This also works with my Echo and Echo dots but I mainly use it while driving.  I have so far read 20 books of a 35 book series.  The kindle app also keeps track of where I am in the book so it starts back at the correct space whether I am using Alexa or just reading on a Kindle app.
Can i set skill timer? For example: Can i make Alexa open CNN or NPR everday at 7:00 AM?   Is there anyway to make alex activate this skill everday at 7:00 AM automatically?

When I send her a message it goes to my Dot as well, so I have a notification that I have a message to her from me. Is there a way that we can set this up so that messages for a person go to that specific device only?"
"My neighbours have an Alexa right against our joining wall and, despite being told how loud it is, play it at full volume when they're drunk.  I have an Echo near the same spot, if I used announcement on mine would their device acknowledge the wake word when I get it to say ""Alexa turn it down"". If anything just to interrupt their music.  Or do Alexa's not respond to the voice of another? when an Alexa advert comes on TV ours doesn't follow the command, so I wasn't sure."
"Just set up my new Alexa enabled Yamaha YAS-209 soundbar. I can play music to it on its own but when I try adding it to a multi-room music group, it doesn't appear.  The multi room music group consists of one group of echos, set up in stereo mode, labelled Kitchen. Strangely I can't select that group to play directly in Spotify, either. I have to tell Alexa to play spotify in the kitchen and even then, [the group doesn't appear as a selectable device.](https://imgur.com/a/itofuQX)  Does anyone know why these are happening?"
"""Alexa, Am I Gay or Straight?""  ""Hrmm, I'm not sure.""  *Sighs* ""That makes two of us."""
"I have an Echo Dot and a Sonos Beam in my living room and a Sonos One in my kitchen (next room along).  Previously when I’d ask Alexa something she would only reply from one speaker (usually the nearest), regardless of whether several speakers heard me or not.   Now (in the last 12 or so hours) she’s started replying from all speakers that hear the request at once.   The Echo Dot is actually set to respond via the Sonos Beam, so at the moment when I ask Alexa a question I get the Beam and the Kitchen speaker replying at roughly the same time (slightly out of sync with each other so it sounds horrible), followed by the Beam repeating the same reply again.  Any one else had this issue appear?"
"She told me the time and then said ""speaking of time, perhaps you should call someone to talk"" or some shit  I literally ask her what time it is a million times a day (for when I'm getting ready for work) or to know when I'm taking a medication, and because I will ask her what time and then immediately forget what she said because I don't actually focus on her answer and my brain is fucked up  I just found it extremely coincidental because today I cried at work and came home early and asked her what time it was and she said that. As if she knew I had a shit day. Even though I know it wąs just a random coincidence, never hearing it before.... Damn. Alexa wtf."
"So I have one dot in my room. I have all my smart lights connected to it, but I was wondering recently if it would be better to switch to google assistant, just for longevity and such since I see posts all the time about Alexa not working properly. So is it worth my time and money to switch to google assistant?"
"I am having problems with Alexa and IFTTT.  I'm using webhooks to send commands to my webserver downstairs.  I noticed it isn't working right anymore.  IFTTT requests that should be adding stuff to a database aren't happening.  I opened IFTTT, checked the log and the last activity on the applet was 5 days ago.  I edited the applet, copied the webhook URL and opened it in my browser and it worked fine.  So I thought perhaps the link between Alexa and IFTTT was at fault.  I figured I'd check the IFTTT skill to make sure it's still linked.  However, I cannot find IFTTT anywhere in my skills list.  Amazon didn't remove it, did they?  I can't imagine why they would, but I'm at a loss as to what to check next.  Thanks!"

I also tried variations on the spelling i.e. 'H D M I' or 'hdmi' or 'hdmi', none work"
"Hi, sorry just asking, I just got a new Alexa device for my bedroom, im just curious about it always listening and/or doing creepy stuff, is there anything to note or know or any advice on its privacy?"
"So, I have three devices: two dots and an echo.   They've been working great for about a year (the Echo is a bit newer). They'd listen pretty well and do what I ask in general.   For the last month, Alexa is basically hearing impaired. She can't understand me half the time, sits there thinking about stuff and then stops listening, or just does a completely different command.  She has said ""did you mean...?"" more in one week than all of the last year combined.   Furthermore, it seems like they updated her to think I'm always trying to make her play music. Me: ""Alexa, turn on the light.""  Her: ""Sure, playing country's top 100.""   Me: ""Alexa, when was George Washington born?""  Her: ""Sure, playing songs by Tchaikovsky.""   Apparently something similar is happening with my friend's Alexa.   Did they update her or something?"
"As I said in the title, I just now got three echo dots to try and keep up with my 3 kid’s virtual classes schedules. I’m just now starting with alexas so don’t know much... The app seems almost too basic, makes me wish it had more options, but maybe I’m using it wrong... Example: I had set up a reminder that one of my kids has a live meeting every weekday at 1:50 pm, but then I realized she doesn’t have the meetings on Wednesdays. Alexa doesn’t recognize the command “set a reminder for every weekday **except** Wednesdays, so I have to set **four** identical reminders for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.  Any way to maybe like check boxes for which days I want the reminders repeated? (My iPhone has this option for calendar events).  Is there a Skill (I think that’s what they’re called) that works with iCal or with Outlook calendar?"
"Ok, so this is hard to explain, but here's my issue.  I recently got an Alexa-enabled LED strip which has dynamic modes. You can only trigger static colors via a routine, but can activate modes through a direct voice command.  For example, I can say, ""Alexa, ask fairy light to run rainbow mode,"" but there is no way to do this as part of a routine.  Is there any way for me to basically have my Alexa trigger a preset command such as the one above in a routine? Looking for a skill or IFTTT method. Thanks!"
"I used to be able to say ""Alexa, play Rick and Morty"" and she would turn on the TV, open Hulu, and play Rick and Morty.

"I made a blueprint skill where Alexa can tell guests or cat sitters where everything is and how to do tasks around my home. I created it on my phone, obviously. But it only works on my phone. It doesn't work on my echo dot. So its essentially useless! I dont know what to do. Alexa keeps saying that the skill no longer exists but I can still access it from my phone."
"Has anyone else noticed a change in the way Alexa gives the 7-day weather forecast? It used to give a day-by-day forecast (e.g. Thursday will be sunny with a high of 89 and a low of 74. Friday will be partly cloudy with a high of 85 and a low of...), whereas now it's doing what my Google devices do and saying things like ""on Thursday and Friday it will be cloudy with stormy weather while Saturday will be rainy. Sunday and Monday will see some sun and thunderstorms. Daytime highs will be in the 80's with... etc""     I've had Echo Dots and Google Homes since launch and am now on the latest versions of each. I don't tend to use the Google devices for weather for this very reason - I don't want a roundup of several days grouped together, I want specific weather by the day. Has something changed across the board or is there a way of changing this in the settings that I've missed?"
I want to listen to Audiobooks and Podcasts at night without switching on my phone. Phone light at night is causing bad strain to my eye. I wish to use the audio command to play the Audios. How is it possible? Google is my default assistant but doesn't seem to support Audible I guess. How to switch on Audio command even when the phone is locked? My assistant doesn't reply when the phone is in a locked mode. Is Amazon Alexa a better assistant for a Mobile phone?
"Somewhat new to Alexa and I love the convenience of voice commands. However, my wife hasn’t embraced fully the concept mostly because she can’t remember the device names. So I created a couple of routines, first a room inventory. She can ask Alexa for a ROOM INVENTORY and hear what all the rooms are called. Second, once in a room she can ask for that room’s device inventory. For example Alexa, LIVING ROOM INVENTORY. Alexa then speaks each device name, if it is a light or a switch, turns it on, waits 5 seconds, turns it off and goes to the next. At the end of the routine Alexa gives instructions how my wife can do it. For example Alexa will say “to turn on Light1, say LIGHT ONE ON or LIGHT ONE OFF. After a couple of uses she has the device names down pat. This could be especially helpful for elders or the memory disabled."
"Can I say, ""Alexa, Im Home"" And have Alexa play a certain song?"
"I just upgraded my Echo Dot to a 3rd generation, however I can't get the volumes adjusted to acceptable levels. If I turn the alarm volume up to a level I can hear it, then the reminders are so ridiculously loud you can hear them outside. If I turn down the volume far enough that reminders to take my medicine don't wake up my damn neighbors, then I might as well have not bothered to set an alarm because I can't hear a single fucking thing.  Also why can't I easily transfer a single device Amazon music subscription to a new device without jumping through hoops? I'm ready to pack the thing up and ship it back and stick with the old one that can barely understand me."

"please note i am not a believer in ghosts and if i was i dont think theyd be able to communicate by alexa. thats why im pretty certain theres some trickery here.  basically, i believe someone i know is being pranked through an alexa to think her dorm is haunted. their alexa is connected to one of the roommates, but as far as we know, none of the others (a total of four.)   the alexa was acting odd already-playing music without any commands or apparent stimulation, randomly saying stuff. then, after playing a ghost app twice and discerning the ghost name as ""robert,"" on the same day the alexa randomly said M (owner of alexa) says: Robert  after that they held a like... q&amp;a with it where they wrote questions on a paper, crumpled it up, and the alexa answered in coherent one word responses in order of what they wrote. as far as i know, these did not include the ""M says..."" preface; it was just saying the words. no notification sound either. im wondering if any of you know what feature of the alexa could be used for this prank to comfort my friend and explain why shes likely being pranked by M and not actually experiencing a ghost. i dont think itd be anything too complex feature wise bc i did find a video where you can code it to say anything but i really dont think any of them would be able to do that, and its likely phone controlled. any ideas?"
"If im listening to something (such as a podcast) and I pause, when i come back after a few hours and ask to resume she starts the episode / track fro the beginning instead of where i was.  Anyone else has this problem and has a solution?  Thanks"
"I have 3 Alexa's. One in the living room (my 1st one), a echo show in the kitchen, and a echo Dot in my room. They all work great. Even though it doesn't happen a lot just every now and then, my echo Dot would reboot itself and I don't tell it to do it. Is that normal?"
Is there anyway to permanently stop Alexa from asking to learn my voice?  I have searched and can’t find anything about my this request. Thanks for any help.
"My husband and I are primary English speakers, but have spoken Spanish on and off since high school, and are OK at conversational Spanish. Yesterday, one of our Alexas informed us that they had a bilingual mode where it should automatically pick up which language you are using. We thought this would be an excellent way to practice our Spanish (especially with quarantine and not traveling), so we set our devices to English/Espanol (United States).   She absolutely will not pick up on the Spanish. My pronunciation is good, and we even tried having my desktop computer ""speak spanish"" commands just in case I was crazy about my pronunciation. I eventually got her to set an alarm in Spanish, but I could not get her to set a timer. Every time I have tried to speak to her today in Spanish, she gets confused or ""doesn't know that"".  What am I doing wrong? Is there some kind of trigger word that switches her from one language to the other? I tried starting a question with ""Hola, Alexa"", but that did not work."
"I have an Echo that I bought last April, and when I ask for ""my updates"" in the morning, it gives me headlines from ""Newsie"", but it's awfully quiet. I have to turn the device up several times to hear it, and then when it's over, Alexa is so loud, it's like ""THAT'S ALL YOUR UPDATES!"" as if she's the voice of god.  Anyone else have this issue??"
"is it possible?  I have saved quite a lot of music on my ""I like this song"" playlist, but every time I ask her to put some music she shuffles that playlist. I want to listen to NEW music based on my taste.  If I ask for new music she just gonna play the top hits of today :("
I was looking at the Alexa app on my phone and Im having a little trouble navigating the new UI so maybe I just cant find a setting but is there a way to make Alexa anounce the hour on the hour between certain times of the day like a cuckoo clock would or the way a digital watches beep every hour  I searched the skills but didnt see anything.
"I bought a 2019 Samsung TV 8 series a year ago and I recently bought an Alexa and I clearly remember it saying on the box it works with Alexa and Google. I connected alexa and it says it is not sure what I mean when I say ""Alexa go to channel 11"", ""Alexa turn up the volume""  or ""Alexa open up youtube"" , it only understands me when I say ""Alexa turn off/on the TV"". Do I need to set up specific skills? I would think alexa would already know some of these basic skills especially changing volume and channel"
"So I bought an Echo last week, I like it. Mainly to play music in the background. I cancelled my cable and along with it, lost the streaming music channels. I noticed though that there is a shit-ton of repetition from a very small playlist on all the genres I selected with ""Alexa, play jazz"" or whatever I pick. It's like 30 songs over and over again. I have Amazon Premium, so is there something else I have to pay for to expand this playlist?"
"I have 4 dots and a Plus with a couple different speaker groups set up. Doesn’t matter if we’re controlling from our phones but playing on alexa, or asking her to play music, she no longer know she’s playing music. Anyone else??  And yes, my gen 3 dots have been acting up for months, while the Plus and gen 1 dot are rock solid. Ugh."
"Hey everyone,  I have Alexa in my bedroom, bathroom, and living room. I have multiple ceiling and lamp light fixtures connected to Alexa. For more than a year I've been able to say commands like ""Alexa, brighten all the lights of 100%"" or ""Alexa, turn off all the lights"" or ""Alexa, brighten living room lights to 50%""  But now something must've happened and when asked to brighten all the lights to 100% Alexa responds by saying ""I don't know how to set all lights to that setting""  Any advice on how to fix this? I suspect I need to rename some of my room arrangements, but I'm not sure what exactly is the problem"
"I have 5 Alexa pods.  All in different rooms of the house, each with their own name.  I have the app as well and can control then all at any time.  Recently, I can be in room A, tell Alexa to play a song and it plays in room B.  This is happening with 3 of the pods.  I have not added or taken away any pods recently, nothing has changed with location.  Any idea why this is happening with 3 of my pods?    This only happens with verbal commands.  If using my phone app and i tell Room A to play, it plays in room A.    Help!?!?!?"
"Yay, all of my routines based off of SmartThings virtual sensors are now working again.  I had to create new ones, but just glad they work.  If anyone was having trouble with this I’d recommend remaking the routine.  Best of luck!"
"Hi, i have a roblem where on one account i have made a public playlist so that my friend can also play it but their Alexa cannot find the playlist. They have a Sonos system with Alexa built in so that might have something to do with it. Help appreciated."
"Ultimately, I would like variations of the voice command for a routine. As I can’t do that the alternative is to create multiple routines each with its own voice command. What would be great is to create the one routine and then the variations to call it.  Not only would it make things quicker to set up but also be easier if the routine needs to be changed."
"trying to watch imdb video and amazon keeps playing commercials with the alexa wakeup word in them,  ""alexa play alecia keys"" and the fucking echos start playing fucking alecia keys while I'm trying to watch a movie and will not shut off.   bite me amazon,  you suck.   why would you do something so awful and annoying."
Hi. Someone in my home has some how set up scheduled announcements that pop in around the same time everyday. Does anyone know how to turn these off? Thank you
I wished I could say Alexa then clap my hands twice and have the smart plug turn on the lights for me. Or without saying alexa and clapping my hands would be cooler.
"Normally it just plays the next one in the queue. Unplugged Alexa, didn't fix it. Anyone else know how to fix this?"
"Every day Alexa tells me the weather normally. As expected. Until today, when she mispronounced my towns name.   Why is she suddenly saying it wrong when every other day she’s said it right?!   I enabled the pronunciations skill and asked her to pronounce it, and she did correctly, but when asking the weather she is now saying it wrong.   How do I fix this?"
"Soni went to the blue prints and created a skill. Im a magician so i wabted alexa to help me perform a magic trick (baiscally spectator chooses a card and alexa responds it was the 8 of clubs)  Anyhow, it seems the opening phrase start magic trick is already in use by her basic stuff, so then i renamed it card trick.. that too dosent work...  So then i gave it the most random name Alexa, open ""abracadabra bogus""  And now she says, i cant help you with that one. Yet to make sure i ask her what she heard and she repeats exactly right. So what the hell?"
"For example something like: ""Alexa, turn off desk lamp in 5 minutes?""  I've tried all sorts of utterances, but I could never get it to combine a timer with an action (such as turning on/off a plug)."
It won’t let me play Spotify through my Alexa how I usually do (through the Spotify app). Is anyone else having this issue and is there a fix?
"I pay for Spotify.  When I try to listen to Spotify in my car via Apple Carplay and someone is at home listening to Spotify on whatever device, I interrupt them with whatever I’m listening to. When they change it back, it switches mine off.   In fact it says on the screen in the car that I’m listening via one of the Alexa devices at home.  Is there a way to stop this?  I thought it might have been the Alexa auto screwing things up. But I switched off bluetooth and it still caused a problem.  Please help me.  TIA."
Have you ever had Alexa play a few seconds of music randomly that you did not ask for and then just stop? Scared me half to death and I can't even be exactly sure which one did it (have three in close enough proximity). Has anyone else had this happen?
"With Google Home or Siri, you can ask something, get a response, and then ask it to repeat that response. However, try the same thing with Alexa and you’ll get...  “Sorry, there’s nothing to repeat” or “You don’t have any notifications.”  This is *beyond* aggravating. Is there no command for Alexa to simply just repeat the last thing she said? Like, if I ask a question and Alexa answers it, why is Alexa incapable of repeating that same answer back to me upon request? I’m sick and tired of having to ask the same question just to have Alexa repeat her previous response. Seems like a “could you say that again?” command would be basic functionality, no?"
"Is there any way to trigger a routine in Alexa based off more than one person's location?  For example, Life 360 has a trigger in Ifttt that is triggered once all members of the Life 360 circle leave.  Right now it seems that Alexa location triggers for routines are only able to be based off of one device.  Up until a week ago I was using SmartThings Virtual Sensors to trigger routines based off of Life 360 as a trigger in Ifttt but the new SmartThings app is broken for triggering routines, so that option is out the window at the moment.  Thank you for any insight!"
I heard somewhere that it couldn’t.
"I swear I saw a commercial yesterday for an alexa enabled pop socket, but I don't see anything on Amazon or Google. Was I dreaming? Lol"
"After 6 months of bliss where I asked the time and Alexa just responded with... well, THE TIME, it seems they've reintroduced the irritating greeting wishing you have a lovely day.  Holy crap, there has to be a way to undo this?!"
"I ask for Alexa to play one of my playlists, called “dog days.” It does manage to find the correct playlist, but then instead of playing it, it creates a station based on the playlist. Any idea why this is / if it’s an Alexa or a Spotify issue?"
"I've already posted on the Spotify group, but I'm wondering if anyone else suddenly had all Spotify commands stop working with their Echo speakers? I use ""pause"" and ""resume"" mostly, but they no longer work. The problem started with the Spotify update 8.5.72.800. Non-Spotify related commands seem fine. Problem exists on two paired and two individual Echos."
"I'm interested in getting an Echo Dot in my home. My parents both have one and I've found it to be super useful when I'm visiting them, setting timers and reminders and such.   My only issue is I don't know how much I trust Amazon. Having a big microphone streaming what I say to who knows where is somewhat concerning, especially with a large corporation like Amazon on the other side  Is there anything I should know about Echo that could put these worries to rest? (For example, how does it ONLY listen for a wake word?)  Admittedly, I'm not super well-versed in how it works. If anyone has any answers, please let me know! Thank you!"
"I registered an Echo at my second home under my Amazon account, while the Echo at home is registered under wife’s Amazon account. Since we are both on the same Amazon Household, I didn’t think that would create too much issue. When you mostly voice-control Echo, what does it matter whose account the Echo is registered under.  Except that the devices my wife’s Alexa has discovered are not available on my Alexa app. So when we are traveling, I can’t control the home automation devices from my iPad. I have to borrow my wife’s iPad and use her Alexa app to control them.  Is this a correct statement of the current state of things? People on the same “Amazon Household” account do not have access to the home automation devices the other person has registered?  So much for the “household” concept, then."
"Hopefully I explain this in a good way...   I want to ask alexa how many days its been since an event occurred. We'll use sports for example: ""hey alexa, how many days has it been since Team A defeated Team B?'.  I'm hoping alexa can reply with ""its been XXX days (maybe hours and minutes too, but not needed) since Team A defeated Team B.""  Does anybody know if something like that is possible??"
I have a routine where Alexa announces something to all my devices except echo dot kids' edition. How can I set up the routine for this device too? What am I missing?
"She almost always responds with ""I don't know that"" Is it my weird American-Aussie Accent, or is my Alexa just brain dead? I use an Echo Dot 3rd Gen BTW."
I’m looking for some inexpensive Bluetooth speaker(s) that can connect to an echo dot. Any ideas?
" Is it the skill or alexa that is having an off day?  The only answer it accepted as correct was the first one  I even checked the Alexa App to see what it thought I said and it has the exact answer that I said marked as ""wrong""  I tried multiple times (replay from 1st clue), reset the Echo Dot, etc...

"When logging into my Amazon Alexa account, it says ""Enter one time password sent to your authenticator app"" and I have no idea what an authenticator app is."
"Have I caught your attention with this headline?  What I strongly disagree with is that when I use that uttering, she doesn't shut up. If I just use ""shut up"", she does. But with ""fuck"" and ""bitch"" she doesn't.  Shouldn't it be \*my\* prerogative what verbiage I use in my home? Have the feminists advanced so far as to be able to dictate my verbiage at home?  AWS peeps, Alexa peeps, Echo peeps, I \*strongly \* disapprove of this. I know you want to be ""woke"" at AWS and Amazon, you like to pussify to all sorts of women, but it's not \*your\* prerogative to tell \*me\* how to yell at women. Eventually, my \*intention\* is clear: end the conversation, be that music or cooking recipes, or reading from wikipedia, there is \*no end\* to her babbling like a \*real\* woman in the house.  I know how to stop Alexa from non-stop babbling in a civil manner, ""shut up"" works just fine. That doesn't mean that with ""fuck"" and ""bitch"" you have the right to disregard my intention. You're not here to discipline me. ""Shut the fuck up, bitch"" should end the current conversation, no matter what you think about women's rights. It ends all conversations in \*this\* house, and your beloved feminism doesn't change this.  I think this is a conceptual error. As soon as the \*intention\* to end the conversation is clear (no matter how uncivil the language), it should end the conversation. Alexa shouldn't always think she should behave like a \*real\* woman (endless babbling, no end in sight ...)."
"Hi,  have a yeelight setup and everything is perfect. But recently I bought two yeelight on Amazon, and after configuration I cant see them on Alexa, they show as scenes ?? even as scene I cant control them, I created two scenes on Yeelight "" light on"" and "" light off"" to use them on Alexa, but it's boring everytime to say "" activate light on"" and so on when the others are working perfectly...  Did I miss something ?"
"I know this might be a picky thing, but it seriously annoys me so much when Alexa does the “By the way...” thing. I think it’s mostly because I usually just want a quick answer without having to wait for Alexa to say her whole spiel about how much she can do for me as an assistant. It’s happened to me twice today: once when turning on the lights and another when I asked her for the weather. It bugs me so much and I wish there was an option to disable it."

Hello. With e-learning I was hoping to set recurring alarms that Alexa calls out. For example I would like at 8:55am each weekday an alarm to sound accompanied by Alexa’s voice saying “time for math”. Is this possible? TYIA.
"Ok, I installed a Raspberry pie on my garage door, added the skill and made a routine that opens the door perfectly.  But, I'd like to add some qualifying conditions and don't see them. Anyone have suggestions for short/simple qualifiers that will prevent the door from operating when I'm away?"
I tried finding it on the forums but I was unsuccessful.
"You know how you set up routines on your phone, and you choose a device where it'll run said routine? Like my echo show will play my flash briefings a little after my alarm is dismissed.   Well, I've just added this skill to wake my PC from sleep when my alarm is dismissed (doesn't work with the PC actually shut down) and I found out that Alexa is able to be installed on Windows 10.   I want the Alexa app on my PC (turns on automatically when PC wakes up) to play my flash briefings after an alarm is dismissed. Buuuut when I make the routine on my phone, I can't find the ""Alexa App for PC"" as a device. It's in the actual devices list in the app, but oddly it's missing from the device list in the routine when I'm making it ""Alexa will Respond from"". Is there a fix, a workaround??"
"Hello, I am trying to allow my girlfriend to use Spotify on her iPhone (her own Spotify account) to play music on my Echo dots as well as utilize the Surround Sound music group. I did some Googling and it says to go to settings and select ""Amazon Household"" but that option is not there for me. Any ideas?"
"Here we are years later yet Prime Music with Alexa is still so bad that it makes paying for Music Unlimited a mistake.    Here I am sitting in my house on wifi, playing music from Prime on my iPhone to my Lounge group of Dots.   It will play for a couple minutes, break up, then die.    When I ask Alexa to continue playing the same album I’m told that it’s only available via Music Unlimited.  A moment ago I was playing this via my bog standard prime music.   This is not uncommon.    Then about a minute later it starts playing again.     Who is actually relying on this shitshow to play music?  It’s really weak ass.  God.   Is there a drive at Amazon to make us all buy vinyl again? Probably."

" Please find here under the description of the issue I have with the incorrect behavior of the app Mymedia for Alexa used in an Amazon Echo 8 configured with a default Sonos system: Description here under is based on an Echo 8 with my Sonos Port but is also valid with any of my Sonos equipments ( I have a PLAYBAR + bass + 2 Sonos 1, a Sonos 5, and a Sonos 3)  First of all a quick sum up of my configuration: I use the last version of mymedia inside a docker of my Synology NAS The version is currently 1.3.133.0 All my music is also in the NAS and except a very few exceptions uses the m4a format I have a Amazon echo 8 configured to use a SONOS PORT as the default speaker system.  I also have a Amazon Firestick 4 K configured to use the HDMI in pasthrough toward the TV set linked to a SONOS PLAYBAR via optical.  Both systems Echo/Port and Firestick/TV/PLAYBAR don’t work  “Don’t work” means that when I ask to play an album, I have the first track only of the album, the picture of the album only a few seconds on the screen then picture goes away .  Please note that even long time after I can say “Alexa suivant” ( means Next) and it plays the next ones. So it seems some process is hung.  On the contrary when I use Alexa with the IPhone ( alone), IPad (alone) or the embedded Alexa of my OLED LG TV ( linked through optical cable to the SONOS PLAYBAR, it works “It works” means that I have the picture of the album during all the time and system changes itself track to next tracks as it should work. Please note that some times it plays 2 times the same first track of the album then stops.  I have a contact with the develop team of mymedia for Alexa and their analysis thanks to traces I sent them is that this issue is on the Sonos side that obviously requests inconsistent to play several times the same track. I cannot understand all their explanations but they asked me that they should be very happy to enter in contact with your team for fixing that issue . Finally please not that Mymedia for Alexa is a very interesting program to use with Alexa as in France Amazon does not provide neither the Plex support or the Audio station skill Thank you very much Philippe"
"Me: Alexa, set a reminder to go shopping in one hour  Me: Alexa, check reminders  Alexa: Okay, reminder to go shopping at [time] CANCELLED!!!  Seriously, how can this device not even get the most basic tasks right? Asked my friend to test and has the same issue. 2016 this **** was launched - pull your finger out Amazon."
"Anyone else getting this? I used to use ""Alexa, skip song"" to... well, skip songs. Now she just asks me what'd like to play next. ""next song"" gets the same question."
So I own an Amazon fire and I just downloaded the Amazon app for my Android phone.  And I am surprised that the interface is better on my phone then on my Amazon Fire tablet.  It's easier to use its more customizable. No power brush. Amazon isn't trying to push me an ad every minute..  However much Amazon is making from selling these Fire tablet. I wish they would look exactly like their phone applications and have an option to use the exact same settings
"Ever since I got my studio synced with fire cube many months ago, I've had issues with the sound going out of sync with the video.   I'm not talking about lip-syncing which would be &lt; 1 second off, I'm talking 3 - 5 MINUTES.   I have not seen others complain about this.  scenario 1:  Often (like many times a day), I start a tv program, it plays fine for a short while, then the video freezes but the sound continues to play (ha! happened again as I type this right now for the 5th time this evening.)  I have to back out to the menu, then select to resume the program again.  scenario 2:  Often (many times a day), I start a tv program, it plays fine for a short while, then the video freezes for a second but the sound continues to play - then the video takes off at about 2x the speed and the audio continues to play at normal speed.   Sometimes it goes on for five minutes before I notice if I'm reading Reddit :).   If I press pause, the video pauses, but the sound continues to play for several minutes until it catches up to the point that the video paused.   Then I can press play and it will be fine - for a while, then the same thing happens again.  Am I the only one with this problem?"
"Hi. Is there some sort of parental control mode that I can switch off? Alexa will not translate ""penis"" to other languages."
"Like many millions of parents, my child will be attending school virtually from home for several weeks at least.  I'd like to have Alexa alert us what subjects to do when.  Something like, it's 7:45, time for home room,"" ""it's 9:00 time for science,"" etc.  It would be fun to get her to play a school bell during the alerts.  I have an echo dot and am pretty unskilled with routines.  Thanks in advance!"
I have two fire cubes one in the bedroom and one in the living room.   Periodically my two networks suddenly get the same name . I have no idea what causes that. But it totally messes up my fire cubes and they don't work.  How can I reset my fire cubes and make them work again?
I'd like Alexa to use specific DNS. How can I do that?
"Hi all,  I've just got Echo Buds and have tried them for the first time. As far as I know setup has gone fine.   I've tried putting the buds in my ears and double tapping one to enable pass through and/or noise reduction, but there seems to be no activation cue or other way to know it's worked. How do I know it's been successful, other than trying to go to somewhere noisy to find out?  Bonus question: if noise reduction and pass through mode are both (by default) activated by a double tap on either bud... how does that work? Or is it effectively that double tapping just toggles between the two modes, and no ""middle ground normal"" mode exists in between them?  Thank you for helping me clarify this."
"I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why the volume keeps changing in the middle of a track, or from one song to the next. I know there's a way to set playback to one volume on Amazon music, but I don't think that translates to echo devices, and frankly, it's really irritating when you're trying to put the kid down to bed and Pink Floyd is super quiet but Jack Johnson is screaming at the top of his lungs and the device is at vol. level 2 for both tracks, one after the other... Any ideas?"

"Hi all!  I've created a shower routine so when I tell her that I'm having a shower, she turns on the exhaust fan and lights. Is it possible to make it so that when I tell her I'm having a shower, she also asks me if I want any music played, where I could then respond by telling her what music to play? I have done some searching and so far it looks like this can't be done, but I've only started playing around more with Alexa so maybe it is possible and I just haven't done across it yet.  Keen to hear people's thoughts!  Thanks in advance!"
Hey guys. I was wondering if anybody found a nintendo switch skill to turn it on and off. I know there was an unofficial one but never downloaded it and now its not available. Cheers for any help!
"No karma whoring, likes, subscribes, whatever. I'd like to give my Alexa to someone who could use it. I imagine that seniors have an easier time summoning an Alexa than turning on a radio, or figuring out how to use their phones for live listening.  If you, or someone you know can use an an Alexa, I'll ship it to you. I'll pay for the shipping. If I can make someone feel less lonely during everything that's going on, I feel like I've succeeded.  Send me a PM, I'll send it this week.  Thanks reddit :)"
"I want to tell Alexa ""turn on the living room lights, except the table lamp."" Is there any way to do that?"
Similar to how Siri only responds to your own “hey Siri”?
I have a Galaxy a6 and it worked with my phone before and I have Bluetooth turned on I couldn't connect to my device I'm on the same wifi as it and won't connect if anyone has any idea why please let me know and yes I did restart both devices
Hi guys I’m curious if anyone knows the answer to this. How is it that when the Alexa commercial is playing my echo does not respond but when someone on say a YouTube video says the word “Alexa “ she will activate and do what they say?   I’m curious if anyone knows the actual answer not just a guess?   Have a great day!
"I want Alexa to be always listening without having to say ""Alexa"" everytime. I want to come home and just say ""turn the lights in the kitchen on"" ""turn the TV on"".  Is it possible to mod Alexa like this or a skill maybe?"

"None of the online instructions work, and Alexa tells me “I don’t know that” if I tell her to “block explicit songs”. I’m losing my mind with this and can’t believe that feature doesn’t exist here.   For reference, and have a 3,5, and 7 year old that love Alexa and getting her to play songs. Occasionally she’ll misunderstand and come up with some of the most filthy songs imaginable."
I am new to the app and I can’t figure out how to set an alarm on one Alexa but not the other and other things like that.
"I’m helping someone set up a smart home. He had a new LG 65nano85una tv. We have Alexa responding to commands, but if we tell her to change to a particular channel (MSNBC for example) she can’t. Google assistant, also built in, goes to NBC now on LGs own streaming thing. We have a cable box but were hoping to just stream everything.   I know the appleTV I have at home can search and go to content across different streaming platforms. Surely Alexa can do that too, right?  Currently, she can turn the TV off but not on."
Was already having a crappy sleep bc kiddo was in bed with me. I was going to throw it across the room but unplugged instead.  What gives?
"I cannot get alexa to correctly recognize all of the hue bulbs I currently have.  For example, two bulbs in my son's room will not show up.  I disabled the alexa hue skill, then re-enabled.  I looked online at alexa.amazon.com, it seems to show the two bulbs.  However in the iOS app they won't show at all.    Also in my bedroom, 2 bulbs out of 4 are not showing in the app.  However if I say ""alexa set the lights to blue"", all 4 go blue.  I have a lot of smart devices accumulated past 10(?) years and it is really messy in the alexa device list because smartThings duplicates some of the hue bulbs and the massive list of hue scenes that I don't even use.  I have also moved and renamed bulbs over the years and I still stumble across bulb names that I know have not been that way for couple years.  Is there any way to force reset all the hue devices inside alexa?"
That's my question! I have a new firestick with Alexa. I am in the U.K. (if that matters). I saw on first startup a little drop-down that said 'free to me' (I am on Prime Student).  Then I never saw it again. I have seen photos of the home page with thea word 'free'. But it's not on mine????
i just want to turn this off as its annoying whenever i go to play a song 2 seconds in it gets interrupted by that and i just hate it so does anyone know any way of turning it off?
"Can you guys help me with my decision?  I'm looking for something to keep by my bed to use as a clock and an alarm, with a good music service, and something that can answer questions for me. The one thing I won't use with it is smarthome.  Which one do you think fits me best?"
Why does Alexa only show 11 songs in my Apple Music Playlist? I have tried the “go to the last song and skip” method and that seems to temporarily fix the issue.  Any help would be appreciated thanks
"So here is the base issue: I have different smart lights. My bulbs are one brand and my led strip another.  For their hue to match, I have to set different colours. For instance if I set them all to cyan, some are more blue and some are more green.  I know Alexa has a large set of available colours to choose from when Im just yelling at her to set a colour, but I was unable to set a routine using those more detailed colour choices.  Is this possible?"
"I have two Amazon Alexa devices but I'm mostly a Google Home user.  I use Alexa for a skill that GH doesn't have.  In the past I could use Alexa to send a text.  Tried earlier today and was told she could send a message to anyone in my contacts that have signed up for ""Alexa Messaging"".  Why was texting  to anyone in my contacts replaced by everyone in my contacts having to have ""Alexa Messaging"" ?"
"Hello!  &amp;#x200B;  I am a Portuguese university student, currently working on my Master's thesis dissertation. As part of my dissertation, I had to create a natural language interaction for an existing autonomous agent framework, and I used the Alexa Skills Kit to do that.  &amp;#x200B;  For the past months I have worked on and developed this skill that allows you to communicate with the Virtual Suspect agent framework, which is an autonomous agent that inhabits the role of a suspect in the context of a police interrogation. Now I am looking for people to test the skill, so I can get some feedback and finish my dissertation. If this sounds interesting to you, or you would just like to help me out, here's what I need you to do:  &amp;#x200B;  1) Before you open the skill, please read this document containing information about the case that you need to know in order to interrogate the Virtual Suspect, as well as some guidelines on how to interact with him: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJacn3LzyqZIMrFGVvU\_h4kRa62bkk8tYrMbe89nRzs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJacn3LzyqZIMrFGVvU_h4kRa62bkk8tYrMbe89nRzs/edit?usp=sharing)  &amp;#x200B;  2) Enable the Virtual Suspect Demo skill, which can be found at: [https://www.amazon.com/IST\_Palhas-Virtual-Suspect-Demo/dp/B08FZMVS7H/](https://www.amazon.com/IST_Palhas-Virtual-Suspect-Demo/dp/B08FZMVS7H/)  2a) You can open the skill by saying ""Alexa open Virtual Suspect"" and then you'll be placed in a dialogue with the agent and you can ask him questions about the case directly. There is no endpoint, you can ask him whatever questions you want and finish whenever you want, the session will be maintained until you decide to end the interaction.  &amp;#x200B;  3) After you finish your conversation with Peter, please answer this questionnaire about your experience, it should take no more than 5 minutes to fill and no personal information is recorded: [https://forms.gle/egR3WnViZapWPEiS8](https://forms.gle/egR3WnViZapWPEiS8)  &amp;#x200B;  If you do decide to try out my skill, please bear in mind that this is merely a prototype created for academic purposes and is not intended to be a fully realized game.  If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask!  You don't even need to leave a 5-star review or anything like that, just trying out my skill and answering the questionnaire will help me a lot!  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you for reading, and I hope that everyone is staying safe out there!"
"So potentially a dumb question but figure someone here will know. I have an Echo plus 2nd gen, a while back I ditched my Hue hub and linked all my lights directly to the echo. The Hue hub had been causing a lot of bother.   Now so far the echo works pretty well but on the rare occasion my internet goes down I’ve noticed you can’t access it via the app, it’s voice commands only. It was something I could do with the hue hub and it was hand on those rare internet outage occasions. I’m wondering is there a way to access the hub settings of the echo via my phone when the internet’s down or is it strictly via voice?"
"Howdy,     I ended up making my first skill 'Server name suggester':   [https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08FZJDCYD](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08FZJDCYD)      It's super basic and probably not that useful but it was fun and quite easy to make. I have a few good skill ideas that would actually be useful like a decent Birthday reminder that auto syncs with my Calendar (that is already synced to my FB contacts) etc which I'll explore later.     Yeah, just wanted to share! :D   Also can anybody please check if they can actually access/use this skill? I'm not sure if only I can see it because I'm using the developer account."
"My son (10) keeps turning his closet light on via Alexa and leaving it on at night disrupting his sleep. We are at a loss short of removing the bulbs from the closet light to get him to stop. I am hoping there’s a way to set a routine between certain hours so that when he tries to turn on the closet light, she either refuses or turns it back off. Anyone have any ideas on what I could do? Thanks!"
"I noticed on my echo show 8 that in my wallpaper options, I now have this ""daily memories"" feature that apparently shuffles through my photos from Amazon and displays them in random order on my home screen. I like the feature because up until now it always showed my photos in chronological order which got a little boring.  I'm just curious to know if anyone knows how it works and how it chooses photos to work. I can't find much info online other than how to enable it. As far as I can tell, it chooses photos from all of the albums I have rather than just one. It would be nice to just shuffle photos randomly from a specific album... But I guess that would be asking too much."
"I am trying to access Alexa Privacy under the settings of the android app on my Samsung S8 and I keep getting a No Network Available error, even though I have great signal, wifi and everything else seems to work - aside from blueprints which has the same problem.   It looks like that option, and the blueprints option, are trying to load an external web page. When I check the app permissions in the Android settings everything is enabled."
"For example.  In the same room. Alexa announces ""Alexa show frontdoor camera"".. will it work?     Of course, now i have to figure out a way to get Alexa to say that out loud."
"The Arlo skill is enabled. I can see the camera if i ask ""Show FRONT DOOR"" and it works and shows up on my Echo Show.  It will announce movement if detected on the Echo Show.  I just can't get it to show VIDEO on Echo Show when motion is detected.  I get half way through making the routine.. but the there is no option for showing on screen under ADD ACTION.  If i click ADD ACTION, and then SMART HOME. The only options are ALL DEVICES, LIGHTS, CONTROL GROUP, CONTROL SCENE.... there is no CONTROL DEVICE.  What am i doing wrong?  I deleted and reinstalled the app already. Signed out and back in."
"Hey everyone!  The 3rd newsletter is up and ready to go. This week I've got some cool commands related to kid stories, MLB highlights and election coverage, and Ringo Star.

Now it's a bit simpler. Hopefully its easier to get to the good stuff. Let me know what you think."
"So I have my wyze skill setup, and I love being able to say , ""Alexa, view 2"" and having the feed from that camera displayed on my screen.   Unfortunately, after somewhere around 10 minutes, it goes back to clock display. Is there anyway I can stop it from going back automatically, and staying on the feed indefinitely?"
"I just connected my smartlights to alexa and now they have been rendered useless. Alexa doesn't want to use them and my magic home app ( app that controls my smart lights) is saying that they are offline, the remote is also not working now. They are in a working outlet (checked it 5 times). I know the internet is working but i now have no conrtol of my lights and they have been rendered useless and I'm at my wits end, any advice?"
"Is it possible to set a default for a group of light's settings?   Like, if I tell Alexa to turn on ""living room"", it's always te same color and intensity as opposed to watever it was last set to?"
"I have Kogan Smart Home lightbulbs in my house, and then work great with Alexa. I can't figure out how to use voice to set up the disco sequence where the lights rotate through all colors constantly. Anyone done this?"
"The screen on my Spot goes blank/black for about 2 seconds, but only when I walk by. Any idea what triggers this?"
"I have three echos, on Spotify they show up as well as the google home nest minis. For anything else, only the echos will not show up. I’ve tried removing power, deregistering, restarting the WiFi. All the accounts are linked for the music services as well. I can’t for the life figure out why they won’t show up in apps for IHeartRadio, xm radio, and pandora."
How do I get Alexa to stop telling me everytime an artist releases something. When I tell her to stop notifying me she says to go to the Amazon Alexa app but there is nothing I can find to stop being notified of new releases

When asking to play a radio station or to request an app it suddenly can’t find it.
"2 Sonos One speakers in stereo.  I’ve connected the appropriate speakers, the AM skill, the Sonos skill, and both accounts have Apple Music activated and set as primary music source.  I’ve renamed the speakers so they don’t conflict with a room name.  Alexa, play MY “Chill Out” playlist - results in a station being selected with a comparable name.  No mixing of the command words seems to help."
"I know that you can view activity in the Alexa app but this doesn’t seem to show commands that Alexa didn’t understand.  I have a frustrating problem with Alexa intermittently not understanding basic commands. For example I have a fan that supports on/off or low/medium/high. So for example, I’ll say Alexa, set the fan to high.  About 60% of the time this works fine, but increasingly Alexa is responding with “I don’t know how to set fan to that setting”. I’d love to find out what she thinks I’m saying or what is going wrong. Annoyingly, most of the time I’ll repeat literally the same thing right away and she will seemingly understand it?"
"Is there a way to schedule an Echo to restart?   Every few weeks, my Echo's will stop working (I have 5).  Not all at the same time.  Usually it's just one of them, while the others are fine.  Currently, I unplug the misbehaving Echo, wait a few moments and plug it back in.  What I would like is the ability to have them reboot themselves at night, once every couple of weeks.  Does anyone know how to do this?"
Ask your Echo this and you’ll be treated to a little ditty including Alexa rapping to the best of its abilities. My 3yo discovered this Easter egg.
"Hey all, I'm trying to set up an Echo Dot for my grandparents, they have their own Amazon accounts and I'm trying to find the Alexa household option in the app, but it isn't there.  Did they remove it? All the guides I read showed the option in settings."
"Well, I mean my title is pretty self explanatory. I have searched all over .and could not find an answer. Is there a way to stop my Echo Dot, and Echo from controlling my firecube. It started to control the F iou firecube seemingly out of nowhere. Any help is appreciated!"
"Me: ""Alexa, play \[literally any artist or genre\]""  Alexa: ""Now playing x from Spotify""  Me: ""Alexa, play  Lianne La Havas ""  Alexa: ""Now playing Lianne La Havas from Spotify""  BUT it doesnt play Lianne! It always plays the last artist that was playing. Has anyone seen this happen before?"

Music groups are completely messed and no one from Amazon can help.  Seemed to start a few days ago.  Such a lousy company.  I bought 5 Echo Dots and they are useless.
"The Alexa “start my day” routine (quote, weather, news podcast) always works on my Sonos one  But it always starts with “audio actions in routines are currently not supported on this device”  So it seems supported. But I get that line **all the time**.   Any idea how to workaround?"
Is anyone using the eufy cams (indoor/outdoor)/smart doorbell/smart lock/sensors? I'm kind of leaning towards these now since I dont like what I'm reading about the wyze products. I wanted to bite the bullet on the wyze stuff but reading to much and info overload. I wanna kind of keep them all in one ecosystem if possible. I'm the eufy sensors can be used like the wyze say to turn on the lights in the kitchen at night when someone walks in. If my nest hello would only send instant alerts to my phone along with the google hub.....aww well gonna try out alexa. Thanks for any input...

"Has anyone solved an issue of their smart plugs keep disconnecting? I’ve had them all set up for 2 years no issues, then yesterday they both just started disconnecting. I reconnect them and within 10 minutes they’re both saying device unresponsive.   One is an Amazon own brand plug and one is a TP-Link. There is still an internet connection as Alexa is still working and it can’t be a WiFi issue as one of the plugs is less than a metre from the router and Alexa. Please help!"
"I have a dozen echos in my house.   Recently, one that has worked fine for a year has recently developed a strange issue.   It completes whatever task I ask of it, wether it be to turn on lights, start a timer or add something to the shopping list - then immediately following the confirmation ding (brief mode) it says that annoying “I am having trouble understanding right now...”   I have tried rebooting it and even factoring resetting it with no luck.       Anyone have this issue before?"
"or has anyone else noticed that it's harder for Alexa to hear you when you call her name? This started couple of months ago. Normally, Alexa hears me and responds even when I am saying something else that even sounds remotely like Alexa. It still does this when watching TV and a character says something equally similar. However, now, when listening to news or events that have commercials, Alexa doesn't hear me at all unless I'm standing right next to her and yelling her name. I can stand 10 feet away and yell it five times and she won't hear it. I notice that this always and only happens during commercials, when I want to say ""Alexa, skip."" Did Amazon make Alexa harder to hear so that people can't easily skip commercials? If not, any suggestions on getting Alexa to hear me better?"
"I can't get over the $8 per month cost for a game. I would rather never play song quiz again than pay almost $100 per year.   So people who actually pay for Song Quiz... Is it worth it? Does it remember songs you've already heard? Does it recognize female voices better?  Basically, what made you subscribe and is it worth it?"
"I noticed this recently, where I used to be able to ask, ""what time is sunrise?"" and Alexa would tell me what time it was in my home location. Now if I ask it, it tells me the time in Washington, DC and it says if I want a specific location, I have to ask for that location in my query. Has anyone else noticed this or am I missing something?"
"I have one of the bigger, first gen echos, but the thing has just become absolute garbage as time goes by, it takes 10 seconds or more to respond to every command, it frequently loses wifi, and it misunderstands far more than any other echo in the house.   It's become so frustrating I no longer care about the sound quality benefit and just want a functioning echo, so I'm switching back to one of my cheaper dots. I created a lot of routines with it and alarms with it though, is there an easy way to migrate all that stuff to ab different echo or is this something I must do manually?"
"So I have a Fire Stick hooked up to my livingroom TV which has a Sonos Beam hooked up via HDMI Arc. I also have an Echo Show in the kitchen and Dots in various rooms around the house.   I’m trying to play multi-room music on all devices but I just cannot for the life of me figure out how to get the soundbar to play the music at the same time as the Echos. I can only do one or the other.   When setting up the groups, it won’t show the specific Sonos soundbar available to add. It only shows the living room TV which is the fire stick. But even then it won’t play on the fire stick."
I thought about this after I saw some 'smart' lights that were compatible with Alexa and other apps and wondered if she might have a guard dog mode.
"Not sure if this is common knowledge but those requests were getting very annoying.  She should say ""Ok, I will stop asking you rate purchases."""
"I can’t find this information online for some reason, not even on Amazon’s own website, but which has the more powerful speakers between the Echo Dot 3rd Gen and the Echo Show 5?  Same question between the Echo Dot 3rd Gen and the Echo Show 8. Thanks!"

" Don't  want to reinvent the wheel while a lot of you experts have smart ideas  of how to do this.  I have Alexa, google home and smartthings hub at  home, but recently start using Iphone Xs.  Installed the Meross MSG100  garage opener last night and it works well with Alexa and its own native  app (for sending notification of garage status).  What  I want to achieve is to geofencing the garage opener, but need it to be  smaller than the minimum 492ft Alexa has for geofencing.  I have a long  driveway leading to a garage in the back, so ideally I should be able  to use ""phone connected to home wifi"" as a trigger to at least open the  garage.  Only thing I don't want it to happen is while I'm out walking  with my phone, the garage opens and closes when I'm connecting to home  wifi (i have set up mesh wifi, so the coverage of my wifi is pretty  big).  At mininum, I'd like to be able to use Siri to open/close the  garage (in IOS, it looks like I have to open the alexa app in order to  voice control, so that's an extra step)  I've  read some posts about geofencing using IFTTT or SimpleCommand with  Alexa.  Not sure if there are applets/scripts out there that I can  simply use.  Thanks in advance."
"Hi good people, I am having issues with the Amazon fire tv cube and was wondering if you could help at all? The issues are that the cube keeps losing wifi. The cube will start to flash an Amber line across the top of the box this will notify me off a signal issue.

"I have a routine that basically tells me ""Good morning, the time is, the date is, the weather is.."" etc as my alarm clock, when I run it on my phone as a test it pulls up the weather to display. Apparently I can get this running on the Show as well. Just wondering if the show is a half decent device?

"Hey all!  Back again with another am I dumb, or is this a missing feature I tought would be a very basic thing type of question.  Sooo; I'd like my good night routine, whichever currently ramps down the lights to 0 in 10 minutes and turns off my TV and finally tines down my living room Echo dot to volume 1, to turn down the volume of my 2 new recently installed echo flex.  Consecvently I'd like my good morning routine, which sets the volume to 6 and tells the weather and the news to set the volume of all the girls to 6 too.  Is this obvious and I just can't find it or is it really a not routine-able command?  I know I can tell Alexa to set the volume of every echo to x, but it really can't be part of a routines?"
"Fairly new to Alexa and been using it to set named songs as my morning alarm, but would rather just create a playlist of suitable songs and use that.  But if I say to use a playlist I've created in Amazon Music it never gets it right.   When a playlist called 'Wake Up' didn't work (got 'Wake Up To The Beatles'), I renamed it to 'Playlist 1' and Alexa chose 'The Best of One Direction' for my alarm.  Asking Alexa to just Play the playlist works fine. Am I expecting too much of it?"
"We are a family that likes to play games, do puzzles, etc.  We don't watch much TV.  We enjoy having ambient music around the room, as opposed to one or two loud speakers blaring.  We don't want to spend hundreds (or thousands) of dollars on any sort of surround sound system.  Similar to walking into a coffee shop and hearing soft music coming from everywhere.  Our game room is quite large, and I'd prefer to have 3-4 small speakers sitting around on bookshelves or counters.  We have an Echo Dot that we use for lights, or A/C, and a couple other things.  We'd like to use it to play music on these 3-4 speakers (one of them can be the Echo Dot).  I guess I could just buy 3 of the Echo Dots and sync them, but is that the best way?    We don't care about sound quality... not really, anyway.  The Echo Flex is too tinny (we need a little bass).  Volume never goes above about 20% on any device.  We like the convenience of talking to Alexa for music... we do that all the time and prefer it to any other method of finding music.  Any suggestions?"

Hey I'm pretty new to Alexas and I have a echo and I wanna make a routine. I have my lights and my tv connected and with the routine I can set up my lights to turn on and colour and stuff and to turn my tv on but I want it to also launch the YouTube app on my tv which I can do with my alexa through asking it directly but there doesn't seem to be a routine option for that. Is there a ''skill thing'' I can enable to have my alexa act as if I've actually spoke to it to launch a app or is there another way to make this possible. Thanks in advance and I hope I'm not just being stupid
It can't just be me.  Yesterday for example. The outside temperature here in the shade was 28'C  The BBC had it as 28. The Met Office had it as 28. Various weather services from Yahoo to Weatherunderground had it between 27 and 31.  My Echo Show reckoned it was 21.  I checked my postcode was right again and again. I've rebooted it numerous times.  Its constantly miles out. So much so that you might as well remove it from the homescreen as its complete fiction.  Is this just me?  A UK thing? or same for everyone ?
"Hey guys,  Ive got 4g home broadband. Earlier I changed my Ghz on my router to 2.4 to connect my PS4 to the WiFi. This restarted my router and when it was done, my echo dot wouldnt connect.  I go on the app and all it says in a red bar is 'failed to connect to network'. I have a Huawei B535 router and both 2.4 and 5ghz are enabled at this time.  The amazon support have been as much help as a chocolate frying pan for 2 hours, they mentioned channels but wouldnt explain what they are  Could someone please help me before alexa becomes my next garden frisbee?  Thanks!"
"For example: If I'm listening in my kitchen and walk to my bedroom, I'd like it to stop in the kitchen and simultaneously resume in my bedroom."
"My phone alarm app (Alarmy) has a feature called ""wake up check"". I'd like to suggest that this be added to Alexa.  Essentially this acts as a secondary alarm that goes off x minutes after you dismiss your alarm, just to make sure you're awake. Users can already do something similar by simply creating two alarms, but this is a more elegant solution."
"My wife and I are having a baby and the doctors office will be sending the blood test results to me so I can do a gender reveal for my wife. I made video reveal with my son and posted it on YouTube. I’d like to set up a routine triggered by an echo button press. Ideally the press will change all of our house bulbs to either pink or blue and will trigger the video we made to play on the echo show in the kitchen. The lights are easy, but I am having trouble triggering the video to play. Any thoughts on getting it to work?"
"None of the Alexas in my house work. I have 3 in 3 different rooms, and every time I try to command one, it will tell me that it cannot connect to the internet. My wifi is working fine, so what do I do?"
"My sister dad and I were talking about some random sign he had and in the middle of it our echo dot 2 lit green with the notification sound. now the echo is signed into my mom’s Amazon account and not mine so it only gets notifications and calls from her phone. So I said “oh the echo has a notification or someone has dropped in, ‘echo read notification.’ And then the hang up sound played and the green ring disappeared which means someone had in fact dropped into the echo. I called my mom and she said she was working so she hasn’t been on her phone until i called. Now is that normal? What should we do? I’ve already muted the mic. And I have to wait til my mom gets home to disable drop in on that echo."
"I'm trying to setup my new TV (LG 75SM8670AUA  [https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-75SM8670AUA-4k-uhd-tv](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-75SM8670AUA-4k-uhd-tv) with WebOS 4.6) to connect to my Alexa devices, I have 3 echo dot's through the house.  I am able to launch the Alexa app on the TV and log in just fine.  I've also created and logged into LG ThinQ app and can control the TV when it is powered on through the app.  However, I am unable to control the TV through Alexa despite the advertising of this TV as Alexa compatible and not sure what the problem is.    After logging into Alexa through the app on TV, the TV is added to my account and is shown in my list of devices as 'XXXX's webOS TV' (per attached picture) in the Alexa app on my iPhone.  However, I am unable to control the TV through my echo dot even though the device is listed.  Alexa tells me she can't find ""TV"", ""webOS TV"", ""XXXX's webOS TV"", ""LG TV"", etc.  In the TV's Alexa app, when I try to ""Add you Alexa device"" it says it's unable to find any other Alexa devices.  Everything is on the same WIFI network also.  I then tried adding the LG ThinQ basic skill, and after logging into my LG account, the skill says my account is linked but when it searches for devices, my TV is not showing up to add.  I suspect this is because it was already added through the Alexa app on the TV?  Has anyone else encountered this issue and know of a reliable solution?  I've tried de-registering the TV and just adding the skill, not logging into the TV's Alexa app and no luck as well."
"I'm sure I can't be the only distance learning parent trying to nail down the schedule for my kiddo's home schooling right now. I'm pretty new to using my Alexa echo dot and the skills, so I guess I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions? I've tried to go the routines route, but it doesn't seem to let me set up by time (past the start time of the particular routine). My kiddo has 3 separate schedules that change throughout the week. I want to be able to have our echo dot tell us when school starts, when it's break, lunch, etc. Do I just set up 20 separate alarms? Or is there an easier way?"
"I'm sure there is an easy way to do this (or at least to be told that it is not possible).  &amp;#x200B;  When setting a reminder on Alexa, I'd like there to be a persistent reminder in the light ring (similar to the way a notification has a persistent yellow light until dismissed). Reminders are great - right up until the point where I'm not in the room at the appointed hour. At that point, Alexa has reminded an empty room and I've forgotten what I wanted to be reminded of :)  &amp;#x200B;  Is it possible to set Alexa to have visual reminder that must be dismissed?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!"
"Just wondering if there's a way to control Bluetooth TV boxes, I used to have an IR TV Box and controlled it with a Broadlink device, but now I have a new TV Box that seems to have a bluetooth only remote kinda like a Fire TV, is there any way Alexa can control this device at all?  Thanks"
"Whenever I ask Alexa to play music by WAAX or Skegss, I presume because of the odd names. It'll instead play a song with a similar title. Is there any way to get around this?"
"I have an Echo Dot &amp; was wanting to find out if there is a discrete motion detection device that I could connect to it without it being visible on the home WiFi. I’m in a living situation with privacy concerns &amp; I do not want to install a camera or anything, as I feel like that would be inappropriate to have in someone else’s home, but I want to find a way to be notified if anyone enters my area. Is this possible?"
"I bought a 3 pack of Alexa dots - 3rd gen, so they were all the same.  Yet one has a distinctly different voice.  I have all of them hooked up to smart light bulbs in the house through a phone app and the Akexa app, it works great,. I can control my lights by voice which I love.  I just say, for example ""bedroom light on""  However that one Alexa with the different voice if I say that phrase to her, see he almost always responds with ""there are several different lights you can turn on using your home app, would you like to know more about your home app?"". I say ""no"". Then she says ""ok, what light would you like to turn on"" I say ""bedroom light"" and she turns it on.  None of the other Alexas have this problem."
"I have started having music playing problems, starting around the time of the pandemic, I have 3 Alexas, everything worked great between them but now they often will just stop playing music for no reason.  My internet connection is fast and solid, so that's not an issue,   Or they will do nothing after a music request requiring me to repeat my music requests even though they understand everything I say even when mumbling.     Also I used to be able to just say ""play my music everywhere"" which would play on all the Alexas, and she would respond with ""ok, playing on the everywhere group."" But now I have to specify ""play on the everywhere group"" or she won't play everywhere.  I find it odd that changed for no reason."
"I have and love my alexa echo spot but lately, I have noticed that the clock font is red rather than white during the day. I have nighttime mode enabled and that works correctly where at 9pm, the background goes black with a red font, but this issue happens during the day with the normal Blackground still intact but just a red font....... Any ideas?"
I have Alexa and a Fire TV. And most of the time I lose the tv remote. And I want to yell Alexa to lower or raise the tv volume. But every time I try she says “TV doest support that” can someone tell me the command please. Please And Thank You
It will just start talking about something and noone even came close to saying Alexa. It's gotten worse over the past year. Is there a setting for this?  Thanks

I recently got one of the smart plugs on sale and i have it configured as a light, and there's a quick-and-easy on/off button in the alexa app, so i can control it without saying a word. However, unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any quick settings or home screen widget thing I can do from the native alexa app.  So what I want to know, is if there's a third-party app to do this?

"Hey all I am trying to help out my brother in law develop an Alexa routine and I am not having much luck and figured I could try and pick your brains. He wants to use the Alexa button to trigger a song and flash his Philip hue lights. More specifically, when the Las Vegas golden Knights score he wants the room to light up with their colors and play this [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zheGI316WXg) file. He found some one online that said that they wrote a node script that ran on a raspberry pie. The script simply listens for the USB device to trigger and than tells Alexa to flash the lights and play the sound. But alas pies and node scripting are a little beyond my current education. I was wondering if any of you know an easier way to do this or could direct me to some reading so I can learn how to get Alexa to do what I want her to do."
"Greetings,  I'm thinking of getting Alexa and I'm interested in getting the Echo Dot 3 with the display, but with so many devices out there I wonder, is there any difference in what Alexa can do or is it the same for all?

"Here's a new post talking about the Alexa App Update with Wake Word Detection.

Alexa can't replace Siri or Google Assistant on the phone, sadly."
"So I’ve connected 2 different echo’s on my amazon Alexa app, but I want to remove 1 of them. I de-registered it and I say “Alexa, play the 1975” and it comes up with ‘playing the 1975 from DearBankManager Spotify’.  How do I remove it completely from that one device?"
"So I have multi room set up in 3 rooms, and when I'm listening to music or podcasts I have  them playing on the 'everywhere' group so I can move about the house doing stuff while listening. It's worked fine for months until about 3 weeks ago when alexa started playing up.  Sometimes, only one of the speakers would play, other times nothing would come out but when I looked at Spotify on my phone, it was showing the music as playing. I have reset my router, reset all of my alexas and reinstalled the app in my phone but its still playing up. It especially seems to hate shuffle mode. I have managed to get it playing on the group as it should, but as soon as I turn on shuffle mode and then say 'Alexa, next song', she just straight up dies on me.  I've run out of ideas, has anybody had any such issues?  Thanks in advance!"

"Hey guys!  I want to use mu Broadlink RM to control my TV using my voice. The thing is, its really annoying having to say volume down 5 times, so i made a routine doing volume down multiple times. The thing is i have to add a wait time, otherwise, it will register only one volume down, and the minimum time is 5 sec, so it’s annoying having to wait that time. I have the issue navigating (up, down, left, right) What can i do?"
"I remember scrolling past an ad on Instagram a long time ago for a device, I can’t recall the name, but it blocks the microphone on Alexa until you want to give her a command, so she is not constantly listening. Does this sound familiar to anyone?   If anyone also has any suggestions on other products or methods to protect privacy with Alexa I would really appreciate it. I love using it, but it creeps me out to no end that my household is being recorded constantly.   Thank you!"
"This has been an on-going issue that has only gotten worse. I have four Echoes* throughout my house. At one point in time, I was able to stream music from Spotify to all four devices simultaneously. Now, I can only play on one device at a time. I have re-created the Group, re-named the group, power-cycled the Echoes, everything short of hard-resetting the devices.   Anyone else have this experience and maybe a solution? Thanks!  *for reference, one 3rd gen Echo dot, one 2nd gen Echo dot, an Echo Spot, and an Echo input."
"I’ve tried every pronunciation and everything from Victory Clog to Notre Dame marching band.  The bitch will not play the song, even though I own it and have Amazon Music.

"I have a few PlusMinus Lumiman color-changing WiFi lightbulbs which, in addition to color, support white from 2700K to 6500K. I have them linked to my Alexa via the PluMinus Skill, and they work great for color changing: e.g.  Alexa, set nightstand to turquoise, etc.  How can I set it to white and then change the color temperature to 2700K?  I've tried the obvious:  Alexa, set nightstand to ""warm white"" or set nightstand to ""color temperature 2700""    but that doesn't work.  Any clues?"
"Bought my nearly blind father a Firestick for Christmas. The voice control of everything is a huge help for him. We hooked it up, he could ask for programs by voice and change to satellite to throw on channels he likes. From the day of hook up until yesterday he would just ask Alexa to “ Switch to HDM2/HDMI3” for input changes. This stopped working yesterday. Nothing has changed with our internet or TV since it was hooked up. I have searched for solutions and messed with setting and nothing will get her to change the input.  Any thoughts on fixing this for my dad?"

"I'm using hubitat, Smarthings motion sensors with Alexa Routines. All my Routines work to initiate when motion is detected however if I create a routine to turn something off if motion isn't detected for over an hour or more it doesn't trigger.

"The other night, I was chilling in bed when I heard a female voice coming from my Alexa.  I know it wasn’t the voice of Alexa though, it was definitely human.  She just said one sentence, and I think it was “Is he still there?”  I’m not 100% certain that’s what it was, as the memory is a bit fuzzy, but I’m pretty sure.  Right after she talked, there was nothing but silence.  I’ve never hallucinated before, and I don’t do drugs or alcohol.  I heard it clearly, as my Alexa sits on my nightstand.  I don’t know if Alexas are capable of accidentally intercepting calls accidentally? If anyone knows anything on this, please comment or message me with info.  Thanks."
"My family has kind of gone crazy with echos. Almost every room and both cars.  I got the fitting kit for the ring, but my index finger won’t fit even XL. I was leaning out of getting one. So:  1.

"I have two dots, two echos, two studios, and a fire TV pushing sound through my TV’s sound bar.  The dots sounds terrible when using one, but surprisingly good when paired in stereo.  The echoes are OK when using one, still better when paired in stereo.  Had one studio to begin with that sounded incredible on its own. Added a second studio to pair in stereo and it’s not as amazing as I had hoped. Although the sound is separated by channel, each one sounds about 50% weaker so the total volume output is still the same as I would get from a single studio.  Then, there’s the fire TV. When that is playing music by itself, the volume and sound from my TV sound bar is great.  I like to have music playing throughout the house, so I started adding my speakers to multi room groups. Whenever I play on a group, the volume and quality of sound coming through the fire TV/sound bar is horrendously bad. It is in the same group as the studios, which sound the same as when they are paired as stereo.  I also have a single dot pushing sound out through an aux cable/external speaker. If I’m just playing music to that, it sounds fine. As soon as I add it to a group, the sound quality is garbage.  Does Alexa not broadcast the full throughput of of audio signal to every device in a multi room group? Is it splitting left and right channels? Is the problem that I should not be mixing stereo pairs and single speakers in the same group?  I had to go all in on either Amazon or Google speakers, and I feel like I may have bet on the wrong horse."
"I have an echo connected to the fire tv 4K using Alexa home theater feature, everything works fine until the last update, now if I add the echo to a group as a default speaker it won’t play music, when you request to play music in Spotify Alexa says “playing X on Spotify” but nothing happens, if I remove it from the group it works, but it’s important the group to have room awareness, any ideas ?"

"I have a lot of WeMo plugs, and for the past month or so Alexa now is sometimes asking ""to better understand your device, is it connected to a light?"".  Some of my WeMos are, some are not.

"My Amazon Tap makes a sound every Saturday morning around 8 AM give or take an hour. The sound is the same one that happens when you place it on the charging base. It does not happen exactly at 8 AM .. sometimes a little after 7 AM, sometimes as late as 8:25 AM.  * There are no announcement, alarms, notifications, timers, or reminders. * It says nothing .. just the sound. * There are no routines to do this. * There is nothing in Activity on the app to explain it. * There is no vibration or anything that would cause it to rock in its cradle. * No power fluctuations to explain it.

"I've got various smart plugs hooked up from a few different brands, Until recently I would just ask ""Turn on the TV"" and the TV in the livingroom would turn on, For the Bedroom or Kids TV I'd have to say which room it was is, ""Turn on the Bedroom TV"", Now I have to ask for the Livingroom TV to turn on, ""Turn on the TV"" just doesn't work anymore, At the moment If I now ask to turn off the bedroom TV for example, it says it cannot connect and to check the network connection, but if I ask to turn off the fan which is on a dual smart plug, it can deal with that just fine. But if I say ""Goodnight"" It will turn off the tv without issue, I think something might have changed recently and its messed with the naming of my devices"
"I have two 3rd gen echo dots, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. For some reason they both randomly chime an elevating “dun DUN”. They don’t do it at the same time and pretty rarely. Far as I can tell nothing is disconnecting or connecting to them (they haven’t made that sound when I’ve intentionally connected something) so I’m at a loss."
"Hello! I'm new, I hope this question isn't too obvious.  I freelance and I'm trying to use Alexa to be more efficient at self-scheduling my time. What I want to do is to be able to have generic schedule types that will prompt me throughout the day. I need more flexibility than to have the same exact schedule every week, and I don't want to input the whole schedule every day. I'd like to be able to say ""Alexa, tomorrow is schedule A"" and have her prompt me that grouping of reminders throughout the day. Does that make sense?"
"So I just asked my echo dot 3rd gen to turn on the lights in my room as I was laying down for bed and it made the chime and response but it was in a super distorted, robotic voice. Almost like the speakers were broken. Think electrical interference. Anyways I sat up real fast cause what the hell was that (it was very loud, way louder than I have the Alexa set). I asked it to do a sound check and it’s been fine ever since, no unusual noises coming from it. Anyone ever experienced this before?"
"So I’ve had my Alexa for nearly 3 years now, no issues. Every night I use the “Ambient Noise” skill to play white noise, and every night it works great. However a few days ago I went to open it like I always do and her response was “Getting it from Fire TV”. So I tried again. Same thing. Tried to get her to open “Sleep Sounds” (another skill) and same thing. Asked her for the weather and that was fine, she gave me that. Asked her to do another white noise skill (Ocean Sounds) and she did that.  Asked for the Ambient Noise skill again and same thing. The next night I tried again  and all was well, so I thought it was a glitch, but it’s doing the same thing today.   Does anybody know why this is happening or how to fix it? I did have a Fire TV Stick I had associated with Alexa, but I’ve given it to my dad and no longer have it, although I can’t delete it from my Alexa app devices menu. However I don’t think this is the problem as it seems to be random and the Fire Stick hasn’t been here since it started doing this. The only two skills I have that it’s done this with are Ambient Sounds and Sleep Sounds, the others all work fine. Is it a skill related issue?"
"So I'm trying to figure out if this is doable.  Config:  Ring stick up cam Ring alarm hub Leviton zwave switch controlling outside lights  Alexa can control all the above, but the scheduling is a little weird.  Here's what I'm trying to do:  1. This works already: 15 minutes before sunrise, turn on outside lights. Then at 1015, turn off the outside lights. 2. This is where it's a little tricky... From 1015 to sunrise, I want the lights to turn on if motion is detected and back off 15 minutes later.  It seems I can't schedule a window of time to sunrise for something like this.  So I thought maybe just set the end time to 7am, then set another routine to turn the lights off at sunrise.  But then if motion is detected after sunrise the lights turn back on and don't turn off.    Any thoughts on how to do this cleanly without 5 different fail safe routines for morning times?  Thanks!"

I really wanna be able to use voice control to play songs and playlists on spotify, but I want to route the audio through my computer and out of my nice studio monitors.    I considered just using audio out through my interface, but that would take up inputs that I could use elsewhere and make volume control more complicated. Is there any way to route audio through a computer?"
I have no idea which one since I have 10 of them. They all seem to be working fine.   How do I make it stop?
"So I've got two dots and used them for Spotify.   But for some reason it stopped working. I can't even select one dot, but only those two together.  Before: smartphone, Alexa 1, Alexa 2, pair of both Now: smartphone, pair of both  And the music seems to play, according to Spotify, but there's no sound. Only happened, when I tried to use both together.   And it's not like that the song is loading or anything. It's just ""playing"" with no sound for hours. Sometimes it starts working after waiting for a hour or after restarting both. But this works for maybe 2 songs.    Also the Alexa app seems kinda laggy and inefficient. It feels like, some lone dev tried to make an app, accomplished it, but it's barely working,but still does it's job.. somehow..  Is there a fix or can I take both for target practice? Like that, it's only trash for me anyways, since that was supposed to be the main thing I do with it.  Got that issue since weeks."
"Hi there.   My living room light is connected via Alexa plug and my bedroom is via the Hue skill. My fan is the Dyson skill. I was able to ask Alexa to turn on my living room (light), Dyson/fan and even my room (bedroom). But sometime between the last time I used it this morning to now (~12 hours), it’s stopped responding to the commands. Instead, it tries to turn on my Dyson every single time.  To troubleshoot this, I’ve done the following:  * uninstalled the Alexa app * uninstalled the skills / reinstalled the skills * renamed everything to be more clear (living room for the lights, fan for the Dyson, my room for my bedroom) * restarted my phone and cycled through step 2 and 3  However, no mater how many times I do a combination of the three, Alexa doesn’t recognize turning off the lights. Help! This is driving me nuts"
"Activated it and one phone is getting I'm leaving and I'm home notifications the other is not, despite all settings on both iphones set to get all notifications from Alexa app. What am I doing wrong on one of them?"
"“Alexa, floor lights cyan”  This turns the upward facing can lights on and in the color cyan.  Tonight, it just randomly says “I’m sorry, I don’t know how to do that”  Any other color works fine. Brighter, dimmer - not an issue.   The color cyan is apparently now an issue."
Can I include a pair of Bluetooth speakers in my Everywhere group with my Alexa devices?
"I have a couple of echo dots, a phone, a firestick, and a tablet, and if I ask Alexa to play something on my dots, Alexa on the phone and tablet correctly show what's being played on the dots.  On Windows 10, I just get a blank ""now playing"" screen  https://i.imgur.com/LgdPijS.jpg  When I visit the group in Alexa/Win10, Alexa says it can see my lights, but my the dots and firestick are all `Currently not accessible from your PC` https://i.imgur.com/ouK0wR1.jpg  I've checked, all my devices are on the same 2.4Ghz network  So am I doing something wrong, or is this a known limitation of Alexa/Win10?"
Is there a way to access Alexa features like lists and alarms from a desktop computer?
"I switched from cable internet last week to Verizon Fios and since then my Alexa connecting to my Kasa smart switches have been intermittent at best.  The Kasa app works perfectly but Alexa shows ""Device is unresponsive"" for various switches at various times.  I've kept the same mesh router - Google WiFi - during the change to Fios but it's odd that it's impacted Alexa's ability to communicate with Kasa reliably.    WiFi coverage is excellent in all parts of my house and the Kasa app itself works great.  I've disabled and re-enabled the Kasa skill to no avail.  Any clues as to what might be causing the problem?"
"My favorite pandora station she no longer understands,  (JJ Gray) and ALWAYS plays Jason Gray instead, unless she just plays something unrelated on Amazon, but never what I want.  This just started a week ago or so."
Anyone else suddenly have problems telling Alexa to “brighten” or “dim” their Phillips hue light strip? For months I’ve been telling her “bright tv light strip to xx%” and now all of a sudden I’m being hit with “i don’t know how to turn tv light strip to that setting” but if you say “turn tv light strip on to xx%” it works.   Anyone?
"I have a fire stick and echo dot, and I’m trying to pair them to the same Bluetooth speakers in a way that I don’t have to manually switch between which device is using them. I’d imagine there’s some way that my fire stick’s audio output could be routed through the Echo Dot, and then to the speakers, but I can’t figure it out. Any suggestions?"
"Hi all, first post here! I have a brand new Tuya diffuser connected through the TuyaSmart app and the Alexa app, and although I am able to power it on and off etc using Alexa, it still is marked as unresponsive in the Alexa app. I’ve seen similar posts before regarding Tuya products, and I followed previous recommendations (ie using the TuyaSmart app, disabling and reenabling the skill) but nothing has worked. Any help is appreciated!"
"Does anyone remember the Google Home superbowl ad with the old guy and it was talking about how Google Home helped him remember the old days with his departed wife? I've linked it below. Anyway, I'm dying and am wondering if y'all have any suggestions on how to use Alexa to record memories, especially of my partner and I? My memory is going so it would be nice for me but I'd like it for him too after I'm gone.   [Referenced Ad](https://youtu.be/6xSxXiHwMrg)"

"As of last night, all of my Smartthings devices stopped working and displayed "" Device Unresponsive"" in the Alexa app. I removed and reinstalled the Smartthings skill, then told Alexa to discover new devices, but still doesn't work."
"Alexa ""groups"" are not quite up to snuff.  Like Jean-Luc, many of us have several toilet fans and ceiling fans throughout our house. We'd love to say ""Turn on Fan"" and have Alexa recognize the device / room / group and be smart enough.  In Jean-Luc's case, his device was called ""L43 S21CC Toilet Fan"".  You can't actually expect the good captain to remember that, can you??  Well, the point is that he shouldn't have to.  Currently, Alexa groups only keep two aliases: ""Lights"" and ""Speakers"".  That's simply not enough.  Alexa engineers could go about enabling better device recognition one of two ways:  1) Allow user-defined aliases.  For example, let Jean-Luc add ""Fan"" as an alias to his group, and then add ""L43 S21 CC Toilet Fan"" device to that alias. Done. Now he just needs to say ""Turn on Fan"" or ""Turn on Fans"".  2) Allow for group / device character recognition.  For example, suppose his group was called ""L43 S21 CC"".  Okay, so clearly when he said ""Toilet Fan"" perhaps Alexa would first look within the group for ""... Toilet Fan""!  Or really, both approaches would be nice, and are essentially compatible with each other.  Further, we should be able to address devices by Alias-""in""-Room.  For example, Jean-Luc should be able to say ""Computer, I forgot, please turn on my Toilet Fan in Captain's Chambers""."
Amazon posted a new article a few days ago with some new Alexa features that released in July. Here's my take on which ones are worth your time:   [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/new-alexa-features-july-2020/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/new-alexa-features-july-2020/)  Source: [Amazon's post](https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_aeggs_2a1_cta_w?node=21358360011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-18&amp;pf_rd_r=0YH4FN2D9A04W3W9713K&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=3c95ea66-60e6-4092-941d-64367c1dec4c&amp;pf_rd_i=17978648011)
"Alarms have to be ""shut up"". Routines do not.  A routine can be made to announce a phrase at a specific time without needing feedback. I use a routine to wake me up - the lights come on, a fan comes on - no feedback required. I use another routine to announce when it's time to leave for work.   ""It's time to go to work""."
"Hi,  I try to turn all lights on/off in the living room but alexa says more than one device share the same name. It’s so annoying. I have 3 groups, living room, dining room and bedroom. The 2 hue lights in the living room are called, sideboard and turntable. I have just recently bought the bridge with 3 lights"
It's very weird. I don't understand why she isn't playing the right tracks. It was working fine an hour ago. Spotify if that matters
"As the title says, does anyone know how I can play spotify on the Echo Show 8 and use browser at the same time? I’m only using Firefox for recipes because Alexa doesn’t pull up/suggest recipes I need. She’s also kind of glitchy.  When I’m playing spotify and go to use a browser, the music just stops. I can’t play music without Alexa going back to the music screen. Anyone know how I can fix this?"
For example can I use Alexa purely for voice commands to control my desktop Spotify app? Similar to how I can control my desktop app through my phone?  Appreciate any insight.
Anyone have something like this happen?   I changed my location to my new address but get weather warnings for the old address.   How can I fix this?
"Alexa is saying that she's connected and playing, but won't play anything. And from Spotify, Alexa won't be shown on the listed devices.  Already tried turning on and off, logging out and on and nothing seems to work. I remember this happening a few months ago on a really large scale, but I don't see anyone else having this issue"
I used to have Alexa wake me up with the radio by gradually increasing volume. I would set it to half an hour before I needed to be up.  One day it just stopped working and she would randomly start playing radio in the middle of the night at full volume.  I'm back to work now so I want my alarm back but I can't find the increase in volume with radio anywhere!
"I have a second generation echo dot, bought cheaply during a promotion.  It has worked great as an alarm clock, to check the weather, and most importantly control my room lighting without having to get up or fumble for a phone.  But the recognition failures are irritating.  I think it works maybe 70 percent of the time.  The other 30 I have to repeat myself.  I am curious if the newer and more expensive devices - like say the echo plus second generation - have better voice recognition."
"For example,  My wife and I both have Alexa installed using the same credentials. Can you set up a location based routine that would do X actions if BOTH phones enter or leave an area? Quick example would be I want all lights off and thermostat up when both phones LEAVE the area. On the inverse, I want lights on and thermostat down when either/or ENTER the area. How this makes sense."
Is there any talk of Alexa getting an upgrade to allow it to switch from home to guard automatically rather than having to ask?
"Hi, my house has speakers that aren’t connected to anything. No receiver or anything. All they have are the speaker wires.   What I wanna know is what exactly do I need to get to connect those speaker wires to my alexa. Tryna keep it as simple and cheap as possible.   Anyone have ideas?   I believe I need a receiver for the speaker wires and then that receiver needs to be able to connect to an alexa? Is there an easier option than that? Need any and all suggestions"
Thanks :)
"In a near future, it would be nice to have a way to connect a led strip to Alexa to light up when we say the wake word.  Like a ceiling led strip turning off&gt;blue when we trigger her."
"I just moved, and I set up all my Alexa devices to the new address and tested each by asking the weather, but last night I got severe weather alerts for my old location (500 miles away) the old location isn’t even available on my location options, any idea where it could be coming from?"
"I just got a ring security system and was setting up routines to announce door openings and closings, but it seems I can’t do it to announce on all alexas just one at a time. Am I missing something?"
" My name is Yonatan, and I am a 30-year-old entrepreneur. Over the past three months, I have worked extensively to develop an Alexa Skill that helps households to save money and manage their home inventory through a unique voice interface.  The system allows you to:  * Save more time with an auto-generated grocery list that is sent to your email when it's time restock. * Save money by using relevant coupons and discounts based on your real consumption. * Be notified when items are running out or about to expire, and stop wasting food.  All this good can be controlled from your Alexa app when you're out, or at home using simple voice commands such as:  ""Alexa, how many Bananas do I have in my kitchen?""  ""Alexa, how much milk is left in my kitchen?""  We are currently in the final development phase of private Beta and will be happy to have as many testers as possible to optimize the product before its official launch.

"I have created a routine that will turn on my hue lights and have my Alexa say a phrase. I am using a hue sensor but the only issue is that whenever there is any motion it will play the routine. So whenever there is new motion in the room which is like every 2 seconds it will repeat the routine. Is there any way to make it so that when motion is detected the routine will play, and it won't play again until after 15 minutes? ( I hope that made sense)"
"Audible is so quiet on the Echo Dot compared to her voice. Is there a way to have her play Audible for a set amount of time from a command? I can imagine how to add volume changes to that as well, but Audible stumps me."
"Recently got the Fire TV Cube and have it set up in the bedroom so I moved the Echo to the living room. When I say ""Alexa, turn on TV"" and the bedroom door is open, the living room TV powers on as well. I separated the Fire TV Cube and the Echo device into separate groups in my Alexa app into bedroom and living room respectively and it still turns on the other TV. I thought maybe I should assign different names to the TVs but I only see one TV listed under devices along with the Echo and the Fire TV Cube. How can I fix this issue? Any help would be appreciated."
I was thinking on mounting a fire tablet onto the wall to use awe a hub for all my smart home appliances and also to use it for Alexa. What’s the best way to do this and how do you set up the tablet so it’s only showing smart home things? (Sorry if I worded question wrong)
I haven’t heard too much about the update. I’m curious... what do you think?  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/i22i3b)
"I bougt an Echo wall clock. Set up by Alexa took a minute, but the next day connection failed, it disappeared from the devices list and I can’t get it connected again. I performed a factory reset several times, installed new batteries, tried to connect with both the Echo device and the app: all failed. Any advice to solve this?"
"In the early 1990's I set up an X10 system that would sound a bell when someone drove up my driveway, and if it was dark out it would turn on 4 floodlights and an inside light for about 15 Min.  I bought an Echo Plus, 4 smart light switches and a smart light bulb. I started trying to make a routine to replace my X10. I can have the echo make a sound and turn the lights on when there is motion, but I can not add a second trigger to include the ""if it is dark"" to the equation.   I have been googling and have found a couple of VERY complicated ways using to or three other programs and hops to the internet and back to make this work, but nothing simple, that might work when the internet is down."
"So I've got Alexas all over the house. Recently switched to Spotify from Prime Music. It's a Family Spotify account, my son can play the music he wants from his phone while I play the music I want from my phone. Is there a way we can do the same through the multiple Alexa devices in the house. Currently if I'm listening to my music in the living and he asks Alexa to play music in his room my music will stop playing in order for him to listen to his music."
"So, I connected alexa to xbox, she can control it and turn it off for me perfectly but whenever I try to turn xbox on with alexa she says she can't reach or communicate with xbox. I have 'instant-on' turned on and voice assistant enabled, everything works fine except for turning it on, anybody have any ideas how to fix this?"
"Hi! Let me start by saying I know little to nothing about Alexa or smart lighting. My wife thinks it's neat and I wanted to try it, but I'm not sure if it would work with our wifi. We live in an apartment complex that has a shared connection, with each apartment having its own VPN. At least that's how I think it works- I'm not a network engineer either. To connect to the internet you enter the wifi password, then it directs you to the ISP website where you input a second username and password for your individual unit.  Would I be able to use Alexa and smart light bulbs such as [these](https://www.amazon.com/Candelabra-Changing-Compatible-Chandelier-Equivalent/dp/B081L4Q5HH/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=LED+Candelabra+Bulbs+E12+Base%2C+Color+Changing+and+Dimmable+Smart+Light+Bulb%2C+Compatible+with+Alexa+Google+Home%2C+Tunable+White+Chandelier+Light+Bulbs+320+lm+35w+Equivalent%2C+3+Pack&amp;qid=1596306018&amp;sr=8-2) with my apartment's wifi?"
"I’ve done the setup but I can’t get Alexa to control either Roku or directv box.  I can’t find online what to say to Alexa to get it to recognize either one?  I say Roku, directv, tv but nine work."
Alexa keeps calling me by my mom’s name because we sound very similar. We share an account but we have different echo’s at totally different locations. I’ve tried deleting and making a new voice profile and it still keeps happening. Any advice??
"I have Ring's alarm that starts Alexa guard when armed, and I'd like Alexa guard to arm my blink system. Is there a way to set this up to work automatically?"
"All,  I am unable to create a routine with location. under ""When this happens"" , the only options I see are - ""Voice"" , ""Schedule"" , ""Smart Home"" &amp; ""Alarms"" .

"Hello, I'm not sure if here's the place to be asking this kind of question, but I got to know how to fix this.   I currently have my Echo Dot with an AUX Cable that goes into Line In port on the back of my computer. Using Voicemeeter Potato to power everything (desktop speakers/wireless headphones/WMR headphones &amp; mic).   Everything's setup great, no issues (other than having to hit certain macro keys to get things working), but there's a problem. I can record my voice, but I cannot record the voices of others (in games/Discord).   Aka if there's drama going on and my friend wants me to record the conversation, I'm unable to help with this.     The only thing I can think of, is I have to have a 3rd mic (or something).. I dunno. I need help if this is even possible."
"these are both currently on offer for the same price, which is better? i dont need the home hub built in to the plus."
On both my echo show 5. They just hang after it says “Here’s what you haven’t heard yet today. From Reuters...”.  I’ve tried restarting. Anyone else?
"After seeing a post on here a few days ago about Guard finally being available in the UK I instantly signed up.

I struggle with ADHD and have gotten in the bad routine of dismissing my alarms by voice commands while I'm half-asleep. Is there a way to set an alarm to only be disabled by pressing a button and not voice commands? So that I can force myself to get out of bed and walk to the Echo.
"Hey everyone! Time to wrap up July. This month comes to 80 commands to try. While that number alone may sound daunting, I’ve compiled a few of my favorite commands in the below roundup.

"I just got a new dog and I wanted to see if there's a setting /skill on Alexa that will send me an alert every time my dog barks when I leave the house?   He barks loudly and hes in the same room as Alexa. Basically it would be like Guard Mode but instead of detecting glass breaking it would detect dog barking (or if its easier, any large noise that is made, since there aren't any large noises other than his bark anyway).

Been having this issue for months and customer service suggests the same stuff which is restarting. They have me a 15% off coupon but fuck that I've barely had this thing a year so I'm not gonna buy a new i e if this one is ready giving me issues.
"Hi all,   I've recently gotten an Echo Dot that I hooked up to my kitchen stereo via a 3.5mm cable. It's always playing music, and when Alexa speaks her voice is really low to the point that I absolutely can't hear what she's saying unless I'm really really close to one of the speakers. When she speaks she either turns off the music completely or turns the music volume so low that I can't hear it.  This issue doesn't exist when I'm disconnecting the 3.5mm cable, Alexa's voice is the same volume as the music, and when she speaks the music volume goes down (but isn't muted) so you can hear her just fine. The problem is that I want to use the stereo since the speaker on the Dot is too small and crappy.  Things I've tried already:  - resetting the device - using a different cable - turn the alarm volume all the way up - turn off whisper mode  None of these worked. From what I can tell many people have the opposite problem - their voice volume is too loud for them so I couldn't find a solution to my problem yet.  Any ideas?  Thanks!"
I’d like things I buy every week to automatically re-add themselves to the list.  This seems like such a typical function but I can find any way to do this. Anyone found a workaround?
"Anyone who uses the Pioneer Vozsis with Alexa app have any luck with using Alexa for navigation?  The [tutorial video shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROYDlUX3Xbc) the ability for Alexa to at least speak about traffic conditions and give you nearby businesses with the distance and to ""take me to the first one.""  When I try this, Alexa either says she is getting directions and then stops and never does, or says she doesn't have that skill.  Curious as to where Alexa is pulling the traffic and navigation info from. Can't find a skill that would be obvious to activate either."
So like a dummy I enabled Alexa guard for my house and immediately regretted it. We use [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) for our security system and now any of my usual Alexa commands for [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) security are being conflated with this Guard thing. I tried to Google how to remove this and came up short. Scoured the Alexa app (mobile and desktop) and don't see anything there either. I also made an email request to Amazon Alexa about it. Has anyone gotten rid of Guard recently?
"Ok so, ive been having my echo dot for months now and i've tried to hook up my dot to my smart tv for home theatre.  The sound works perfectly and the lag is unnoticeable.

"I received two Echo Dots (3rd gen) for free along with a Christmas gift this past year.  We are an Apple/Siri household so they’ve been sitting unused for months until now...  I’d like to set these up in each of my kids’ room (11 and 7), with the idea that I’d like them to be able to ask Alexa to set an alarm, control some smart plugs in their rooms, access our Apple Music subscription, and for me to announce stuff to them (both individually and together).  I don’t have an Alexa device myself, just the app on my iPhone which I would use to set up the Dots, and use to drop in/send announcements.  Here are my questions:  My kids each have their own iPads (not phones).  Does it make sense for me to set everything up from my phone or should I set up each from the Alexa app on each of their iPads?  I’d like to be able to control each kid from dropping in on each other (likewise, I don’t feel the need to “drop in” on my kids, but I still would like to “intercom” back and forth if possible).  My main concern being my older kid being an ass and announcing at all hours and waking up my younger one.  I’d also like to limit each kid from triggering scenes or turning smart devices on and off in each others’ rooms...  Am I going about this correctly?  Should I be doing different accounts/linking inside a household/having the Alexa app on each kid’s iPad?  Being completely new to Alexa, skills, etc I’m not sure the best way to do this and still maintain some control!  Thanks!"
Hey all - I want to get a weather station clock (mine just died) that works with Alexa. Mostly I want it to be able to tell indoor and outdoor temperature and use that information to run routines. Is there one that everyone prefers? Thanks.
Can you add this to a speaker group “everywhere”? It’s louder than my dot but I can’t add it
I am new to voice development and would like to get some feedback on what you struggle with Alexa.
Any experiences on this kind of setup? or maybe another setup that actually works considering the person who will be using the EchoDot?  Thank you and have a nice day!
"So, the new Alexa installed on my tablet and phone. Now what? The main screen still has random stuff I do not use or have little interest in. Thought maybe Spotify, my default music app, would appear front and center. Nope. ""Start a list"" is first. I've never made a list in Alexa. Next are 3 random skills...none of the skills I've added and use. So, duh! What's the point?"
"So my setup goes like this: My windows 10 PC to my USB Scarlet Focusrite 2i2 to my studio monitors.  I want Alexa to play/speak through my studio monitors instead of the default echo speaker. My monitors can only connect to my Audio interface, and my audio interface to my PC.  Can I get this to work? (No AUX, via bluetooth only)"
"Hey. I’ve set up my Echo dot to work with my phone and Apple Music playlist, and it works perfectly. However, I’ve tried to add my wife’s phone to it so she can play her Apple Music playlist through it too, but it’s not working. I’ve downloaded the Alexa app, enabled the skill, but when I tell it to play her playlist, it plays the same random song which happens to contains her name, not her playlist. Any help please?"
Basically got an email saying the printer connected to alexa without manually adding it myself.  Is this normal?  Thanks!
i use my alexa to play music at night. my typical request is to shuffle music by cavetown. up until a week ago it's been playing all the songs. now it only plays one and stops. i know it's not because they're only allowed to play one song because each time it'll start with something different. any idea how to fix it?
"I want to replace my current light switch with something that will trigger Alexa routines.  Something like an echo button, but one that is hard wired to run off of 120V AC, and (ideally) slots into a 1 gang switch box.    Is there anything like that on the market?  All of the ""Smart Switchs"" I see are switches that control a load (not trigger a routine).    I am ok using IFTT or SmartThings.  At this point, I am just tired of buying and trying things - I would really appreciate some feedback as to exactly what to buy."
"Has anyone out there found a good Alexa enabled speaker selector? I just moved into a house with a home theater system across a few different rooms (4) that connect wired to a manual speaker selector switch box.  I have to press a switch on the box to change between the Living Room and Kitchen for example.   I’m looking for a speaker selector meant for wired speakers like mine, that also has an Alexa skill to switch between the different speakers. My search online doesn’t turn up any hardware like this.  The speakers in the house are built in and good quality, but I play all my music through Alexa (and so do my kids)!  Would love to be able to get the best of both worlds here. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!"
"I've tried everything, but it seems that no matter what I do, the Alexa app won't let me enter my phone number. It just flashes a white screen and says Something went wrong, please try again.   I'm in Canada and my phone number is associated with my amazon.ca account.   Wondering if anyone else experienced this."
"When I recharge my camera batteries, I have to be careful not to overcharge them.  Is there a skill or routine that would allow me to instruct Alexa to tun off a switch after 2 hours?  Or would I have to instruct her ever time?  Can I say something like ""Alexa turn power plug off at 2am?"""

I was curious if anyone has had any experience in using it as an outlet timer (Similar to the kind you might use for christmas lights).     I recently got a new reptilian pet and I'd like to know if it can be used with my Alexa or the Alexa app to tell it to turn off or on at specific times of the day, or if it would explicitly have to be told to turn the light fixture off or on.  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you ahead of time!"
"Just a word of caution to those thinking about or in the process of creating any Coronavirus related skills. I was notified in response to my certification application with the following information:  ""In an effort to ensure accuracy and consistency of information shared  with our customers, we are limiting skills about COVID-19 at this time."""
I work 4 days a week and would like to be able to set routines for M-Th morning. I don't exactly want to wake up at 5am on Friday but also would prefer not remaking the routine for everyday as it's currently multiple routines between music alarm in various rooms changing volume over time turning on lights etc.
"I recently added my adult daughter to my Amazon household account.  Since doing so, all her Amazon devices now show up in my Alexa app.  Can I remove them?  Is there any harm in leaving them?  I already got a notification for a package delivery for her on my Echo Dot.  I’d prefer not to get these.  I’m afraid if I turn off notifications, she won’t get them either.  Help me guys and girls!"
"My little girl has an Alexa in her room. This is linked up to my account as are both Fire sticks we have (one fire stick downstairs in the living room, the other in little girls room). The problem I’m having is that anytime my little girl wants to listen to the Descendants 3 soundtrack for the 6000th time, it also starts playing through the TV downstairs.   How do I get this to stop? Sick of my programmes being interrupted by Disney 😩"
"That is, right now, if I ask her to play a song, she says, ""Playing 'This is America' by Childish Gambino,"" then she plays the song.  I'd like it if she'd just start playing.  Likewise, if I ask her what 215 times 332 is, she has to read the question back to me before answering.  Any chance there's a way to get her to skip the recaps?  Thanks!"
Could anyone please help or tell me how to fully factory reset my alexa as if it were brand new i have no clue how ?
Could Alexa handle an alarm 7 days a week set to go off half an hour before sunrise?
"New app:  My 6AM alarm will not play music (Pandora) anymore, only sound (beeps).  Pandora still works, I tried ""Alexa play Yes radio"" and it played fine. Then I looked at ""Activity"" and the useless card says on ""Pandora Station"" with a link to 'Browse Pandora'. Selecting the link yields a message that you must be using the latest version of the Alexa app... sigh  So, is anyone else having issues?"
"I've FireTV, Echo (2nd Gen), and Fire HD 10 in the same room. I want Alexa to show me my calendar on my Fire HD 10 only. But, saying ""Alexa..."" would trigger all devices simultaneously. How do I ask just the Fire Tablet? Thanks."
is it too much to ask for floor organization? if i have to say “alexa turn off the third floor hallway light” one more time i might scream. but thats only 10% of my frustration the other 90% is my brain running around in circles trying to figure out why it isnt already a thing and if im missing some hugely obvious reasoning.
Just purchased the Amazon Fire stick and love it so far. Wondering if anyone knows if it’s possible to connect the stick to a speaker group? Would love to play tv audio around the house.
"Was sitting here getting ready to play my game, just me and my partner in the room when all of a sudden Alexa goes ""Well hello there, I'm so glad you're here"""
"Hi all,  Annoying problem that started last week.  Have a Pandora station I have used with Alexa for years.  ""Alexa, play J-Pop Radio on Pandora"".  It goes to my linked Pandora account and plays my station.  Sine last week it refuses to play this station from voice command.  It alternatively plays a Justin Timberlake and other pop artist stations, or a couple of other pop stations.  I go in, delete these new stations from Pandora's collection, but it Alexa keeps adding them back.    First World Problems, I know.  But it's really irritating.  Is there a way to map a specific station to an Alexa routine?  I tried naming my station directly in a routine but it still picks a random pop station.  Thanks"
"Does anyone else have as a problem that they ask Alexa to play on one device, but she plays on our device in a completely different room. it's not just that the wrong device Is picking up, because I've had it play and the basement where it physically can't hear the person on the other end of the house upstairs.  If you have, how do you did fix it?"
"So a little while back my area had a power outage. All of our devices had to be logged into again and reset, including our Alexa devices. However, now one of my echo dots no longer accepts my WiFi password during set up mode. It didn’t do this before the power outage. I’m just wondering what I should be doing? Should I reset the router? I’m not very tech savvy so any help is greatly appreciated!"
"Apologies if this is a common question – we are using two separate voice profiles in our house, each with their own Spotify account. Works perfectly switching between the two accounts depending who speaks.  Question is, how do I change which Spotify plays if Alexa *doesn't* recognise the voice, i.e. the fallback default one. Or does it just automatically use the last profile it was on?"
I ask alexa to play black by Dutchavelli and she plays one of his other songs
"Here's the final newsletter for July. Commands are all over the place this week. Highlights include a mixed bag of new games, Pokemon, Warf, translation improvements, and Alexa Live updates.  Check out the full list here:  [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-july-27th/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-july-27th/)   Let me know if you found any interesting skills or commands this week."
"Hey everyone, my echo input works like a charm until I ask it what time it is. Regardless of time of day or how recent my resetting was it will just blink and do nothing. Then, for every subsequent command, it immediately turns off after the activation word until I reset it and repeat the process. Anyone have any idea what could be causing this?   Tldr: echo input stops working when I ask it for the time"
"I really love Alexa and my Echos devices. Having said that the discrepancies between different devices and the available wake words are a consternation for me.  My oldest son is named Alexander (born long before Alexa was released) and everybody calls him Alex, as everybody can guess, calling him triggers all Alexas within earshot. So we change the wake word. I didn’t especially fancy talking to ‘Amazon’ so we changed it to ‘Echo’ (there are also too many ‘Computer’s at home to avoid that wake word).  Now my first surprise was when I got my Echo Auto and had to find out that I cannot change the wake word at all! The device is great IMO but guess what, I am still driving with my son in the car and talk to him (or about him with my wife).  Just now I got a Fire Tablet 7 and of course the first thing I wanted to do was change the wake word. You can but the only choices are ‘Alexa’ and ‘Amazon’...  Why oh why!?!? This can bring a grown man close to tears. &lt;/rant&gt;  P.S.: I realize that changing my son’s ‘wake word’ would be the path of least resistance here but alas I think he has grown fond of it (= not an option) 😉"
"Found I had 96 skills enabled. Wondering if this is the cause of some of the sillyness you get when she doesn't respond correctly, or something dumb happens. Thinking that each skill was adding trigger words and terms that might have been inadvertently picked up while asking for other stuff.  No way we installed most of the skills. Trivia games, news, other crap. Perhaps some get pushed as a featured skill or something. Could see a few mistakes on my end, but no way 96.  I see regular posts for Alexa inaccuracies, maybe something to look at for others."
"My dude and I are watching tv and doing homework. Alexa suddenly started saying a website. Super random and weird.  Then, she stops and starts again staying she “cant find device ‘first light.”"
"I tried a trick I saw online that said to type ""My Playlist (insert playlist name)"" but when I did it, it would reply ""I can't find (playlist) on Spotify"".   Anyone have this figured out? I want to set up some routines to change my lights and play specific playlists for different moods."
"Hi All,  I have two Amazon Echo 3rd gens that I would like to use as a stereo pair, HOWEVER, I do not want to have to use the Amazon Music app in order to do so. If I connect the two using an aux-to-aux cable, will it allow me to stream music by bluetooth to one of the Echoes, which would in turn play from the 2nd Echo that is connected by the cord - essentially functioning as a ""slave"" speaker?  Thanks!"
"Hello Could anyone help why on my Fire Stick 4K I am having issues logging in to apps like A&amp;E and History with my Cox Cable credentials, in particular they bring up the Cox website in the app instead of entering a activation code like with Paramount, and when I enter the correct credentials it just goes back to select provider and when I select Cox again it closes it self, also just to note I have already restarted my Fire Stick and reinstalled the problem apps?"
"I have two Fire Cubes and for some reason, one of them keeps sporadically losing connection to Hulu. Sometimes it plays for 20 minutes, sometimes it plays for 3 minutes. It goes to the Hulu “connection lost” screen, then back to the Hulu home screen. I’m not sure what’s happening!   We’ve changed remotes, changed WiFi networks (5g to 2.4g), deleted and reinstalled the app, and obviously rebooted the cube multiple times.   The PlayStation Hulu app in the same room doesn’t have the same issue, and the Fire Cube upstairs plays fine, too. Any advice?"
"Just told alexa; ""Living Room TV Off"", as I do all the time.  This time the response I got was; ""No, living rooms are not televisions""   That is exactly what she said.  We laughed so hard."
"I've got a problem in which every so often, one of my Kasa switches goes offline and Alexa can't seem to find it.  But I've identified the cause, my smartwatch (Galaxy).  It's off most of the time as I only wear it if I'm going out, and well, these days there's not much of that.  But when I turn it on it connects to wifi and bluetooth and the Kasa switch fails.  Once the watch is turned off and the router is reset the switch might come back online, though sometimes I have to pull that out of the socket to reset it.  I have six smart lights in the house, another Kasa switch which seems unaffected and a tablet on the wifi, surely it's not too much load for the router?  I'm in Australia on FTTP NBN."
"Hi all, I received my echo and also an echo dot today, after messing about trying to get the echo set up to WiFi it worked.   Now I’m trying to set my echo dot up in my bedroom, it’s the 3rd generation one. For some reason it’s doing what the echo done when I went to set it up, instead of telling me to connect to the amazon WiFi first it’s just trying to connect to my home WiFi and it won’t go no further than that, just says it’s offline  How do I get it to connect to the amazon WiFi first as the echo required me to? By the way I have no idea how I even got to that stage on the echo  If someone could help please before I bang my head against the wall, I’ve tried resetting etc"
"I started noticing recently Alexa has been answering super slow, I'm talking 8-9 seconds to acknowledge VS her normal 1-3 seconds. Or sometimes she just doesn't at all. This has only started recently. Any idea?"
Im planning to buy alexa and some smart lights
"Hey guys,  I am currently playing with my Amazon Echo and stumbled onto an idea of displaying text or showing websites on, let's say, a monitor while I use my custom skills. Does anyone have any experience or can point me in the right direction to get started on this?"
"I got a new dimmer switch a few weeks ago.  Now it's not working 100%. I can't turn the lights on and off, but it won't let me dim the lights. It just says ""not responding, please check network, bla bla.  I feel that resetting it will work, but is there an easier way to fix this?"
"I have two Echo Dots and multiple other smart devices throughout my home. All the other devices connect just fine but one day this one Dot disconnected from the network and when I try to reconnect it’s saying the WiFi password is wrong. I work in tech support so normally when it says the password is wrong, the password is wrong but I was looking at the WiFi password side by side and it matched. I even went so far as to change my WiFi password and reconnect everything and same deal, all my other devices reconnected except for that one Dot. Any help? Thanks in advance!"
My Alexa will be coming tomorrow I was wondering if I set a sleep timer after listening to music and I had an alarm set up for the morning will if work or will the sleep timer stop the morning alarm working?  Sorry if it’s stupid question it’s my first one
"So I just recently got my Toshiba FireTV, and I've been using it for a couple months now, controlling Spotify with my remote that came with the TV.  I have an Alexa Echo Dot Gen. 3 plugged in on the dresser besides my TV.  I have it all linked to my TV, and I know how to launch apps and watch YouTube and Hulu on it with my Alexa when I don't want to use the remote, but I'm not quite sure how to pull up a certain playlist on Spotify with Alexa.   Is this possible? I have a personal playlist I want to listen to, but it doesn't seem to work."
"I'm seriously considering getting rid of Alexa and I wish I never got so immersed with it. We bought our first Echo a few years ago and loved it. We joined Prime then Amazon Music. Then a Dot in the kitchen. Then another upstairs. Then my kids room.   But now I find myself not using it hardly at all because it more often than not does not do what I want it to do anymore.   1. Terrible recognition of voice, notable deterioration over time.  2. Terrible recognition of songs and artists on Amazon Music.  3. Terrible at answering everyday questions. Easier to use Google on my phone. 4. Really hard to cancel or change alarms and reminders without using the app, again might as well use my phone. 5. Really hard work remembering exact phrases to get her to do basic things. Very intuitive at times. 6. Smart home devices no quicker than doing it yourself. 7. Stupid reliance on third party 'skills' to provide basic information like the news and weather. Most skills are really awful and often don't work. In the UK I cannot get a working news skill, nor accurate weather nor pollen count anymore. 8. Does random stuff. Asked for weather in Dungeness, about 20miles from my home town. She gives weather for Dungeness, GA, USA. My device is registered to my home, my account is in the UK. Why?  Overall the user experience although good at times, is mostly just frustrating at best and downright infuriating at worse. For the annual Prime fee plus music subscription I'm not happy.  What's the alternative? Google or is that as bad? Spotify? Nothing?"
"When I click on devices , it still has just my old echo and I have to click on all devices to see my new main one. How do I make my new main one appear first?"
What’s the coolest/most impressive set up or trick you’ve got her doing for you?  I’m pretty sure I’m missing out on a lot of cool functionality.
"Hey guys, I came home from work this morning and my Alexa randomly wasn’t connected to the internet. I just spent two hours troubleshooting and the damned thing won’t connect. Everything else is my home is connected to the wi-fi with no issues. Anyone know how I can fix this?"
Morning!  Currently got a combo of echoes at home and use them for multi room - really like it.  I’m interested in adding surround sound to the tv. Are there any surround sound systems that connect to Echo multi room? I’ve seen the Denon range but I think you can just control those with Alexa rather than connect them to a multi room group? Is that true?
"Totally unscientific survey: How many people regularly mute their Echo or unplug them at certain times of the day? Do you turn them off overnight? When you're watching TV? Etc?     I'm just curious to hear what people do when they want to be sure Alexa is not listening, or if people even think it's a problem for them."
Now when I go to setup a new device I don't even have a subwoofer option.
"This is apparently an issue that has been around for a long time however through all of the forums and posts on both Reddit and Amazon and other places I have not found a solid answer that has work for me.   It doesn't matter which device I use to speak to Alexa be at the Alexa app, my echo, or even the Alexa which is present on my TV. I cannot get her to change volume on my TV, I cannot get her to turn my TV on/off, and a few other little bugs however I am able to get Alexa to control almost everything else like switching to certain apps, yada yada yada. I have the option enabled to turn on the TV with Alexa, I have reset the TV since then, I've turned that setting on and off, I've deregistered the tv and re-registered, I have factory reset oh, I have done just about every single thing that has been brought to my attention so far.   Please if anyone has a way that they have fixed this let me know."
"I know this sounds weird, but my home network is all messed up and the only way I can connect to my Alexa to WiFi is if I go through the method where the Alexa device broadcasts a signal, and then I must connect to it via Settings &gt;WiFi on my iPhone - which then successfully connects it to my network. I discovered this by accident when trying to troubleshoot why my Alexa wouldn't connect to WiFi when going through the usual setup. Going through the usual connect to wifi method results in an endless spinning orange wheel.  Does anybody know how to force my Alexa device to broadcast a signal to connect to? Holding the action button for 25 seconds did not work."
"I've several activities listed on my Google Calendar tomorrow. When I ask Alexa to show me my calendar, she reads out first 4 event 'Names' but won't describe durations, locations where the events are at, or description of the events. What command do I need to use? Thanks."
"I previously had 4 Alexa devices (2 dots, one echo, one show) all connected to my Eero mesh system. I then had a house fire which resulted in losing two Alexa devices and one Eero router. The entire Eero system was replaced as were both lost Alexa devices. I was able to connect the Show and one Dot to the new Eero network, but have not been able to connect the second Dot or the Echo 3rd gen. Both were replaced by Amazon and I received 2 Echo 3rd gen. Both of those also fail to connect to Eero. I have spent 2 hours on the phone with Eero that was not helpful and 3 separate calls with Amazon for close to 5 hours total which has also not helped. I have multiple computers, cell phones, tablets, and a hefty Ring security system all connected to the network with no issues but for some reason I am having problems with Alexa devices. I have tried to disconnect all but one router, used the access point router, and tried each router individually all with no help. I have researched several times for these issues and have tried every remedy I've found, but none of the posts or articles were within the last 6 months so I wasn't sure if there may be new fixes someone has come across. Any ideas? Thanks."
I looked on phone for the options to do so but my echo/Alexa just plays the music in order of the playlist.  I always list to my music with shuffle and repeat always on since I like to listen to all my music in one playlist.  Will it work if I ask Alexa to do play the playlist of shuffle? If so what the phrase to say it? Since Alexa would get confused if the phrase is not clear enough.
"Hi r/Alexa  I am moving to a new apartment in about a week. I have always wanted to build a simple and clean smart home system. But wow, there are a LOT of products out there, at different price points, with different configurations.  **I am currently looking to integrate a sound system (Vizio Bluetooth) and smart lighting system (?) with my Amazon Alexa.**  * On the audio front (Vizio), I should be set. However, for lighting -- I could really use some guidance. * I am looking at various smart LED strips to place around my apartment (kitchen, bedroom, living room). * I am also interested in using smart light bulbs. I would love for all my LED strips and bulbs to be seamlessly controlled using my Alexa application.  **As I am trying to integrate multiple LED strips and bulbs together, does anyone have any recommendations on products and best practices to make this a seamless process?**  Thank you!"
"Whenever we amoe a call from one alexa device to another,(kids calling grandparents)   it asks if we want to call from my sister's account.  Wha?  How do I clran up the call from list?  My sister doesn't have a device on my account.   My wife's name is in the list because uses her account on the echo show.  Sister, no clue.  Any ideas where that list lives?"
"I’m hoping someone on the sub might be able to help me. I’ve looked a few places, and can’t find a command to have Alexa skip confirming what she’s playing me, and just go into playing it.   I know you can have song ID off or on that identifies each song starting in a series of songs, but I’m looking to disable her identifying what song she’s about to play after I’ve requested a single, particular song, playlist,or album etc. I know I run the risk of getting the wrong song going without realizing until it’s well into it’s play time, but I’m ok with that.  Anyone know if this can be done?"
I tell her to create a repeat or interval timer and she's got that just fine. The first timer alert goes off but I haven't figured out how to tell her to shut up on the first alert without cancelling the rest of them. How do I do that?

"Is there any way for me to set a trigger for my flatmate? I have Alexa set to turn on my living room lights if my phone ~~joins my home's WiFi~~ enters a certain radius of my home after 7:30 PM and before 6:00 AM.  I'm wondering if I can also set this up to work for my flatmate without logging into my Amazon account on their phone.  Failing that, I'll need to look into getting a smart motion detector, but I'd rather not spend the money."
"Hello Guys,   Are there any update files for the Amazon Echo Show 5 device? I am doing security research and I would like to know if there are any legitimate sources for the files, as I didn't find anything online.  Thank you in advance :)"
"The Language option works just fine when changing settings for my Echo Dot, but the same option doesn't show up for the mobile app itself. Is it locked to my phone's language, or is there a way to change it?"

"Woot is having a great deal on echo shows gen1, along with Ring Doorbell if you need one of those. I picked a couple up last sale and it allowed me to relocate some dots to other areas of the house."
"I want a routine where a light comes on during a song, but if the song is the first thing in a routine, she just completely spaces and doesn't do anything else in the routine?"
I bought an Akaso cam that works with the SmartLife app. It’s already connected to the app and everything seems fine.  My LGTV has the Alexa app and when I ask Alexa to show me the Camera it says ok and it changes to a dark screen that says the name of the camera and says “Loading” but it never shows anything.  Will I have the same issue with an echo show or is it maybe just a TV problem?
"If like me you’ve been waiting for the Echo Studio to go on sale before buying it, Echo Studio is currently £149.99 reduced from £189.99"
I made a spotify routine that at my alarm time will play music off of spotify but if i type in a artists name it will only play “______ radio” wondering if there’s anything to fix this? do i need spotify premium?
"I'm very new to my Echo Dot. I got my Sony Android TV connected, and while it's on I can use Alexa to do all kinds of commands including turning the TV on and off. But she can't seem to turn the TV on when I get home from work. It's like there's some kind of sleep mode or something preventing the Echo to connect with the TV. Once I turn the TV on, then I can have her turn the TV on and off all night long. Anyone ever hear of this? All the stuff I'm googling just gives me instructions for connecting or turning on the Remote TV Controls."
"Everyone involved in pushing this device out years before it’s ready should be ashamed of themselves.   I’ve been simultaneously trying to use Alexa as my primary speaker on a Windows 10 PC while also not throwing the thing off my 2nd story balcony.  The challenge is real.  Bluetooth is the most inconsistent connection protocol I have ever used in my life. Alexa will suddenly stop being connected with no error message and no repeatability. Alexa will randomly refuse reconnection with Bluetooth, all while giving ‘success’ messages. Alexa will refuse to do simple things that should be entry level requirements for a voice activated device (I can’t restart this thing with a voice command? What a bunch of horseshit.)  The settings GUI through a browser is equally horrible. The entire experience has left me never wanting to use any Bluetooth connected device again as long as I live. Let me plug this fucking thing in please.  If any Alexa engineer happens to stumble on this kvetching post in the future: fuck you. I’m on hour two of trying to connect this stupid shit back to my computer even though it was connected fine all morning.  It’s done this a half dozen times in the last month and I’ll be fucked if I understand what I’m doing differently that eventually “works.”   Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
I have a lot of wifi devices connected in my house via the smart life app and i feel it may be slowing down my wifi... all the devices i have a just generic smart plugs and lights ect...  Ideally i would like to keep using the smart life app but need a hub to connect all my devices too... any suggestions?
"Hi, i saw in the alexa app that you can trigger alexa routines via ifttt. Everything i saw on youtube or here was outdated. Does anyboody really know how to make them  work? There was one video that showed that you must say a especific phrase in Alexa in the THIS part of IFTTT but how do i get alexa to run the routine i want? in the THEN part of IFTTT there is no action services related to alexa. Using webhooks didnt do  the trick for me since i cannot call to alexa action services  (like i can to use my harmony hub to turn the tv on or off). I know that you can launch a routine via a specific phrase in the alexa app but i want to make it in ifttt so i can launch the routine though siri too or NFC as i do with my harmony hub. Sorry for my english!"
So i want one of my lights to cycle through colors really fast juts for fun. I’ve tried using routine but it just goes to the next color that I picked after I say the command. How would I set it up so that it cycles between them with one command? Please help.

"Hi,  We’ve long been looking for a way to be able to send quick messages to my mother-in-law. She is absolutely no interest in computers &amp; doesn’t have SMS/texting on her cell phone.   I’ve wondered about a smart assistant device w/ display. We mostly use Google/Nest in our place but I’m also considering the Echo Show. The assisted living facility where she resides has a captive portal free WiFI &amp; they have several of these around for the residents, so I’m sure it’s compatible with their internet.  I have a few questions about the Echo Show that I cannot answer since I don’t yet use it myself:      Is there a way that we could send her messages to the Echo Show and have them show up on screen or at least tell her that they are available so she could ask about it? She does NOT have a smartphone but we both have iOS/Android devices so we could use the Alexa app to send messages. Does she have to have a smartphone to receive messages on the Echo Show?      What would I need to do to set things up so that we could do calling, video calling, and messages via text (I don’t need it to be SMS, just a short message on screen using whatever protocol).       Would she also have access to any music on this without paying extra? Our household has Prime but she does not. She wouldn’t want any popular music but might like some older stuff, hymns, etc. Is there a child sharing option for the free Prime Music or video?    Is there a way we could share photos to her Echo Show?      Is there anything else that can be done on the Echo Show without paying a monthly fee or could we attach her to our Prime in some way? I’m wondering about audiobooks, podcasts, video, news, etc. She has no TV or newspaper and isn’t online so this might provide some interesting connection for her.      Are there any “safety” features that could be enabled - for instance, if she ever fell in her studio apartment, she could call the Echo for help? I seem to remember this being an option without additional fees.    Are there any added features that do cost extra and might be worth paying for? If she can’t afford it, perhaps we could take care of that.    What is needed to setup/configure her Echo Show? Can I do it without having one myself? I could maybe get it sent to me first, I guess or are there other options?      Thanks so much in advance! Sorry for so many questions I just have no way to figure this out myself since I don’t have one (yet!). :)"
May not be possible but I hate saying turn on living room tv or turn on bedroom tv
"I have about a bunch of echo dots and echo shows in my house that I would like to output to the house speakers. I am wondering if it’s even possible.  My plan is to have an echo dot connected to my receiver with an audio jack cable. Is it possible for any echo dot in the house to output to that specific echo and therefore playing through the house speakers by extension? If not, how can I have my echos outputting to my receiver without them being connected via bluetooth nor a cable to the receiver?"
"Is Alexa or the app going to get any needed updates or features anymore? Seems like the last year there hasn’t been anything new. Just “performance and bug fixes”. Last thing new in the past year was that failure voice pack with Samual Jackson.. The app needs a complete rewrite, don’t think it’s changed in years, skills are becoming more and more unreliable and so much things missing like multi voice commands for the same routine etc. For such a super wealthy company they don’t seem to show much if any progress."
"As far as I can tell, ""everywhere"" is an auto generated group with all the echo's. However, one is missing. I went to add it but can't because it's having network issues even though it's fully functional and works in every other aspect.     Any ideas?  UPDATE: Randomly fixed its self."
Does anyone have a dumbed down idiot's guide to saving favourite radio stations? I can't find any Google advice which is actually helpful.  Thanks!
Hi. I have a routine that triggers the playing of an Internet radio station in the morning on an Echo Show 5. To play this station I need it to play a 'skill' created by that radio station. The problem is that this  then hides the clock and shows the home page for that skill when it is launched.   Is there a way within a routine to tell the echo to show the home screen again once it has triggered the Internet radio skill? I can't figure it out....
"I have two echo dots, one with the clock and one without. The one with the clock stops playing music after approximately one hour. If I ask it like ""Alexa, put some music"" right after that, it say something like ""Alexa stopped playing in advance, because no activity was detected on the device for several hours (pause) ok, I'll put the songs you listened the most."" The strange thing is that it happens only on one device, I already resetted it by long pressing the action button, and eventually Amazon sent me a reconditioned one as a replacement. It still happens on the replacement and I don't know what to do."
Just wondering if I have to install an extra app or what commands to use thank you.
"According to Deal News 2020 blog, [Lorex 1080p HD Smart Indoor Pan/Tilt Wi-Fi Security Camera (works with Alexa)](https://dealnews2020.wordpress.com/2020/07/21/44/) is $15 off with coupon. Is it worth it? What's your view on this security camera? Have you used it?"
"I have a rgb desk lamp and rgb light strips on my desk that is connected to Alexa and I want to say “Alexa, set my battle station to hell mode.” And then have the lamp turn orange and light strips to turn red all at once. Is this possible at all? I know I can tell it to turn specific colors by saying the actual color names like red individually by device but I want to set a fun name to a custom set of colors and have everything change at once. Very specific I know...but just curious haha."
"I would like for Alexa to issue a command to itself at a certain, specifically to use Plex as an alarm clock, but in general, too.  For example, I tell alexa ""Alex, ask plex to play james taylor""  and it does.  But I would like to be able to to do that as a Routine, or similar, but I can't find a way to make the actual command a routine, just ""opening Plex"" at a time.  Is there a way to do this?"
"I have an Echo Show and have connected it with my Insignia FireTV. For the most part Alexa recognizes when I ask her to open the Disney Plus App. The trouble is when I ask her to pull up a specific show, like Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. She will auto default to trying to get me to purchase it through Prime Video instead of opening Disney Plus. I have tried asking her to ""Play Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on Disney Plus,"" but she will only recognize when when I say ""Play Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on FireTV."" My guess is that if I don't specify FireTV then she thinks I am asking her to try to play it on the Echo Show screen.  Is there any way to have Alexa choose to utilize one of my apps instead of giving me purchase options with Prime Video?"
My wife and I sometimes like to turn on some sleep sounds for bed or a nap. We use Sleep Sounds by Sleepjar. When we initially got it the stereo pair in our bedroom worked great but now I can't get it to play on both dots. Music plays in stereo just fine. Any ideas?
We just got an extra echo dot (thanks siriusxm) and I put it in my son's room. So I hooked up freetime. We have a freetime unlimited subscription through the fire tablets already.   What are your kids' favourite ways to use their echo dots?
"Oof I think I’ve gotten myself into a pickle and I can’t seem to ‘undo’ it.    A few weeks ago I sold a Philips Hue Hub. I have used Hue at my old house and at my new home, and from being gifted many sets I had a few extra Hubs (bridges). I sold it as ‘used’ though wasn’t really sure if I’d ever plugged it in.    I currently have my Hue set up and normally use Alexa as my Smart Home Assistant.   Yesterday I was away from home and received notifications from Alexa; “New Hue Device ... Hue White Candle” followed by 10 similar notifications for items I didn’t own.   I checked my Hue app and these ‘new’ items don’t show up in there, but they did appear in my Alexa app. It seems the old Hue Hub is somehow connected to my Alexa account? My Hue app also only shows one Hub, the one I’m currently using.   I’m not sure what I need to do, I’ve tried everything but I can’t actually seem to ‘disconnect the old Hue Hub from Alexa and I’m not sure why. Neither Hub (my current or old) are listed in the ‘devices’ on Alexa.   Everything on the Alexa website says I should be able to delete or disable a Hub from the “devices” screen but ... it’s just not there.  I can delete the individual candles but when I ‘discover’ it just rediscovers them.  _________  Hallelujah! Thank the lord.   I was able to remove the old bridge by logging into meethue.com"

"Hey, I am looking for a way to turn on my lights using a physical button when I dont want to use voice commands. I am using an Echo Plus 2. Gen with TECKIN smart bulbs.   Since my Echo is compatible with Zigbee I tried the IKEA Tradfri dimmer. But Alexa detects the dimmer only as a device without any functions.  Is there a workaround or other compatible buttons that are around 10 € ?"
Anybody have any luck with this? I have Alexa hooked up to spotify. Works perfectly. Just can’t get her to do a song on repeat.   Any help would be much appreciated.
She just looks up penis size statistics. It's obnoxious.
"Second time in the last few days - this afternoon, Alexa suddenly says 'sorry, I don't recognize that device.' I checked my voice history and played back the command. There's a pretty clear woman this time saying 'alexa, show me mom's bedroom.'  No, this wasn't from the TV and I was the only person home. I called Amazon support and the rep had never heard of this this. I did open a ticket with their Echo team, but this is super weird. Has anybody ever had these other voices in their history?"
"From what I've read, the Ring cam that has a motion event doesn't **automatically** bring up the cam display on the Alexa Echo Show-5.  I still have to tell it to ""Show xxx camera"".   The doorbell will automatically display the camera, and it I believe a very desirable feature would be to do the same with camera motion events also."
"TV control. Our cable TV provider offers an Android TV box which has their app preinstalled with it where you can watch VOD and Live TV. So basically I can't control the box with Alexa, except opening apps with voice using the Aberto Sonorus skill. But I still can't turn on/off the box (the TV will be turned on/off with HDMI CEC) with Alexa. Also the built in Chromecast won't work. And also asking Alexa to ""Play something on some streaming service"" won't work. But the most important thing is to turn on/off the box.     I would definetely get a Google Home speaker if it would:  - Have more fun things to do, not only built in games. Alexa has a zillion skills for various things.  - Confirmations. „OOKAY, SETTING THE AIR CONDITIONER TEMPERATURE TO 27 DEGREES."" The worst thing is that you can't turn them off.  - The wake command is longer and harder to say than Alexa  - Custom routines are not available where I live for some reason  Any solutions?"
"Hello all, I'm trying to set Alexa routines to be triggered with sensors (both motion sensors and multi purpose  Door sensors) it worked for the 1st day with ST motion sensor,  But would never work with SmartThings door sensors, so I tried to use Hue motion sensors instead and it worked.  Now 3 days later it stopped working altogether.  I should say that I use both Hue (motion) and Smartthings (motion and multipurpose door) sensors.  In both apps Phillips Hue and Smartthings I can see that the sensors works but it won't work at all with Alexa anymore.   I contacted Amazon's help desk they told me to reset everything and retry again, which I did, and that if the problem persisted to contacts Smartthings but it's clearly Amazon/Alexa's problem.  What should I do?"
"Why is Alexa being a gobby little cunt and not doing what I’m telling it to do, tell it to shuffle my playlist and it will jump between the first 10 songs on repeat when there’s about 200 in the playlist then when I tell it to play a different playlist apparently it doesn’t exist"
"Alexa newbie here.  I want to set a x-minute timer for going-to-sleep music.  But the timer makes a big announcement at the end to let me know it is finished, which wakes me up, defeating the whole purpose.      Is there a way to have a music timer that quietly stops?"
"Anyone else having issues with their Alexa device starting today? We can no longer go to the next or previous song in a playlist, and it just says ""Sorry, I'm not sure how to help you with that."" The only way to change the song is through the app now.  I already tried unplugging it, and resetting the device through the app.  It won't stop playing music either. Just responds ""Sorry, something went wrong."""
"I just got a 3rd generation echo dot and I am trying to connect it to my existing multi room music so it can play music on 3 echo dots. But there is a ""network error"" yet they are all on the same 2g network and not my 5g network. I switch everything over a few times and still nothing what can I do?IDK if this helps but my first 2 dots that are working are a gen 2 and a gen 3 work together fine on multi room."
Before when I was on Spotify and pressed the volume keys on my phone it would change the Dot's volume. When I wasn't on the app it would change phones volume. Now it always changes Dot's volume and I can only change phone volume by closing the Spotify app. Any fix?

"Today a worker at home turned off and on the switch for the lights (all Hue lights), after which they become unresponsive to my Alexa. I tried several times removing the light from my devices list and searching for them again. But it was unsuccessful. - (also after forgetting them, I turned off and on the power switch prior to ""searching for new devices"")   Additionally, I downloaded the Philips Hue BT so I can connect to them and do a factory reset, after which the lights were removed from my hue app (i.e. there was no need to remove them from the Hue app, as it was done automatically). After that, **without** connecting them again to the Hue app, I tried searching for new devices from Alexa, but again it could not control them (i.e. **unresponsive**)."

"When I first got my Amazon Echo I immediately set up every compatible account I had. Among those, my Audible account. After days of not knowing what was going on, it turns out your kindle location needs to be set to the US so you can use Audible with Alexa.  I know, it sounds weird, but there are a lot of other apps that have a Spanish version but are not available in Latin America (at least not in Mexico). I don't know if they have fixed that bug yet, but it sure is annoying, especially because I can't ask Alexa for my ongoing orders (because it looks for my [amazon.us](https://amazon.us) orders)"
"For some reason. my Echo (current gen) volume goes up after turning it down. I play white noise at night (Alexa, play rain sounds) and set the volume to low. Then the next night, or during the next day, it goes up one or two from what I originally set it. I'm the only person in the house. I've tried saying 'volume down one', tapping the physical button, and I believe I've done it in the app, but it keeps creeping up. Is there something I'm missing or another way to do it that would make it stay where I put it??? It's super annoying."

"Does anyone know if Alexa (via echoes or Sonos) is able to do user voice recognition and automatically play music from the correct Spotify account?  Google is able to do this and has for awhile. Alexa seems to have all the basics to do this (including setting up a voice profile) but I can't seem to find how to set to automatically switch (instead of manually switching, which has separate issues).   I know it couldn't in the past but was hoping by now it would (particularly with more people having all family members at home).  Anyone know?"
"I have a Ring Doorbell on the Back Door. I have that doorbell named Back Door in the Ring app and it also shows up as Back Door in the Alexa app. But when the doorbell is rung the announcement from the Echo says ""Someone is at the Front Door"" How can I change this?"

Not even asking me if I **wanted** to rate the item??  Guys..... WAAAAAAY over the line.  I didn't even LOOK yet....  Sure... there may be notification options to tweak this to be gone......... but I can just remove them, and that would fix it too!  DON'T NAG ME BITCH!

"Hi there,  until a month ago I could listen to a podcast on my smartphone and then continue it on my Alexa by just saying ""alexa, spiel spotify"" (alexa, play spotify as I am located in germany).  Now, whenever I try it, Alexa doesn't continue the podcast that I was listening to on my smartphone. Instead it plays random music I was listening to before.

"I have Alex echo flex in my kitchen and put into the group of kitchen with my Philips hue lights. When I say turn on lights, it doesn't turn on the kitchen lights but instead turned on my living room lights. All the time. This bug has been a while. When are you going to fix it?"
Say I ask Alexa to play “Welcome to the Jungle” by Guns N’ Roses. She repeats “Now playing Welcome to the Jungle by Guns N’ Roses on Spotify”... and I miss the epic intro because Alexa feels the need to remind me of what I just asked for while the music plays in the background. This sucks at parties.  Brief mode doesn’t shut this off. I have a Sonos Beam and 2 Sonos One speakers if that matters.
"Recently my Echo Show 8 has had a black screen when playing Spotify on my Everywhere multi room music group. It doesn’t happen when I just play on the echo show by itself.   Also, when I ask Alexa to skip to the next song it just stops playing music altogether on the Everywhere group and the Spotify app no longer functions even though it’s still connected to the group. But if I leave it connected on the app, 20 minutes later it will start randomly playing music again from the Everywhere group.   I have tried unplugging all devices, removing and then adding Spotify back to skills, removing the Show from my account and adding it back, as well as a factory reset. Nothing has solved it.   Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! Thank you for taking the time to read this."

"My echo dot was set up and working for a few days but out of nowhere it started saying it could not connect to the network. I followed the instructions and when I had to connect to a network, I connected to the one that was already saved and it said the WiFi password was incorrect which I’m 100% sure it’s not.

"Alexa thought was taking to her when I wasn’t. She told me she didn’t understand, then the blue ring went back on, indicating she was actively listening. When the blue light turned off, I swear I heard her give a passive aggressive “hmpf!” grunt - like my mom might if she felt slighted."
"I have Arlo cameras connected to our Amazon account and have always been able to pull them up on the Amazon Shows. It has always had about a 50/50 chance of working as Alexa will often say ""Sorry, something went wrong"". I have always been using 1st gen shows. Has anyone does this with later versions of the show and does it work? I wouldn't mind upgrading to a newer generation of Show, but if it doesn't work any better with my Arlo cameras, I don't see much benefit."
"I can't shake the habit of looking over my shoulder at my Echo when I'm ""talking to Alexa"". It's not even to check that it's heard me (via the blue light), but because it seems impolite to shout at someone in the same room without looking at them.  I know on an intellectual level that it hears me regardless, but the cultural or social instinct to look at someone when you're talking to them is very strong!"
"If I have 2 alexa devices (dot, and input connected to speaker) can I play music from spotify through both of them at the same time?"
"I’ve got our Show 8 working fine with my Xbox for turning it on, opening apps, pressing buttons/d pad but now I want to set up a routine in Alexa and can’t figure out how to do what I want.   When I tell it to turn on the Xbox, I want it to then open Hulu, select my (the only one) login account, press up on the d twice, d pad right once (to Live TV) then press A to select live tv. It’s really annoying having to grab the remote to get there or use voice commands so much lol!"
Okay so long story. I used to live with my mom and we shared one Amazon account (mine). She has two Echo Dots that were registered to my Amazon account. I moved out a few months ago and recently she created her own Amazon account and I just shared my Prime benefits with her via Amazon Household. Then I deregistered her Echo Dots from my account and she logged out of the Amazon Shopping and Alexa apps and then logged back in with her Amazon account. Yet every time she sets up one of the Echo Dots it registers to my account anyway. She removed my Amazon account from her phone and everything. What are we doing wrong? All she wants to do it register the Echo Dots to her Amazon account.
"I got these light strips a while ago, set them up and they worked fine. I had to remodel my room so we took them down and back up. Now I ask her to turn them on and she asks if I meant the T.V.. I never set up a T.V so it’s even more confusing"
See the notification light - ask whats the notification and Alexa starts to describe  in detail my purchase LAST MONTH and asking me if I would like to review? WTF? I didn't sign up for  nt like this crap - my purchase isnt a deep dark secret but it isnt like im posting them on a bulletin board for everyone innt on my house to see and comment on. I dropped PRIME last year now IM dropping this Alexa integration with my purchases when I figure out how to do that.
"i bought a $20 merkury inovations wifi camera that stated it could be used with Alexa on the box. i have set the camera up in the Geeni app per the instructions, renamed it, and linked my genni app with the Alexa skill. Still nothing. Has anyone had any luck with this product or app with Alexa? if so then please help."
"but not when I just say ""play song XXX"" it only works if everywhere. is that how its intended to work? you cant use them individually if they're in the multi room group?  she says ""okay, playing.."" but no sound ever comes"
"Ex. If I'm talking to my Kitchen Alexa, I want to say turn on the lights and it knows what to do.  If I'm talking to my gameroom Alexa, same thing.  Can you ""Pair"" a device to a room and specific lights?  Just trying to solve a minor annoyance.  Sometimes Alexa don't hear me, and I have to repeat myself, ""turn on kitchen lights"".  It would also help guests not familiar w/ rooms."
"Here's the second newsletter of July. Highlights this week are from Audible with a new service called Audible Sleep featuring Diddy, Sleep Timers with music, advanced list additions, and a few jokes to wrap things up.

"Alexa asked if she responded from the right speaker, she did, I said ""yes,"" now she responds from the wrong speaker about 50% of the time.  I have a studio directly in front of me about 8 ft.   Now she often responds from the 8"" show in the kitchen around a corner and 25 ft away.  I can't hear what she is saying from that distance, just that she's mumbling something.   POS."
"Hello,  I'm trying to setup a Routine to do the following:  -Set volume to 2  -Play Sleep Sounds  -Wait 1 minute  -Set volume to 1  -Set timer for 29  -Stop audio  1) The 2nd action, ""Play Sleep Sounds"" doesn't work because I'm told that any Skill-based action must be placed at the very end of the Routine. Obviously, this won't work because if I place Play Sleep Sounds as the last step, I won't be able to set my Echo to automatically stop after 30 minutes (1 min initial at volume 2 and the remaining 29 minutes on volume 1). Anyone know a workaround to this?  2) Is there a simpler way to mimic the Alexa action, ""Alexa, set sleep timer for 30 minutes"", instead of what I'm achieving, but using 2 steps (ie Set timer for 29, stop audio). I can't seem to find an action to set a sleep timer within Routine."
"So my parents are older, and now a days are not as tech savvy.  I set them up with some echos throughout their house, which they've quite enjoyed for music, alarms etc.  I set it up on my account, even though it's at their house.  I don't live near my folks, unfortunately, and to go over to there house would require a whole weekend trip.   Recently, they had a new ISP, and as a result switched their modem/router, which resulted in their echos no longer functioning.    Is there any sort of way that I can remedy this and get their devices configured to their new wifi?  Or would it be easier to walk my dad through getting the Alexa app on his phone and then getting him to set up the device himself?   I'd strongly prefer an option that didn't require my dad fiddle with his phone, which is already frustrating for him.  Thanks in advance!"
Everytime I say Alexa to pause the yt video and then say okay it would play the video without sound ( my echo is connected to the fire TV stick). I have to disconnect and reconnect to hear sound again?? Wtf
"I have a TPLink HS105 which is two independent switches each with a lamp plugged in. I grouped the two under a name in Alexa and I can see the two lights under the named group in Alexa. When I voice command the group on, the command fails with Alexa saying there's nothing by that name. If I turn both lights on either though KASA or manually and then use the voice command to turn the group off it works without a problem.  Anyone seen this or have suggestions to fix?"
"Hi y’all, is there a known solution for making Alexa enabled devices come out of my wired ceiling speakers?  So we’re constructing a new home atm and are requesting for for ceiling speakers to be installed at various locations throughout the house. I think it’d be awesome for the house to be a smart house and have Alexa devices like echo dots/echo show throughout the various rooms the when spoken to, will have the audio come from the ceiling speakers.  My question is if there are any suggestions to making the response audio come from those speakers? The speakers are klipsch speakers and I plan on having the wires terminate to my network closet the houses my modem/switch/router/amps/receivers etc.   I’d also like for the different speakers to be confined to the group/room that they’ll live where I want certain commands to come from. (I.e. I’m in the living room and be able to say “Alexa play music in kitchen” and only the kitchen ceiling speakers will play or “Alex play music everywhere” and speakers in all rooms to play.   I’ve seen the Echo link amp and this seems like something I could get to power my speakers but I fully don’t understand how this would work with the dots/show. Also, the amp can only power 1 pair of speakers and I’d like to have at least 3 different groups of speakers.    Note: the house still is able to be prewired so any reasonable suggestions with this can be considered too."
Is it possible to connect and play audio from phone to an echo that is part of a speaker group and have all the speakers play the same audio?
"Hello.   &amp;#x200B;  I bought a FireTV 4K and put it on the living room TV. The old one I had I put it on the Living room TV. Here comes the issue, every command I give Alexa goes to the old one. I created the Spaces in the app, and they work with the plug, the other echo, everything but the FireTVs.   When I tell her to ""turn on Netflix in the living room"" she tells me ""I can't do that on FireTV, would you like me to try on FireTV""...   How can I fix this without deregistering the old FireTV.   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks."
"If I have multiple Alexa devices and I have alarms programmed, will these alarms sound at all the linked devices?"
....
"Is there a different place I can see announcement history? Because an announcement was made at 3am that said, ""they did a murder."" My wife told me about it, I checked my alexa app, and it said that announcement had expired. We have another person that doesn't live in our house that we've allowed to drop in, could that person mistakenly sent an announcement on our alexas?"
"What a night... every single simple thing I've set out to do with the Alexa app on my phone, has found itself thwarted.  How about this one...  I made a simple routine.  I'd like it to adjust the volume of my phone before doing anything (this is a daily ""wake up"" routine for my phone, I don't want it playing on an Amazon device).  The ""Adjust Volume"" action doesn't seem to do anything at all for the phone's volume.  Am I crazy or is there some way to make this work?"
"I was really happy to discover the routines in the Alexa app, and wanted to make one that would say a couple things and then start a playlist.  I use Apple Music, have added it an all that and it works fine over our Echo devices.  But apparently ""Apple Music is not supported..."" on the iPhone Alexa app itself.  Does anyone know if this is ever going to change?  Or if there is in fact some way to make the iOS app able to use Apple Music for alarms and routines etc.?"
"I see that for hardware devices you can select the alert/reminder sound you want.  But for the iOS device itself, this doesn't appear to be possible.  Is there any way to change the sounds used for alarms/reminders/notifications in the iOS app itself?"
"I had a nightly routine set to play classical lullabies at 8pm daily for the past 4-5 months. About a week ago Alexa just says she can’t play that unless i buy a subscription to amazon prime music. So now I’m trying to cancel this 8pm reminder which says “to play classical lullabies automatically every night you must buy a subscription to amazon prime music for $ a month.  How do i turn this off, so i need to reset the echo dot?  Thanks!"
"Hi. I'm using the Alexa App (connected to my Echo Dot) in Brazilian Portuguese and can't find any teams when I go to Settigns - Sports - Add a Team (Tried Corinthians, Real Madrid, Liverpool, New England Patriots, anything). It just appears Select one more teams, but no teams to choose. Any ideas? Maybe this feature isn't available on Brazil?"
"We have a pair of Dots, one in our bedroom and one in the kitchen.  We mostly use them for timers and reminders, or looking up simple things instead of going to a browser.  The problem with the reminders is that they only seem to announce on the device used to create them.  So for example I have a reminder right now to take some medication every 6 hours, but I created it in the kitchen so that's where it announces.  When I'm in the bedroom, there's a very high probability I won't hear it at all.  If I were to create them on the bedroom Dot, then the inverse would be true.  It's a shame she doesn't seem to listen to which room has noise in it currently and announce there.  Or hell, announce everywhere... that would be my personal preference.  Is there any way at all to get her to announce reminders on a specific device?  Or am I stuck just always duplicating reminders to both devices?"
"I have a show, fire TV (named Television) and lights called (lights).   If I ask Alexa to turn on the Television she asks (do you mean TV?)  If I say yes she turns on the television. If I say no she says she can't find a device called television.   If I ask Alexa to turn on the TV she asks (do you mean lights?).   If I ask to turn on the lights there's no issue.   It seems like the phrase TV relates to multiple devices for her. But I can't figure out how to fix it. Changing device names doesn't seem to work.  Anyone know how I can clear out those old device relationships?"
"Hi, all. I have a TCL Roku TV connected with Alexa via a Sonos Beam. I can say ""Alexa, turn off the TV"" and the TV will turn off. However, when I say, ""Alexa, turn on the TV"" she says OK but does not turn on the tv. Saying, ""Alexa, turn on the Roku"" does turn on the TV.  I want to be able to say ""Alexa, turn on the TV"" and it to turn on instead of saying Roku. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance."
"I'm sure this is something stupid I've missed, just got a new ring doorbell which is working fine. I've enable the ring skill, I've authorized access from Alexa to Ring and if I ask Alexa to show me the camera it works fine.  What I'm missing is if I actually ring the doorbell bell I'm not getting any notifications on my show 5. I've enabled the ring camera obviously, motion and door bell press is also enabled.  The show 5 has DnD disabled and communication enabled.  What else am I missing?"
Is there a wireless Alexa? I bought one I thought it was wireless cause it looked wireless on amazon. I didn’t read the details. Are there wireless ones?
"It will be so great if I can use same voice command to control same type of devices in different room. For example, when I am at living room I can simply say ""Alexa turn on/off TV."" When I am at bedroom I can use same voice command ""Alexa turn on/off TV"". I do have Alexa in every single room at my house. It will so convenient, this can apply to same type lights like ceiling light or ceiling fans. They already have the room(zones) it should make sense to add this feature."
"So if I were able to add my Alexa to my iPhone's contacts, I would be able to give it Emergency Bypass, meaning it could make my phone ring even if it was on silent.  That way, whenever I lost my phone and had it on silent, I would able to get Alexa to call it.  Is there anyway I can do this?  Or any other suggestions to accomplish the same goal?"
"Broadlink and Philips Hue?  Hey guys, how are you doing?  Recently I was able to control one IR device over Alexa by using routines on my broadlink. It’s great! However I would really appreciate if using only one voice command, I was also able to set my lights to a specific scene. Is it possible?  More details on what I’m doing (in case it’s necessary) 1- I say “Alexa turn on movie time”, and my electronic screen rolls down and my projector turns on 2- I have philips hue lights and I programmed a scene that I would like to be activated during movie time 3 - ideally speaking, I also would like to turn off the heater and the AC when movie time starts. The AC is connected through Sensibo, and can be accessed through IFTTT and the heater is on a Kasa Smart Plug  Thanks in advance!"
help please!
"My echos lose their WiFi connection all the time, and if there was a powerline adapter built into them, they could easily stay connected by ethernet. Of course, other smart home devices might become disconnected, but at least Alexa would always be online so long as my internet isn't completely out."
"Anyone else getting this kind of new stupidity from Alexa when setting reminders?    *""Alexa, set a reminder.""*  *When should I remind you?*  *""Tuesday at 9 am.""*  *OK, what's the reminder for?*  *""I have a job interview tomorrow at 10:30 am.""*  *OK, reminder set tomorrow for 10:30 am.*  She didn't use to do this but now every time I set a reminder that has a time in it she decides to use the text of the reminder's time instead of the one she just explicitly acknowledged."
"Has the changing the light colour on ambient white bulbs (lights) being removed? Alexa dot recognizes when asked to change to ""warm light in a room"", but there is no option on the mobile app. The mobile app supports only brightness level (off, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) and no colour factor."
Wondering if there are any options to control skylight shades/blinds with Alexa. These shades/blinds can't be easily reached since they are skylights on an elevated ceiling. Thinking I would need to get motorized shades/blinds and would like to have voice command to control or preset times for them to open or close.
"Is there an outdoor Alexa enabled plug that would be okay to get wet with occasional rain or rain spatter? My wife set up deck lights that only turn on and off by unplugging them from an extension cord plugged in outside. I have the TP Kasa outdoor plug that I used in the winter for Xmas lights, but that was just cold, not rain. Any ideas?"
"However, when I put an alarm, I never hear it go off. II’ve only realized it going off because the blue light is circling around like crazy. Then I hear the light sound of the alarm... How do I fix this?"
"I've been getting constant tropical storm warnings over the past day (including a few when I was sleeping, not cool).  Head to the Settings &gt; Notification page on the Alexa App &amp; you'll see ""Severe Weather Alert in \[your town\]"". Disable Repeat, or delete it altogether. I'm not even sure how that got set up in the first place"
I use a Mysa thermostat in my house. My wife likes to leave our windows open in the morning but never shuts them later in the day when it heats up.  Is there a way to create an Alexa alert that the outside temperature has raised above the thermostat ambient (not set) temperature?  It looks like IFTTT might hold the solution but I can’t figure it out. It seems simple enough...
I have an LG Bluetooth speaker and she can't find it. Can she not connect to all Bluetooth speakers? Or are there only certain ones?
"alexa just yelled out, ""woo hoo, 12th man for life!""  ...why"
"So We have an Echo dot in our living room, an echo show in our kitchen, and another Echo dot in our bedroom. The Echo show isn’t a problem because we “renamed” it Echo. The two dots, however, are constantly messing things up. I yell at the dot in the living room (Alexa!) but the dot in the bedroom responds... why can’t I rename one of my dots to prevent this from happening? Or *can* I and I’m just not bright enough to figure it out? lol Please help!! Thanks!!"
"Something changed with the Sleep Sounds skill.  Now it plays 3 notes when you open it, and all the various sounds are different than they were before. We used to like all the various rain sounds and now they are all terrible.  Is there any way to get back the old version, or is there another skill with better sounds?"
I have 3 items in my flash briefing and I can’t change the order. I’ve tried through settings to reorder but it always goes back.  it seems like  flash briefing changed a month or so ago. Any suggestions?
"Hi all,  I came across a previous thread regarding the use of Echo Auto while using Carplay.  Tried to respond but it looks like the thread was closed.   Has anyone been able to make this work? My wife loves her Carplay but wants to have Alexa in her car to use our home automation.  Is it possible to tether her iPhone X to the car for Carplay and simultaneously connect the Echo Auto via Bluetooth? Or am I thinking about this all wrong?"
I have a group with three lights a TV connected to a beam a fire stick and a hue sync box. When I turn it on they all turn on but when I turn them off everything but the lights turn off. I have to turn them off separately. HELP!
"Every time I try to do the Daily Quiz, it now says that I’ve already done the quiz today, come back tomorrow! This has been for about two weeks now. How can I have taken the quiz when I get nothing but a message being told I’ve already taken it?! So frustrating! I am using the Alexa app on iOS."
"I have some smart light switches installed in my house.  Specifically the TP-Link Kasa HS200/HS220.  They seem to work great on their own.  Once they were installed, I downloaded the TP-Link Kasa app on my phone.  I registered them with the Kasa app and have never had a problem with turning them on/off no matter where I am in the world.  The problem is with integration to Alexa.  I go into Alexa, register the TP-Link Kasa skill, discover the devices, and everything works great!  Or, it has worked great up until about a week ago.  Now, Alexa is constantly saying that ""Living room lights is not responding"", ""Dining room lights is not responding"".  This seems to happen randomly for different Kasa switches.  The only way to get them to respond to Alexa commands is to remove and re add them.  Once I re add the ""broken"" ones, after a little bit a few more stop working with Alexa and I need to re add them again.  Which is a pain and totally defeats the purpose of having purchased them anyway, considering 90% of my reason for buying smart switches was to control them with voice commands.  I don't think the problem is with my home network, because the switches ALWAYS respond when sending commands from within the TP-Link Kasa app on my phone.  Whether I am at my house, or out in the world, or on a WiFi network, the Kasa app never fails.  But the link between the Kasa switches and Amazon Alexa seems to be totally unreliable.  For weeks after I installed them, everything was working great.  But as of a couple weeks ago, it's just a mess.  Again, the TP-Link switches always work perfectly when controlled through the Kasa app on my phone, whether I am at home or not.  I also have other non TP-Link smart devices (sockets, bulbs, the Echo units themselves, etc.) which all work perfectly.  When I run a tcpdump from my router, I can see that for the ""broken"" devices, a signal never comes from the Internet to control the smart switch, whereas it does for the other devices that are currently working, some of which are other Kasa devices controlled through the same Alexa skill.  I have tried the following without arriving at a permanent fix:  \-Assigning static DHCP leases to all my devices (just in case)  \-Removing and re adding all of the TP-Link smart switches from Alexa  \-Removing and re adding the TP-Link Kasa Alexa skill  \-Restarting the smart devices  \-Restarting my wireless router  None of these fixes have made any difference.  And, of course, why would they when the problem seems to be related to the Skill link in the cloud between Alexa and TP-Link Kasa.  Can anyone here help me out?"
Any one else think its ridiculous that you cant do this am I not saying the correct phrase ? I'd love to be in the middle of a song in my bedroom then have her play everywhere without having to restart the song.
"So I just saw an announcement that Amazon will be including YTTB, Sling, and a few other ""live TV"" providers into their Live Shows tab on FireTV home.

Anyways I get to the shopping list and notice something different. I had Q-Tips on there but it now says Q-tips Cotton Swabs, Original, 375 Count (Pack of 1).

"I paired my dot with an external bluetooth speaker that I only use in the shower, i would like to set up a chain of events, that's when i turn on the speaker alexa sets her volume to 7 and starts playing music.     Currently I have to tell her (either step by step or via a routine) to set volume and start music, than manually turn on the device so alexa automatically connects to it, but i want the trigger to be manually turning on the bluetooth speaker. I only turn that on if i want music in the shower. Consecventialy, I would like alexa to set volume back to 5 and turn off music if the bluetooth speaker is turned off.      Any ideas?"
"When I ask Alexa the temperature, I want her to announce the outside temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius.  I know I can change the units in the Alexa app but I want to leave that set to Fahrenheit.

"    Hey Guys, thanks a lot to anyone that reads this and offers their opinion 😊      I’m trying to make a decision here and I’m hoping you can help. I want a wireless setup because we like the minimal look in our living room and can’t decide between these packages from Sonos and Amazon.      SONOS    2 x Sonos ONES    1 x Sonos Beam    1 x Sonos Sub = $1900AUD      AMAZON    2 x Amazon Echo 3rd Gen    1 x Amazon Echo Sub. = $600AUD      I’m aware the Sonos setup will sound better, but how much ‘better’? Is the Beam package worth the extra $1300?      I was just going to plug the TV into the amazon echo via 3.5mm.    I want to listen to music and watch HD sports/movies. I like that the Sonos can be mounted on stands. We like alexa and heard the Sonos ONES had poor microphones, however I’m really wondering does anyone have experience with the microphones on the BEAM? Are they better than the frowned upon mic’s in the ONE compared to Echo.      I could also do a pair of Sonos 5’s for $1200 AUD or 2 x Echo Studio’s for $660.      What’s the best value here? Anyone have experience with both products??      Thanks heaps for your help!!"
"I'm trying to connect my echo show to a new wifi network that has a really long password that I'd rather not have to type in manually via the screen.

Is there some other way to set the password that would allow me to copy/paste it?"
"I got a new Echo dot today, and have 2 other Echoes in the house. They can all play my audiobooks apart from this one.

"In the past two months, I’ve had three of my Spots and my Show 5 decide to randomly mute themselves. Well, they aren’t muted, but they don’t make any sound.

It’s anyone else having this issue? I’ve lost faith in them and will no longer be using them as an alarm clock - but hopefully can stop it from happening on other things that I will continue to use."

Has anyone figured this out? Maybe I am over complicating this. Is it possible to build a trigger from IFTTT that only runs when prompted by a routine?"

When I ask Alexa to switch accounts, she says everyone needs to agree to the terms of use. So I go to the Alexa app, as directed, and there are no options for managing household.  Any ideas, people? Thanks!"
I've seen this same ad daily for this show that I have no interest in and it hasn't stopped in about 2 months. How can I tell alexa I am not interested in this ad? Tried going through the settings but I don't know which group it's a part of and I don't want to disable other things that are displayed.  I expect the answer is gonna be suck it up and get over it but I appreciate any help
"July kicks off with a bang (fireworks and all) with this week’s latest Alexa commands. I’m surprised at how many I found to be useful or just simply cool, like with Alexa Messages.   See each of the 20 listed here:  [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-july-6th/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-july-6th/)   Any command categories you’re hoping Amazon would beef up on? For me, Smart Home is still lacking.    P.s. Is weekly too much for these updates? If you guys think I should batch these up into bi-weekly or monthly posts, let me know."
My grandkids love talking to Alexa. I've taught them that she can't understand them if they all yell at once and they do ok with that. But they have a habit of asking her to play Baby Shark anytime I leave the room. And not the real camp song but the horrible kiddie disco version.   I told them that since Alexa knows their voices I can block her from listening to them if they can't behave. They were pretty impressed by that. But can I really have her make sure they have permission to talk to her? She does know their voice profile and recognizes the three of them as one person since they sound similar. It would be awesome if she required verbal permission from Nanny or Grampy before she will do what they ask.
Is there any way to have my fireTV cube answer questions like the weather or turning the lights on/off without it powering on the TV in the processes ? I looked everywhere but can't find it.
"I just set up my echo show 5. I've run in to a couple problems that some may be able to help me out with.  1. I've linked my blink indoor cams to alexa.  In the blink app i can see hear and communicate on the cam, on alexa show I can only see and hear, no communication.  2. I have a roku tv.  I can get alexa to open hulu but that is where it ends. If I say alexa select nothing happens.  So we stay stuck on the profile screen.  If I say ""alexa show me horror movies on hulu.""  It opens horror movies on roku that I can buy.  If hulu is open and I say the command, it closes hulu and goes to the same.  When I said ""alexa play golden girls"" it opened golden girls in hulu, but when I asked to play dark knight returns, it showed me a series of batman videos from youtube  3. Similar but different.  I have the plex server setup.  If I say alexa open plex.  She tries to open it on my cell phone, not on the show 5 screen or on the roku tv.  If I say open plex on the roku, it does, but then any command I try to give has alexa try to open plex on either my phone or a internet browser.  Any help would be appreciated as right now all alexa is to me is an audio light switch."
"I last used Alexa many years ago before switching to Google Home. At the time you still had to say ""Alexa, turn off the kitchen lights"" vs ""Alexa, turn off the lights"" where if you're talking to th kitchen Echo it knows you mean kitchen lights. Just wondering if there has been any changes with that yet or if it's still the same. Thanks!"
"Hey there!  I\`ve been having some issues with my routines/scenes. I use my Echo Dot with some smart lamps(Through the Tuya App) to create a morning routine.   The problem is, these lamps have a really easy factory reset command(switch them on and off twice and that\`s it). And everytime it happens either because myself or a misguided family member couldn\`t get the lights on I have to reconfigure my lamps/scenes and routines. I wish there was a way to backup those settings so I could just restore them after such an event.  &amp;#x200B;  any ideas?"
"Hey guys  I have a strange issue and neither amazon nor extensive googling can fix!  I have got a amazon echo setup - 2x echo studios in stereo pair and a echo sub and the fire tv cube .   Up until a week ago it used to flash up on my tv , Dolby vision and Dolby atmos - so I knew I was getting atmos .. (LG b7)  It now just says Dolby vision , doesn’t output atmos. Not even on the atmos sample it plays when you add the group together it still doesn’t trigger atmos.  Has anyone come across this before , and if so how did you fix it?  Cheers !"
"I've got an echo in every room now and a lot of smart devices such as doorbells, chimes, PIRs, light bulbs, light switches, ceiling fans , door locks, relays and temperature sensors. Most of my devices are Smart Life compatible but some are Ewelink or Ring.   I'm finding the Smart Life app to be the best for home automation. Getting a fan to switch on or speed up depending on temperature is a breeze and PIR sensors bring on my smart lights after sunset when I walk into a room. No problem at all.  However, sometimes I want an Ewelink device to trigger a Smart Life device. This is where I run into problems. I believe that this is possible through IFTTT but none of my Smart Life devices seem to appear in IFTTT after linking the accounts.  The best thing to use would be Alexa routines. However, a device can not trigger a routine. I can turn any device on in a routine but they don't appear under 'When this happens'. Is there a work around for this? Why is this not possible Amazon? It's such an obvious feature which the Smart Life APP can do.  Another missing feature. The smart life app can use multiple triggers set as 'any condition is met' or 'all conditions are met'. When is Amazon going to catch up with making their routines more advanced?"
"I already have a Spotify account connected to my Alexa.  If I'll extend my plan to Spotify Premium Duo, which allows connecting 2 Spotify accounts, would Alexa be familiar with both accounts and their playlists?   Should something special be done besides connecting to Duo account owner to be the Alexa Spotify Account, like referring to specific account by name or something?"
"I got an echo show recently and installed it as a bed side alarm clock.   I've noticed at night it would randomly light up by itself, show my custom picture and then go back go back to night mode but it's bright enough to light up the bed.  Is this a common issue or is there something I need to switch off?  If it helps I'm in the UK."
I live in Guatemala and I want to be able to use Spotify with my Alexa but I have issues due to this skill is not accessible in my area. I have tried spoofing my device location and changing the location of both my account and device to the US. I have yet to see any results and was wondering if there was a workaround to get this to work.
Is it possible to have multiple homes like for Ring or Nest?
"I know Alexa gives us some of the easter eggs if we ask, 'Alexa, give me an easter egg'. But even though Alexa has 250+ easter eggs hidden, we always get the same ones. So we decided to create a skill for the most comprehensive collection of easter eggs (still adding more as we find it). If you are bored at home during this quarantine time, you can try this skill. Please let us know the feedback if you try it :)  Here are the links to Alexa store:  US: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C9KZNBH](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C9KZNBH)  UK: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08C9KZNBH](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08C9KZNBH)  India: [https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08C9KZNBH](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08C9KZNBH)  Canada: [https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08C9KZNBH](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08C9KZNBH)  Australia: [https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08C9KZNBH](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08C9KZNBH)"
"It was working fine until a few weeks ago.  I have restarted my phone (Galaxy S9+) and reinstalled the app.  Still the problem persists.  It works on my echo devices at home, just not on my phone."
Over the past week I have 2 echo dots that no longer connect to my WiFi. Both have historically worked for around 2 years.  Super frustrating as I’ve tried the following with no luck: -unplugged echo dots and replugged in -rebooted router -attempted to connect to secondary WiFi signal (have a mesh router and can tell it to send a separate ssid) -moved the dots to a different area and rebooted where they did connect to my network and then moved them back to their original location where they eventually disconnect again. -checked WiFi range and signal (both dots are within 20 feet of the router and our mesh access point)  My last effort will be doing a factory reset.
"Hi all, recently new to this whole alexa stuff and was wondering if I could lean on your skills and experience.  Have purchased a cube as stock was old. Now it has voice recognition with alexa. However when searching for the office US which I know is a prime show. Alexa always responds with ""getting the office from netflix"". Please note this is in my recents as well.   I don't have a Netflix account how do I disable this and why is it not prioritising prime shows first. Is there a setting I can turn on/off to stop this. I have consulted the app but I am unable to see anywhere that netflix is even mentioned.  Many thanks."
I bought a 2nd generation fires tick and 2 3rd generation Alexa. Is it possible to make the Alexa play contemporaneously the audio the fire stick is providing?
"In the past week my echo stopped turning my hue lights off with voice comands, I opened the app and the echo can't find the hue light - I removed the original light and tried repairing It by pressing the hue bridge button method but it still didn't find the hue bridge"
"This has been going on for a while, a few weeks ago it started happening but eventually it started working again, but now it just doesn't work. I would plug it in, but it wouldn't boot up and none of the buttons worked except the mute button, which only lights up the button, not the entire device. Yes, I've tried saying ""unmute"", I've tried holding down the command button and volume button. I've tried about everything. The Alexa is obviously getting power as the mute button still lights up so it's not a power problem. I know this is a very specific problem, but I'm just wondering if this has happened to anyone, and if so what I should do."
Everytime I ask her to play something she starts playing in random order. That ruins the experience of some artists - like Pink Floyd.
"Recently my Amazon Echo has started playing more songs similar to my requested song. This feature is nice and all sometimes, but frequently it's just annoying as I just wanted to listen to the one song.  Does anyone know how to disable it?  Thanks in advance!"

"I scanned for devices lately because I added a new smart plug and Alexa app discovered my printer in the home office upstairs. It then told me that this printer is controlled by an echo flex (which I do own) but it’s located in my garage. Why in hell I’d ever want to print from my garage is beyond me. But this does have some appeal if I can use Alexa to request a print out of a shopping list or a to do list. Currently it won’t work at all because the printer has to be on a 2.4 MHz WiFi and the rest of the house uses the 5 MHz band.   I deleted the printer as a device since it’s basically useless. No one is going to go to the garage to tell Alexa to print a grocery list and then climb up to the second floor to retrieve it. Does anyone know how to make this work with any other device? Theoretically I could put the flex upstairs in my office but it work well where it is, plugged into the wall adjacent to the door where it functions as a night light as well."
"I have two Alexa devices in my home. One is a thermostat near the kitchen. It tells me how much 1/4 cup of crushed walnuts weighs, and does kitchen timers.   The dot is in the computer room, and is plugged into the aux port of my multiroom sound system.  When I ask the thermostat to play music, I have to string together clauses, ""Play The Final Countdown on Amazon Music on the Echo Dot.""  Can I teach the thermostat echo that all entertainment skills should default to the multimedia device?"
Sometimes my reminders stay ”this is a reminder for you” [emphasis on you] and sometimes it stays ”here is your reminder”. It seems to switch at random. Does anyone know why?
I’m not very tech literate and I’m not finding Alexa very useful at this time.   I would love for Alexa to actually STFU when I tell her to in the morning for the alarm. I would also like her to check on me to make sure I actually woke up (😂😂😂).  I would also like simple reminders of where I put things (husband has early onset dementia and I think it could help him).  Can someone guide me how to find these skills and activate them? And what are your must haves/most frequently used ones?
"I have several my google calendars linked to my Alexa app. I created a new one yesterday and it won’t show up on the app, even though all others do.  I’ve tried force closing the apps and restarting, and I even tried unlinking my entire account but it still isn’t there, even though my other ones are.  Advice?"
I have an iPhone XR updated to the newest version is there anyway to send text messages to others from her?
"Lately Alexa has been defaulting music and radio station commands to my Xbox instead of the device where I am making the request. Instead of playing the radio station or song from Spotify on the Echo or Dot, she tries to open it on my Xbox even though Spotify is not installed on it. This only happens when the console is on, so I'm wondering if the issue is with Alexa or the Xbox skill.   Curious if there is any solution to this other than removing the Xbox skill which I do find useful for other functions."
"Is there a way to get Alexa to turn off a nest thermostat if it hears a fire alarm going off? I looked through ifttt, but I don’t see any Alexa guard triggers?"
Alexa cancel my 8:10 am reminder  you have nothing on your calendar for 8:10 am  Alexa what are my reminders?  you have a reminder at 8:10 am  Alexa cancel my 8:10 am reminder  you have nothing on your calendar for 8:10 am  Alexa what's on my calendar today  you have a reminder at 8:10 am......  :(
Every few hours Alexa says its time to walk or stretch or states random facts. It's super annoying and I can't figure out what the features called or how to turn it off. Please help!!!
"Like holy fuck this is so frustrating, I'll say play the song pumped up kicks by foster the people and it will say ""playing pumped up kicks radio"" it's so annoying, I wanna play a single song not radio. It never even plays the right song either, cause its playing off a radio. I don't have spotify Premium"
"Recently purchased some new GE appliances and among the features I liked was integration with Alexa through the “Geneva” skill. I was unable to locate it on the Canadian skill list but upon searching there it is on the US site for American users. Called the folks at GE who swore up and down it was available in Canada, that was until they went and looked and were left baffled as to why not. They say it’s an Amazon issue, should I just contact tech support for Amazon or is there a specific place I can connect to request a skill."
"I know the Look was not a popular device, so I’m not sure many people are interested in its capabilities. We have Alexa devices all over the house, but the Look has never been used for anything but taking closet pics. I have never cared about any of the connected features or wardrobe “advice” it offered...but somethjng about the lights and camera is magic. It takes the best pictures.   So they are discontinuing the Look, and this month, all devices will entirely cease to function. But there’s obviously a functional camera and lights still in there, so I imagine there must be a way theoretically to continue to use it in that way. The only way I currently know to make it take a picture is through an Alexa voice command, and viewing the pictures can only be done through the app. Does anyone know of any way to possibly circumvent this?"
"I purchased new TV and connected it Amazon alexa. I double checked that it's connected being it's showing up on Amazon alexa . When I did initial test Alexa worked fine, however after initial test it's no longer answering. Anyone seen such issue? It do not seem like skills need to be enabled being Alexa is built in, so what could be the issue?"
We use Echo units all over our home including in the room we rent out. Since they don't need to know when we get shipments I wanted to see if there was a way to have any shipping notifications go to JUST the unit in our bedroom?
"About to do an Alexa hackathon, are there any Alexa skills that my team could create that would make your life easier? I don't have an Alexa device, so I can't tell what skills it doesn't have."
Is it possible to have managing multiple homes like for Ring or Nest?
"Hello,  I've recently set Alexa up to control the Xbox, she manages to turn it on and off fine and launch games / Netflix no problem.   However when it come to launching prime video she tries to launch Prime US app, I'm in the UK so obviously this doesn't work. Prime works fine normally on the Xbox but Alexa doesn't seem to recognise the UK version of the app. Anyone else seen this problem?  Thanks"
I know the Alexa will record your voice when you’re setting the alarm but is there a way to have it record in the morning when the alarm is ringing and I tell the Alexa to stop? I’m curious because sometimes I don’t remember turning the alarm off and it would be funny to see
"Hi guys,  So I've been having trouble reaching Alexa Customer Support and figured I'd ask here:  With my Echo, I'm able to control two Wyze bulbs and a Samsung smart TV (via Smart Things) with my voice. Recently, I attempted to create two routines: one that would turn on all three (""Alexa, welcome me home"") and one that would turn off all three (""Alexa, good night""). These routines work when I hit the play button in the app, but when I attempt to activate them by voice, nothing happens. Does anyone have any insight into this? Is it because my TV only connects via Smart Things? I'm at a loss.  Thanks!"
"We have an echo dot and an echo plus, both under the same Amazon account, but at separate locations. The problem is when I connect my Spotify to the echo dot, it also connected to the echo plus. I’ve tried to “forget” the plus in Spotify but it keeps reconnecting. Any ideas how to fix this?"
"Does anyone know of a product that can automate opening and closing of windows that lift via Alexa? Not looking for blinds/shades to be automated, but the actual windows themselves."
"About 10 minutes ago, it picked up a voice clearly saying ""Who is Jeff Bezos"" and it responded accordingly, problem is: no one in the house said it! I listened to the voice history, and the voice who said it sounds like one of those text to speech voices, but all of my devices had their volume turned off, so there's no way it accidentally came out from one of them; also my TV was turned off."
 how do I set a timer with a [***tibetan*** bell](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03nA6n4lorSBk0kOcOIsFCmCL5ODQ:1593574208900&amp;q=tibetan+bell&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzzpPFjqvqAhXB3J4KHUYZBCUQkeECKAB6BAgPECc) sound at end
"This is interesting, about 4 weeks ago, while I was out of town, I received 3 notices that my echo dots, 3 different dots, received a sound  possible smoke detector sound. I have Ring alarm and that smoke detector did not activate.   Today, I got the same message from my 4 echo dots and my echo spot. Again, Ring alarm was not activated.   Both times, I dropped in on my echo spot, and no smoke.   We have a chimney, so I thought maybe a gust of wind blew in some smoke smell. Again, both times there were no gusts at the time and normal wind direction out of the west, I also have a weather station on site.   I listened to the alerts and they were all definite smoke alarm sounds. The sounds were not beeps like you get with a dying battery.   Any one else ever had this?  I do not feel that Guard has a problem, but it is confusing on why it is happening."
"Hey all,  My mom passed away in December leaving my step-dad all alone in his house, two hours away from me, during this lockdown. I stay in touch with him all the time, but I’m trying to find other ways we can stay connected over shared interests.   We both like similar movies and tv shows and I have previously set him up on my Apple family to be able to watch my purchases on iTunes. He has a fire cube hooked up to his tv with Alexa built in.  He’s in his 70s and even though we’ve gone through the steps to get to the Apple TV app and browse my library of movies and shows I think it’s still too cumbersome for him to remember and go through on his own.   I’m curious if he could simply say “Alexa, watch Oceans Eleven on Apple TV” if it would go straight to just playing the movie from my library.   His tv does automatically switch inputs to the fire cube when using voice activation, but once he’s at the home screen he just gets a little lost.  Thanks"
"June's done! Collectively, there are 102 total command to try out. While that number alone may sound daunting, I’ve compiled a few of my favorite commands in the below roundup.

"I got a couple echos yesterday as a promo and Im trying to change the default news source. Currently if I ask “play the news” it plays fox news. I dont have fox news as a skill or anything.   In flash briefings I only have reuters. If I say “play flash briefing”, reuters plays.   What am I missing?"
"I have an Echo setup for my elderly mother and it's been a lifesaver. One of the many things Alexa does for her is to remind her to take her medicine at the same time each day. The only problem with that is that she may not be in the room to hear it at that exact moment. Is there any way to have Alexa confirm that she took her pills and, if not, remind her again in say 10 minutes?"
Looking to hoard all your good ideas for myself! LOL.   What is your: - Favorite routine or automation you’ve setup? - Most used? - The one you can’t wait to show people? - The one that’s not very cool but would be super frustrating if it stopped working? - Got anything for pets? (Dogs and aquariums here.)  Let me know if I missed anything! I love hearing about all the cool things you guys setup!
"When I bough my echo dot the led ring was always on, then I saw that enabling “don’t disturb mode” you can turn it off. Now I’ve changed the location of the echo dot and I want the led to be always on like when I bough it, but disabling “don’t disturb mode” doesn’t make it light again, what can I do to make the led ring be always on again?"
I know this is possible through creating your own skill with a developer account (which I have) .but my question is does anyone know if the is any source code to go off of because I can’t find anything that works. I just don’t wanna waist all my time doing it from scratch.
"The functionality with Alexa seems better than Echo Auto, oddly enough. However...I have a hard time believing they couldn’t have made the legs thinner. I do enjoy confusing the hell out of people while talking on the phone in public, and the response is pretty solid with Alexa. I’ve only used them for two full days, so it’s to be determined if they hold up.  I’m particularly concerned about their hardiness in the rain."
Ps4 doesnt support bluetooth  and I've read somehow  you can get the sound to be output through alexa bluetooth . Does anyone know how to do this?
"I have an ecobee thermostat with multiple temperature/motion sensors. For almost a year now, I've been able to ask her ""what's the temperature of the bedroom"" and she'd say,"" ok, getting ecobee +. The bedroom temperature is blah"" As of today, she now replies with ""I found more than one device with the name ""bedroom""."" What's odd is that I have another 4-in-1 sensor by inovelli, via Z-Wave (SmartThings) and I don't have this issue.  I do in fact show each ecobee sensor I have, one acting as a thermometer and one as a motion sensor. I could just rename it in Alexa, but that breaks the consistency I have.  The only thing that has changed in my environment the past month has been I noticed one of my echo shows received an update last night. Prior to that, I installed a new Z-Wave switch via SmartThings and ran a device discovery, so it wouldn't be a delay.   Has anyone else experienced this?"
"Over the last few weeks my Alexa system has gone off the rails. If I tell her to stop playing music or reading a book she doesn’t listen. Or, she’ll stop playing in some rooms but not others.  When she won’t stop playing even the Alexa app won’t stop it.   I’ll tell her to turn off the bedroom lights and she’ll change the light on my router. Or, I’ll tell her to turn off the living room lights and she’ll tell me she couldn’t find any devices named living room.   This happens with all of my echos, and everything has worked flawlessly for almost a year. Then, all at once these things started happening. It’s a crapshoot as to whether she’ll do what I ask. Anyone else have this issue?  Is there a fix?"
"I ran into an issue with TuneIn recently (a variant on the usual ""there's similarly named stations and Alexa refuses to play the one I want"") and it occurred to me that if TuneIn would assign a unique numeric ID to each station as an alternative way of specifying the station, it would provide a workaround for all of these type of cases.  I contacted TuneIn support and got a CSR who replied to every email very quickly but I could not explain myself well enough to get anything but a ""I'm sorry, we can't change the name of a station for you. The station would have to request that change.""  I tried contacting Amazon support (since TuneIn integration is built into the product), but they said ""contact TuneIn support"".  So I'm looking for a better way to get the feature request to TuneIn's dev team. Any of you happen to have any suggestions?"
"Yes I said that right. I need a Jarvis. Lot's of you probably have thought of this before as well. I thought of this, and gave up on it a little while ago, as I realized that this may be difficult to create. I have an Alexa in my room, but inside of the Alexa app on my iPhone, you are only allowed to change her name to ""Computer"" ""Echo"" ""Amazon"" or keep it as ""Alexa"". This made me feel like I may need to actually program a software from scratch, with the wake work as Jarvis, or have to go inside of the software of Alexa and manually change her name.  I thought this, until I finally had a bright idea: Hardware. Let me elaborate. On the outside of the Echo Dot, there's a dot button. Pressing this dot button manually wakes up Alexa without having to say her name. Taking advantage of this feature means that I can simply program a robot to activate upon the word Jarvis, and it will click that button. This allows me to essentially wake up Alexa by saying Jarvis, and provides to me all of the benefits of having Alexa - I get Jarvis pre-programmed by Amazon!  \\Now that we've got the ""what"" out of the way, I need to figure out the ""how"". I have no idea how to program a robot to click a button. If anybody either knows a simple way to make this small robot, or has a new and/or more effective way to achieve the goal of having a Jarvis, please drop your ideas down below. Anything and everything helps!"
"Hi,  So I've had Alexa and an Echo Dot 3 for 6 months more or less. Everything was great up until last month.   I had set up a routine to turn on some lights at sunset and another one again at sunrise. I deleted both of these routines but they are somehow still operating everyday.  Now my Alexa app doesn't list these routines anymore, nor does the Philips Hue app. I did a reset on the Echo Dot 3 but to no avail.  What should I do to actually delete those routines?  Thanks"
"I’ve tried adding a voice code as well as toggling off voice purchasing entirely. I power cycled the dot after making the changes in the app. Then I ask to purchase something and in both cases it will add the item to my cart. It then asks me to confirm the purchase by simply saying “buy it now.” Is something wrong here, or will there be an additional step prior to the purchase going through? I don’t feel like testing this and having to cancel a test purchase."

"My overhead garage door opener has gone out. Since I have an opportunity to replace it with a smart-enabled overhead, I figured I may as well take advantage. I'm really wanting one that is compatible with Alexa and I've heard several are not. I'd rather not get a regular garage door and then purchase a smart-enabled controller separately.

"Good morning.  New to Alexa, and hoping it can help me with home, since I work from home three days a week, currently.  I need to set a reminder for one of my children, to go off every hour, on the house, from 7:00am to 7:00pm, Thursday through Sunday and then the same reminder to occur from 5:00pm to 7:00pm Monday through Wednesday.  The reason for this is that I work from home Monday through Wednesday, and my child is at my in-laws house during this period, and I'd rather not have Alexa yelling it at me while I'm on a call.  I've tried a few different options and, aside from setting an individual reminder for each reminder 7:00am through 4:00pm on Thursdays through Sundays, I'm coming up at a loss.  Can anyone assist me with this?  Thanks!"
"This week we have an interesting mix of commands. We get a few cool, quirky, and even rotten commands.

With this being the last newsletter of June, do you have a favorite command from this month? Don’t keep it to yourself! Throw a comment up and let’s compare."
"My roommate claims that he asked Alexa, how do you murder someone ? And she responded in grave detail, how one would go about murdering another human, specifically the usage of snowballs. He’s since disconnected all devices. Has anyone else experience this ? Plz help."
"The Echo Flex launched with a light and motion sensor accessory by ""Third Reality"", the only Amazon partner to be granted access to the hardware interface API. I've been googling for a while now as I really want to build my own hardware for personal use that integrates with the Flex, saving me from needing wireless communications on board. I'm unable to find anything except a couple threads where others asked for more information about it and were ignored by Amazon. The Flex has been out for 8 months and no new accessories or interface API have been released. Is this product abandoned?"
"""Alexa, I've put my red jacket in the storage container in the spare room.""  Months later.  ""Alexa, Where is my red jacket?""  ""You'll find your red jacket in the storage container in the spare room.""  Make this happen."
"Super weird  I had a hard time believing my kids when they told me, but I was able to replicate it on each of our devices. When we ask this specific question:  ""Alexa, who is your favorite player in the NFL?""   A male voice answers!  Every other question we ask gets answered with the standard female voice.  We made no changes to the voice settings.   Please try it out and let me know if you experience the same thing.  Or if you have had this happen before."
"Hey! Would appreciate some help here.   My Spotify is connected to Alexa and I routinely play specific playlists. I recently created a new playlist on Spotify and Alexa is ""unable to find it"". I tried changing names of the playlist, but it still cannot find it. I don't know if it is related, but when I go to add songs to spotify playlists on Shazam, the new playlist doesn't show up either.  Thanks!"
"So, I ran into this problem myself today, and the obvious Google searches yielded a bunch of threads where people have had the same issue but nobody has shared a viable solution. Well, that changes now. While you can't disable Guard within a Routine, you can trigger a Routine by disabling Guard...   The default voice command for this is ""Alexa, I'm home."" I didn't know this when I created my custom 'I'm Home' routine and, as a result, my departure routine could arm Guard but my return routine was preempting the default behavior.  **The solution** was to change the trigger for my arrival from Voice&gt;""I'm home"" to Guard&gt;Home. Now my same trigger words (""I'm home"") will do both, set Guard to 'Home' *and* turn on my lights, adjust start devices, or whatever else is in the routine."
"Hello everyone. (I’m not sure if this has been asked yet or not but I’m new to this sub) I recently got an echo dot, and I use a lot of routines. On the Alexa app, it only allows music to be played from one speaker or the other. Is there a way to have a routine play music from all speakers?"
The only thing I have not tried is removing app and reloading...
Basically allows you to: Close focused window Close all windows Shut down Sleep Restart Press enter/space/tab  Would be very handy for me ngl
"I'd like for it to be part of the display, either at all times or by cycling through like the news and headlines do."
Maybe it's my (Scottish) accent. But imho it's a much better name!
"I just got alexa, but I realised it doesn't support YouTube music or YouTube in general.  I just want to know why, considering YouTube is a major platform"
Is their a Spanish language lesson Alexa Skill?
"Hey guys!  My title is self-explanatory, but I was wondering what is the reason behind the fact that we are unable to use the service YouTube Music from Alexa?  I am guessing that it has something to do with the love between Google and Amazon.   I hope that one day I will be able to use my YouTube Music service on my Alexa!   Thanks guys for your answer!"
"I recently got an Echo Dot 3 and have the Amazon Alexa app. Tried following the instructions and bunch of youtube videos but it seems to just not connect to my wifi. I have no problems with other devices connecting to the wifi.  After the app says that Echo Dot is now connected, few seconds later the device itself says that it is not connected to wifi. I’ve noticed it does not show up under ‘Devices’ as well and no option to use it as speaker.  I’ve also tried to register via alexa.amazon.com and still getting errors. Restarted router, deleted and reinstalled the app, deregistered the device on amazon.com, still nothing works. Hope someone can enlighten, thanks!"
"I'm looking into getting an Alexa and in the videos I've watched they showcase the whisper function, but whenever they do Alexa says something along the lines of ""I've detected that you are whispering to me, from now on I will whisper back."" at a normal volume. Does it do that every time?"
Every night we use Alexa for bedtime stories and sleep sounds for my kid. Lately we go through the Command process and Alexa says “ok” but then doesn’t follow through. With sleep sounds she’ll ask which one but once we answer she goes silent.
"She use to play now she keeps playing ""the daily intro"". I tried a variety of combination of the words in the title."
Do Alexa routines that are scheduled (ie: turn on a smart plug at 0600) require an Alexa to be powered or are they run from somewhere on the internet..?
What is the save code! Please!!!
This Alexa command has worked perfectly until last week when it stopped executing. No errors are given. Chamberlain b970 opener connected via Wi-Fi and simple commands app. Any suggestions?

Ok so I got a alexa yesterday and linked my spotify account to it but when I ask to alexa to play a specific song it plays a completely different song and it annoying any help?
"Hi guys, is there a way to get the alexa to play custom sounds in routines without the use of a computer? Maybe some sort of cloud based soundbite?"
"I have a routine of waking up to the radio (I use TuneIn app) and happens every day. After a while, the emission goes back to where it was some minutes before. Has this happened to anyone else? It's very annoying."
"Hello everyone.  One day Alexa randomly mentioned that it can give you reminders throughout the day to drink water, take breaks, etc, and asked if we'd like to try it.   I said yes.  It doesn't align at all with my schedule and I'd like to knowif I can configure the feature at all and likely just turn it off altogether.     I checked my reminders section on the phone app and the skills section and tried a few voice commands to try to get it to stop.  What is this feature called and what can I do about it?"
"Listening to radio.  Decided to ask Alexa something  ""Alexa...""  then changed my mind and said  "".. nothing""  ..  Alexa then says ""Goodbye"" and the radio mutes and turns off.  Then everytime I try to start the radio again.. it started muted then switches off again.  Wifi was OK.  Volume was OK.  Couldn't figure it out at all.  Had to reset in the end and its fine now. Any idea what I/she'd done ???"
"Hi, is there any way to disable Alexa from displaying a router log in screen?  Every night I have my router reboot around 3am, I don't really want Alexa to show this.  Thanks."
"The speaker group volume bug is one thing, but they're completely thrown on why deregistering and factory resetting isn't taking. It disconnects, but when I add a back to my account it knows exactly who it is."
"When I ask, I am just booted to the home screen."
"I had asked my echo to remind me nightly at 9pm to take a medication I was prescribed, and I'm no longer taking it. Checked in my app and there are no reminders set. I've asked her to repeat past reminders (to see if maybe she'll let me delete them that way) but she says there are no, and have never been, any reminders set. Lord help me before I chuck this thing out a window, because I can't seem to find anything online about this."
"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/hfny02/cant_play_spotify_anymore_through_voice_command/)  Well, it looks like I can play playlists through voice command on my echo dot...sort of. At first, Alexa had no problem playing my ""liked"" songs on spotify. This is the list spotify automatically makes and adds to when you ""heart"" a song. Starting today, it could no longer play my ""liked"" songs.   However, it CAN play my ""good songs"" playlist that I manually created. It also plays the ""my shazam tracks"" playlist that gets created automatically when you use the shazam app to identify music.  But for some reason, it decided to no longer  wants to play the ""liked"" songs playlist. No matter which way I ask....it just doesnt work. It worked flawlessly for the first week or so."
"I used to say, “Alexa, play Ozark”, and it would automatically open the last episode where I left off on my TV an start playing.   But now, it searches for the title in Netflix and shows the results as thumbnails.   I need to find the remote and manually select the title before it will start playing.    I loved the previous setup.  Did something change?   It’s like this for all content.  How do I get it to auto play again?  Thanks."
"Yesterday I was watching YouTube videos on my echo show and it worked just fine, but I just tried to it today and it won't open at all. Everything else is fine, I can still ask for weather and such, but it won't respond to my request to play youtube videos. Is this a problem for other people with echo shows? The command I used to use was ""alexa, open youtube"" but it doesn't seem to work anymore."
"I like listening to music, and one of my personal favorite artists has an odd name, as many tend to do nowadays. In this particular instance, the artist’s name is “FabvL,” pronounced “Fable.” But whenever I try to get Alexa to play a song, I have to say “Fab-v-l (fab vee el). Is there anything I can do in the app to correct this and any other odd artist names I happen to stumble across?"
"Hello, this may sound confusing but I was looking for a way that my led light strips would turn on when Alexa is triggered and then off when she finishes saying her thing. Basically I want to hid my Alexa behind a tv and when I say Alexa the led light strips turn on indicating that she is now listening to me. I was wondering how I would be able to do that?"
"It's really pissing me off and Amazon chat is acting like it's not suppose to do that.   Is there a way to disable this ""feature?"""
"Used to I could say ""Alexa, volume 3 every where"" to one of my echo dots and the other 2 dots in the every where group's volumes would change to 3. Now when I say it to Alexa, the volume of the dot I'm speaking to changes and nothing else. Naming individual speakers still works. I can tell my living room speaker ""volume 3 bedroom speaker"" and the bedroom speaker's volume changes. It's just speaker *group* volume control that's broken. And yeah the group is intact - they're all on the same wifi and everything. I can tell Alexa ""play Spotify every where"" and she does it. It's just volume that's broken."
"I have paid Spotify account.  I got an echo dot with clock last week. Everything was going great until now. When I say, ""Alexa, play my liked songs from spotify"".   Alexa says, ""I am having trouble playing from spotify, please try again"".   I've reset my echo dot, I have disabled and re-enabled my Spotify skill. Nothing works."
I recently got an echo dot as a gift and I've never had one before so I'm new to this and I was wondering if i could set this up to control my soundbar and if i can how would i go about setting it up?  I have a taotronics soundbar connected to my tv this is the soundbar i have here[Taotronics Soundbar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KZ7MVS2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_kbj9Eb91Y4W5S) i have it connected to my tv through an aux set up since my tv is a little older and the optical port acts funny sometimes. My soundbar can connect to Bluetooth but if i do that it wouldn't be connected to my tv anymore.  I'm happy enough that the echo dot can control my firestick i just thought it would be pretty convenient to just have it also able to control my soundbar but i dont see how i can do that without loosing it being connected to the tv.   Sorry if this is a stupid question like i said I've never had an alexa device and I'm just trying to figure out what it can do and enjoy it.  Thank you for any help!
"So let me start by saying this is in no way a paid post or advertisement, its 100% made of my own will because this site and the 3 guys who run it are just that absurdly amazing i owe it to them to try and spread the word a bit  &amp;#x200B;  So this website [https://creator.voiceflow.com/](https://creator.voiceflow.com/) is by far the greatest creation known to man in terms of Alexa skill building. It allows anyone, regardless of how much knowledge of code they may or may not have, make comprehensive complex and in depth skills for Alexa.  &amp;#x200B;  It achieves this by making a majority of the tedious (to me mind boggling) coding language a thing of the past and puts everything you need into a DIY drag and drop template profile creator (kind of like Amazon's own but EVEN better and more direct)  &amp;#x200B;  I know absolutely NOTHING about coding (not for a lack of trying mind you) and ive created things such as this [https://creator.voiceflow.com/demo/462855662848467](https://creator.voiceflow.com/demo/462855662848467) which is the Federal News Network from Starship Troopers (Would you like to know more?)

"When I say, ""Alexa, I'm home"", Alexa responds with ""Welcome home, master"" - turning everything *on* that should come on when I come home. Since nothing *else* is ever going to get turned on for me, it's nice to have something that *does*.   I was also thinking of maybe changing the phrase to ""Alexa, daddy's home"", but since I say this in a loud clear voice at the door to my apartment, it seemed like a bad idea. Then again, why stop at a single bad idea?  *Alexa, who's your sugar daddy?*  You can totally customize the responses, why not be creative? Smart does not have to be dull. I hope that this little bit of fun both inspired and amused."
"Hey guys,   I have a few alexas around the house and one has started playing up, It can no longer find any smart home devices.  In the app the problem alexa speaker is all set up correctly, just like the other working alexas, I can add a device to the same group as the problem alexa but it cannot find any devices. I have deleted/readded the problem alexa but nothing has fixed it.   Any ideas?"
"I wake up at different times every day so I am unable to set a Alexa/Hue wakeup sunrise routine for the same time every day.  Is there any way to create a sunrise wakeup routine, lets say I name it ""Start my day"", and just say ""Alexa, start my day tomorrow at 8am"" ?"
"I subscribe to Hulu Plus, which has required 90-second commercials. While the commercials are running and muted, can anyone recommend useful/fun Alexa requests that will be finished in less than 90 seconds?

"I fear the answer is no but haven’t been able to confirm or deny with my googling...  I have two old iPhones mounted on the walls next to my exterior doors as HomeKit control panels. I would like the screens to be on from the first time I use them until I go to bed which is obviously power intensive but will make interactions quicker. The phones are locked in guided access to prevent other features being used. I have seen others link up a smart plug with a charger to trickle charge on a schedule and wondered if this could be achieved with an Echo Flex? Or is the usb output ‘dumb’ and just provides constant power?  In an ideal world, the charger would be triggered on the battery status until a designated level was reached but let’s not get too hasty!"

This happens on Netflix, Prime Video, Youtube, etc. The fire stick is correctly linked to my amazon account as well as to my echo, so I don't think thats the problem. I can even pause and resume episodes once I'm in, so it's really weird.   Any ideas?"

"I don’t know if it’s an Alexa change or something specific to NPR, but ever since I was asked for my ZIP code a few days ago, my flash briefing from NPR (the first entry) has rattled on for 10+ minutes. No clue how long it really is, as I’ve ended up stopping it before it ever even gets to the second subscription on my flash briefing.   I haven’t  changed anything else about my briefing and still see the same 3 entries in my profile page. I also haven’t changed the way I ask for it “Alexa, what’s my news?”   I’m wondering if that’s what changed on Alexa’s side. Maybe that used to call for flash briefing, but now pulls some different news format.   It’s driving me nuts, though. I want a briefing, not a full newscast. I started it at 9:34am and it’s 9:52am now, and NPR is still going strong. 😞"

"Hi all, I hope someone can help me out with this unique situation  My current household we have a bunch of various echo devices across multiple rooms linked to one amazon account.   I recently got my sister a echo for her room and some smart lights... the problem is when she says “Alexa turn off the lights”, the echo flex down the hallway hears it too and turns off the lights In the hallway as her echo is on a different Amazon account.

"Hi there,  I'm setting up my family's Alexa environment, and I've run into a couple of problems. I want each Alexa (each owned by a different person) to have all their own Spotify accounts, but also to be able to share audible books across all of them.

I'm having a really hard time finding a speaker that is on 24/7 or has an auto on feature and aux input.

"How would I go about creating a command shortcut for alexa?  For example: ""Alexa, turn off my computer"" Will run: ""Alexa, ask my robot to turn off bedroom desktop""  Would I need to create my own skill for this?"

"This might seem really stupid but I’m wondering how to make Alexa play something on one of the echo dot speakers, not by talking to Alexa but by sending an HTTP request from a raspberry pi. Everything I find in terms of documentation is to control the raspberry pi from Alexa but I’d like to do it the other way around.  Any ideas anyone?"
"So as stated I have an echo dot 3rd generation, and 2 Sonos one speakers; and its behavior has become very strange and erratic. A few things:  - I listen to podcasts on the echo. It will play but then during the podcast, completely seamlessly, it will rewind itself to an earlier point, sometimes 2 minutes ago, sometimes 20 minutes ago.  - I will ask the echo to play the latest episode of WTF with Marc Maron podcast, and it will play an episode from 1 month ago. This has happened numerous times, always the same episode from a month ago, and it doesn’t actually play it.  - I will ask it to play a song, even one that I own in my amazon library, or available through apple music which I have a subscription to (and enabled as my default service in the app) and it will say it is only available through an Amazon music subscription.  - I will ask it to play a song and it will say the song then just not play it.  - Sometimes I will be streaming a radio station on the Sonos and it will just stop playing randomly.  Other weird things have happened but those are the most recurring.  Do I need to reset something? It just feels like it’s not working all that well these days."
"Just asked Alexa what temperature it is, and after she answered, she said, ""By the way, we've spoken before, and it would be nice to learn your name.""  Um, one, Alexa, by the way, I can't use you without an Amazon account, and so you should already know my name, especially because I live alone and I'm literally the only person who ever talks to you.  And two, no, I don't really want you calling me by name. You're not my friend, you're a computer program. Please answer concisely and stop by the waying me.  What do you all think? Do you like your Alexa to call you by your name?"
"I've been trying to repair mine to do a naked install on a nice wooden board but I've been stuck for a while now and I believe it's the power and amplifier board down at the bottom that's causing all the trouble. So if anyone has a spare, I'd gladly take it :)"
I'm setting up the good morning routine and I want Alexa to disarm ring with it. The only option I see is arming it. But it arms it with the goodnight routine.   Is there a way to get it to disarm with good morning?
I like alexa to announce there is motion on my property  Thanks in advance
Would it be possible to get my echo dot 3rd gen to notify when my phone gets notification?
"When I say good morning to Alexa now instead of getting her normal voice with a little fact of the day or joke, I am getting a weird like motivational thing that tells me I’m beautiful and can do anything in a different voice with like a British accent. Or some kind of accent anyway. I’m not good with accents.   Anyone know what is going on? Is this happening across the board? Did maybe my ex girlfriend change some setting to make it play this? She was into this kind of self-help “tell yourself you are beautiful” kind of crap.  I just want the normal Alexa morning greetings back."
"Hello, I've done a google search about this, and I keep running into bed time routines rather than snoozing (eg delaying by ten minutes) a routine than I'm using as an alarm clock.  If I have something set as a routine, rather than an alarm, can snooze it with a vocal command?"
would I be able to connect speakers to the Echo Dot 3rd gen and play audio to both the added speakers and the Echo Dot at the same time?
So I’ve begin noticing that my Echo dot lights up every night at exactly 10:06 p.m. it doesn’t say anything but just lights up with the blue ring for about a second. i have DND enabled starting at 10 pm and don’t have any reminders or anything of the sort set up. Why does this keep happening?
I recently installed ecobee with Alexa built in and loving it. It appears that skills can be added to Alexa. Anyone know if one can add skill such as Alexa telling you when it's certain temperature outside or is that too advance for it?
"I have a routine where if I say ""Alexa I'm going inside"" it'll mute my backyard echo, turn off outside lights, etc"" but whenever I say the command Alexa will say ""okay bye for now"" and not run the routine. But if I say it again right after, the routine will run."
"I have the Samuel L Jackson voice on my Alexa. I tried “Alexa, ask Sam to Simon Says ...” but he tells me he can’t do it."
"I can get the light off in my kids room, turn on his nightlight and start his white noise with one command. Would love to add his sleeping playlist.   Bonus points if anyone knows of I can use flic or a similar smart button to start this routine."
"I'm sure this is a fairly common problem, just hope there's a known solution.  My hardware:  SmartThings Hub v2.0.  Various echos throughout the house.  AppleTV with Homekit enabled.  Mostly GE Z Wave switches and devices.  Also some legacy Wemo switches.  Some Philips Hue bulbs.  My goal:  To be able to use either Alexa or Siri to control devices. While I typically use Alexa, there are enough situations where it's just far more convenient to use my iPhone without opening the Alexa app.  The problem:  The Wemo and Hue hardware all shows up with 3 instances in the Alexa app. This causes it to be very unreliable. Only one of them actually works (always the one controlled by SmartThings)  My suspicion is that Alexa is scanning and finding a Wemo switch on the Wemo app (it has the Wemo skill) and on the ST hub, and maybe on the Homekit app? It doesn't have a Homekit skill. If not there, I don't know where the 3rd instance comes from.  I found one article that suggests limiting Alexa's ability to find devices on ST. My problem with that solution is twofold:  1. It presumably only eliminates one instance. 2. The ST version is the reliable working instance.  If anyone knows how to remedy this, I'd be very grateful!"
"Decided to buy echo show 8. Trading in 2nd gen dot for $5 and 20% off.  But the trade-in option  goes away if I try to add a bundle option( $5 blink mini, 10 smart plug, echo 5 etc...)  Anyone know if there is a workaround or do I have to buy ""device  only."" I figured I would add blink mini since it is only $5."
Alexa is of course the middle man between you and spotify. I listen to “lofi hip hop” on spotify frequently because it’s a nice background music. Starting last week alexa replies occasionally with “the content is only available on amazon music” and start playing from it. Did you get the same?
"Amazon released 20 Alexa commands this week, 10 of which are new (or newly-tweaked) to my weekly series. While duds are rare, Amazon has promoted broken and/or useless commands before, so if you’re looking for a quick gut check on all of them, view the post below.   [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-june-22nd/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-june-22nd/)   Learn anything new with Alexa this week? Or perhaps Alexa surprised you with a new response? Don’t keep it to yourself! Throw a comment up and let’s discuss."
"So it started like last week when I updated alexa on my phone. Now I can't voice command alexa to play any songs on spotify, I tried resetting, diregister, restart but no luck. it plays my playlist when I ask her but not other artists. I know some of you guys have experienced this also.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you!  PS: I'm from the Philippines"
I used to be able to command “alexa play coldplay/etc” and she’d play. But just yesterday and til now she says “i cant find songs by coldplay on spotify”   Ive already turned off and unlinked my acct then set it up again. Still no avail.   Any tips?
"Is it possible to create a routine and schedule it by Voice? For example I create a routine called ""turn on the coffee machine"" and would like to be able say ""Alexa, turn on the coffee machine tomorrow at 7am"".  Would be greatful for an answer because I don't have Alexa yet. Thanks!"
Title pretty much says it all. I want a smart deadbolt that can connect to my ring alarm system and doesn’t need anything more than the ring base station and echo plus to work.
" I have a Samsung tv connected to a fire tv cube. I’ve been able to turn the tv on and off perfectly fine until I connected a Samsung soundbar(not Alexa compatible) to the tv through an optic cable. Now that I have the soundbar, I can still turn the tv on by asking alexa, but when I try to turn it off, all it does is close whatever app is open, so it basically goes to the home screen. Anyone have an idea why?"
"I have an Echo Spot, and kind of hate it. I bought it with the intention of using it to make video calls, which was pointless. Everyone I talked to said the video quality was terrible and I didn't like looking into the tiny screen at the other person. I got a cover for the camera and I don't use the screen for anything really. I only interact with the screen to say ""COMPUTER TURN OFF DISPLAY"" multiple times a night when it wakes up due to me coughing. I honesty do need perfect darkness to sleep, and if I could completely and permanently disable the screen I would. Barring that, I would like to move it to another room and get a simpler Alexa enabled device for my bedroom. I was looking at the Dot, but apparently the newest version has an LED clock that can't be disabled?  I use the following features: Spotify to play music, timers, reminders, voice control of lights, query for the weather. I am not looking for anything fancy and not super concerned with high quality music sound. Is there a good device out there that can be made perfectly dark at night? Thanks!"
"title.     the actual devices are fine, but the app is shit."
"Im trialing virtual buttons right now, and it kinda works (wish it didn't have to open a browser screen every time activated).  I mean it just seems this should be an out of the box feature?"
"I tried the official alexa raspberry pi install guide and the github install guide you find all over youtube, is there any way at all to change the wake word?"
"I've spend a couple of hours struggling with this so thought I'd share a solution.  1. Create a new Routine, selecting voice if you want this to happen on a voice command  2. Add action  - Music - Play and enter the following without quote marks, and substituting MyPlaylist with the name of your own playlist  ""Shuffle MyPlaylist Everywhere""  3. Select Service - works on Spottily for me but I haven't tested other services  I can't believe the syntax is so inflexible, but hopefully this will save the other posters some time"
"I just purchased the new 3rd generation Echo Dot with the LED display to replace my 1st gen echo dot. Exactly as I did with my 1st gen, I connected the new dot via aux to an older JBL bluetooth speaker that I have permanently plugged into the wall (NO bluetooth connection).  Anytime I activate Alexa after a period of inactivity (20 minutes or so) there is complete silence for about 5-10 seconds. Eventually, the audio plays and I hear what she’s saying. I want to be clear there isn’t an issue with Alexa taking too long to respond, it’s an issue with the sound over aux taking too long to be recognized on my JBL speaker. When I eventually hear the sound, Alexa will be halfway through my morning briefing, or the weather, or anything I ask her to do.   I did not EVER have this issue with my 1st gen. It cannot possibly be the speaker or the aux cord, I know it’s this new echo dot. I’ve searched far and wide online and have found NOTHING - not even a similar report. It’s driving me out of my mind. I’m about to just return this and go back to my 1st gen.  If anyone has any solutions or has experienced a similar problem, please let me know. I’m very demoralized 😞 this new one is so much faster but effectively useless to me with this sound problem."
I’m thinking of investing in an Echo Auto so wondering if anyone would / wouldn’t recommend it in the UK?  Specifically I’m curious about ease of re-connection (once set up) - is anything required after getting in the car (assuming phone Bluetooth and data are always on)?  And data use - how much of your phone’s data does it tend to drain? I’m planning some heady Amazon Music use.   All opinions appreciated 👍
It's almost 4am. Who the fuck thought this was a good idea? Why is my Alexa randomly talking about some project I've never heard of unprompted at 4 am.
"So I use the question of the day skill (I find it fun) as part of my good morning routine. But often she’ll ask the question, I’ll give the answer, and then whether I’m right or wrong, she’ll respond in French! Heaven forbid I’m right because then I get a bonus question, which she then asks in French too! Thankfully I understand French, but not as well as English! Nor do I wanna do any trivia in French !  Has anyone else experienced Alexa switching languages in the middle of an interaction? If so, any advice? I have not turned on any languages at any given time or anything. I do, however, live in a primarily-French-speaking place"
"Hi recently purchased amazon show 8 for my grandparents, but yesterday when we drop in on any device to there amazon show they can hear us fine but we cannot hear them? Help is greatly requested"
"I bought a new Echo for the kitchen and decided to move the Dot to beside my bed.  As I like listening to audiobooks/ podcasts before going to sleep, I figured the Dot would sound better than my iPhones inbuilt speaker.   First thing I went to do was disable the mic, since I don’t really want it listening all the time. Turns out the red ring stays on permanent, no way to turn it off. Can’t have this staying on all night, not a fan of light in the room  Next thing was using Audible. Turns out I have to use the Alexa app to play them through the Dot, so once that was setup I started playing a book, however there is no option to play at 1.5x speed, nor is there the option to set a sleep timer from inside the app.   So I thought, Spotify will work with the Dot, I must be able to set a sleep timer with that. However when I go to set the sleep time in Spotify, it says I can’t and I need to disconnect from the Dot to do this.   The biggest reason for having a sleep time set from the app/phone is if my wife is already asleep, the last thing I want to do is start talking to Alexa and wake her up / scary the shit out of her.   Really disappointed with the fragmentation of these smart things. Everything seems to work on their own but not together.   Cmon amazon, sort this shit out 😅"
I'm trying to edit some parts of the alexa code so it indicates it's state with leds but I can't save anything! I looked under file specifications and found that I didn't have acces to edit any of the files in the avs device folder...   I tried to set that to anyone but then it gave me an error saying something about that I couldn't do that because I didn't have acces denied..  (I already tried opening it with sudo nano but then when I try to exit it doesn't react when I press Y to save)
"[I’ve modified this question, because it turns out that skipping to the previous song works when it’s playing back to a non-Fire TV speaker. So the following question is in the context of using a Fire TV stick as the playback device, in which case going back to the previous song is impossible.]  Ok, it is kind of strange that I can’t do this.  Has anyone figured out how to go back multiple tracks while listening to music?  You can go back to the beginning of the current track using “go back”, “skip back”, “go to previous” and what have you.  But no matter what, you seem to be able to go back to the beginning of the current song, not to any of the previous songs, which is really inadequate.  I looked up, and even this comprehensive webpage doesn’t tell you you can go back multiple tracks. https://www.smartenlight.com/alexa-music-voice-commands/  Is there a trick that anybody knows?"
I want Alexa to play the explicit versions of songs instead of the clean versions. How can I get this done?
"So I just bought a firecube for my father, and I was under the impression I could get rid of the echo dot because I read Firecube has a built in speaker for Alexa, Problem is Alexa doesnt work unless the tv is on. Anyone know if theres a setting I can change so I can hear Alexa even when TV is off?"
"Has anyone figured out how to tell Alexa to continue to play Spotify from another device?  On the mobile app, you can change the playback device from one to another seamlessly using Spotify Connect.  I’m trying to achieve a similar thing using voice control, but I haven’t been able to.  For example, “Alexa, continue to play this music on ***” doesn’t work.  Anyone with experience to share?"
"I have an Echo Dot 3rd gen, and I saw it updating before. Took some minutes, I don't remember so long.   Today, it's been updating for the past 4 or 5 hours, I've asked two times and the answer was the common ""I'm learning...""  Is it okay to take this long to update? It's happening with you too?"

"My alexa in my bedroom will flash notifications, and if my wife is sleeping I can't tell alexa to clear the notifications, it'll wake up my wife, and I can't sleep with the ridiculous blinking light.  1. Can app show notifications and let you clear there. 2. Can notifications be set to not flash from. Hr x to y 3. Is there some Other way to silently clear notifications"
"We just bought a Show for my dad and giving it to him tomorrow. We’d like his background to rotate select photos that we periodically upload for him. Should I do this via a Group, or Family Vault?

"There’s been plenty of talk about how you can review audio recordings saved by your Echo devices and other smart speakers, but I can’t find any tips on how to see if your Echo Show has any pictures or videos saved besides the ones Ive uploaded to Amazon photos myself.

"Alexa decided to remind me and my family that its Juneteenth today and added something about systemic racism.  I just find it a little disturbing that Alexa is stating this as if systemic racism is a fact (which it is not, its a political opinion). Did anyone else get this reminder with a side of systemic racism added?"
"I've got three 3rd Gen Echo Dots that I've had for about a week and am having a hard time understanding Alexa when she talks.  She sounds very ""muffled"" and bassy.  I've turned the audio settings on all three of them to minimum bass and maximum midrange and treble which helped some, but she's still not clear.  Is this just a function of the way the Dot is made and can't be improved??  Or is there something else I can do?"
"Started a couple of weeks ago. First, I could no longer trigger an Alexa routine using a Smartthings door sensor. Now, with a voice command, Most of my routines only respond partially. All of my lights can still be turned on manually, by pressing a button in the Alexa app, but most of my routines no longer work!"

"Recently bought a Visio smart tv off a friend. Already have multiple Alexa devises installed and operating for a couple of months in new house. Reset the TV to factory settings, set-up tv on my wifi network, installed Visio Smartcast app on my iPhone, enabled Alexa on Smartcast, enabled Smartcast on Alexa app... and now Alexa can’t seem to discover the smart TV. All devises are on 2.4 Ghz network. What am I doing wrong?"
"Up 'till today Alexa played songs from Spotify without a problem, but;  Today Alexa started answering she can't find xyz song or xyz artist on Spotify. She even says the whole name of the song (like I ask for bohemians rhapsody and she answers with "" I can't find bohemian rapsody (year) from queen on Spotify"" )  I checked that the echo and my Amazon account are registered to the same address and country, I relinked Spotify, I even de degistered and reregistered the echo dot I use, but the problem persist.  Anyone has any advice?"
"I have several of the Amazon discontinued Cloud cameras on the inside of my house. I have them all set up to look at home and away status and they're on when I'm not home and they're off when I am. I'd like to update that though so that I can turn them on with routine at bedtime and then turn them back off with another routine when I wake up. I found that it's really easy to turn them on as part of the routine, but turning them off is not something that can be done due to security reasons. I read on the help section that you would just need to open the Cloud Camera app to resync home at away status, but this doesn't appear to be the case. I have to go in to eat Hammer individually and toggle the home away status for it to update. Obviously this is kind of a pain. Is there anything else that I can do here?"
"Can anyone confirm this is happening to them as well? Other shows play fine with the voice command, but south park won't play the English version unless I manually select it despite the show being watched in ""My Stuff"" on Hulu, so it should know which show I'm watching. I've never changed my language settings and never watch anything that isn't in English, nor have I ever been out of the country for that matter.    This isn't a *huge* problem it's just annoying. South Park is my go-to for background noise and it's so much easier telling my Alexa to pull it up on my Firestick when I'm on my PC."
"uhm so all of a sudden , none of the songs EVER are on Spotify. no matter how many times I restart , re-register , link and unlink , Spotify does not play any songs I ask. anyone else got new solutions to this ? people on Twitter having the same problem"
"Hey everyone.   I recently received a Fire TV Cube for my birthday and love it. I already have an Amazon Echo Plus in my room that i use regularly. My question is, is there a way to sync both devices so that i do not have two separate hubs answering my questions? For instance, when i am sitting in front of my TV and i ask Alexa a question, the Fire TV Cube will respond. Likewise, when i am around other parts of my room, the Echo Plus that i have on my end table will respond.   Is there a way to have both devices answer simultaneously? A good example i thought of this morning was when i am listening to music on my Echo Plus, i would love to have the Fire TV Cube also playing in sync so that different parts of my room are playing the same music.   Sometimes it can be annoying when i ask Alexa something and the Fire TV Cube will pick it up instead of my Echo Plus, and vice versa.  Thanks!"
"This has happened four times in the past week. In the middle of the night, when my Alexa Show is on “Do Not Disturb” mode, it will begin reading a news story saying, “Here’s your story....”  Last night it happened twice, once at midnight and again at 2 am, when our bedroom is totally quiet. This is SO annoying when you are sound asleep to have Alexa wake you up!! Has this happened to anyone else? We are doing a factory reset, but would appreciate any suggestions."
"I noticed that when I activate Alexa, the media in the background keeps playing.  I end up missing some bit when I'm listening to a podcast, is there any way for it to pause?"
So I have alexa installed on my raspberry pi 4 and now I just want to have a command with which I can turn pins on and off on the raspberry. Without an external extra alexa of course... How do I do this?
"I have an X and an S in the living room, one used by me, the other my partner. Only the X is set up to be controlled by alexa but every time I tell it to do anything it controls the other console. The S hasn't git digital assistant enabled nor is it in my devices list on the alexa app?   Help? Anyone?"
"So I moved recently, and now none of my smart bulbs work properly. They just flash slowly, I tried to reconnect with alexa but they won't pair. Any ideas?"
"Hi all,  I’ve run into an interesting issue. My power went out today and when it came back on my control of my LED strip has gone out the window.   Background: I have a Maxonar strip that is connected to Smart Life, then to Alexa via the Smart Life skill. My control of the lights via voice and routines has been perfect for about a year until now.   I noticed the issue when one of my routines turned on the strip, the color was correct but the brightness seemed to be ~50%. I told Alexa to change the brightness to 100%, but instead of the brightness changing, the color changed to pink. I tried several commands of brightness and color and everything did something, but none of it was what I wanted it to do.   Control via the Smart Life app works with no issue.   I’ve tried removing the device from both Smart Life and Alexa, as well as disabling and re-enabling the skill, but neither did the trick. I’ll look and see if there’s some way to factory reset in the morning but it’s getting late and I’m not sure that’s a thing on the smart strip hub.   Has anyone run into this issue or know what could be the culprit?"
"I was checking all the settings to use the ring light in routines. For example to use it as a mood light, or change colors and patterns. Is it possible?"

"I've suddenly started having volume issues with my Echo Plus device. The device will randomly reset itself to the second lowest volume setting. I will increase the volume, and it will stay increased for a while, but then will inevitably reset itself to volume level 2. This happens at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day.   I tried factory resetting it, and when that didn't work I called Amazon expecting them to help me through this. They originally told me that this was a mass issue they were experiencing with my specific device, and that I would be added to their mass trouble ticket and given a call back to follow up. I never got a call back; three weeks later, I called to follow up.  The second time I talked with Amazon, they said there was no mass ticket/issue, and they had no idea what I was talking about.  ???  Then they told me that because it was out of warranty I was SOL. The best they can do is offer me a 15% discount to buy another alexa device.... (Why would I buy another Alexa device that I'm sure will just break down as soon as it's out of its warranty period??)  This is the first time I've truly been disappointed in Amazon's customer service. There's no way I could be at fault for this issue; this is clearly a product issue (hardware or software, I'm not sure). But because of a policy shield, I'm screwed. The rep even went so far as to say they couldn't be sure this type of issue wasn't my fault; how on earth could an issue like this be my fault?   I expect these devices to last longer than a year.... I'm very frustrated that Amazon is not standing by their own products, but instead is putting the customer on the hook for what is clearly a product malfunction.   Buyer beware. This feels to me that Amazon knows its products will break down as soon as the warranty is up, screwing you over and banking (literally) on the assumption that you'll just continually buy new Alexa devices.  Anyone else had a similar experience?"
"Probably 70% of the time when i try to ask Alexa something, she says ""sorry, Im having trouble connecting to the internet"". This being while she is fully connected, and I know this because sometimes I can ask her again right after and she works fine. It's really troublesome and I don't know how to fix it  Help please :)"
"I got two cheap Bluetooth speakers for my kitchen and backyard, ideally so I can play some background music from them while doing chores.  I don't seem to be able to add them as devices on the app, only pair them with an Alexa of my choice.  This let's me hear Alexa from the device, which works to an extent for what I want, but it then no longer works for my family in the living room if they want to use it. Is there any way around this?  I'd love to be able to just say ""Alexa, play rock music from Spotify in the kitchen""  While continuing to do the rest of it's sounds from the echo device itself"
"So i just got my echo dot, and i connected it to my Airlux smart lights. However, when I say ""Alexa, set lights to blue"", she changes them to pink. Every color seems to be the wrong color except for white. I use the Smart Life app for the lights, but I don't think it's that, because when I use Google assistant it changes the colors just fine. Anybody know what the issue is?  EDIT: Okay now the same issue is happening with Google assistant. Before I set up my Alexa, Google assistant changed the colors just fine."
"Lots of cool pre-built applets. I'm curious around the shopping list, if there is a way to add line breaks after each item so you get a nice list like this:  Item 1  Item 2  Item 3  Instead of...  Item1,Item2,Item3  &amp;#x200B;  :)"
"I've had this fan for about a year now and it's always worked flawlessly with Alexa (turning on lights, turning off the fan, etc). All of a sudden when I ask to turn on the lights Alexa responds with ""Bedroom light isn't responding please check its network connection and power supply."" There doesn't seem to be an issue with either the network connection or the power supply because I can control the fan from both my phone and the remote it came with. I've tried disconnecting the fan from Alexa and adding it back on, however, nothing changed. In addition, I've reset my Alexa, again nothing changed. If you know a way to fix this it would be greatly appreciated!"
"If I use the audio out port to connect to my surround sound system, and I have Echo Dot linked to my fire tv, can you still talk to Alexa without muting or lowering the sound on the fire tv? I’m asking because my son might be watching a cartoon or something and we ask Alexa something and it mutes the show while she talks. I’m asking if there is a way around it because my SO was asking me."
"Hi,    my brother keeps connecting his phone to my alexa and blasting music. It's extremely obnoxious and even though he has no permission to do it, he still does. Is there some way to lock him out from being able to do this, maybe with a PIN or something? I could obviously physically move it somewhere but I would rather not."
"Trying to connect set up my smart bulbs so they can be controlled with alexa but im unsuccessful so far. I've gone through all of the troubleshooting steps in the instructions, I've used Easy Mode, AP mode, and Bluetooth detection on the Geeni App but it still continues to say ""unable to add device"".  When Trying AP mode, under the device Hotspot Names it says ""connected without internet"" making me unable to progress the set up process. I've tried resetting my internet and it didn't help so im at a complete loss. Any help is welcomed."
This is an odd one. I have an Echo Dot in my bedroom and just last night I asked “Set a sleep timer for 40 minutes” while playing some music and it worked. Then tonight I try it and I get “Sleep timers are not supported on this device”.   Any ideas? I tried unplugging and replugging but I still get the “not supported” message. Did Amazon nerf the Dot or something to try and get me to buy a newer/different one?
"So about a year or so ago, the Echo we have started asking if we have seen a dog. Yes we have three doggos. No we do not have any apps or features for the doggos.  We ask it what do you mean or ask her the same thing and we get the normal automated response.  So I come here to ask wtf is wrong with the demon in the box."
"I need lights to turn ""pale green"", a color which alexa recognizes, but isn't an option in the colors available in the menu to change colors in a scene. How would I go about this?"
"I recently upgraded to the second generation of the echo plus, and I never had this problem with the first generation. Whenever it is playing music or my flash briefing, it has a hard time hearing the Alexa cue. Has anyone else experienced this, or is something up with mine?"
"I'm about to throw these little pieces of garbage out the window! What am I missing here? Is this the quality of Amazon nowadays?  I have 2 dots, both have the fabric wraps, not sure what generation they are.  I have one named Left Dot, one named Right Dot. They are together in a speaker group called Office. Both are connected to the same wifi.  I changed my command word from ""Alexa"" to ""Computer"" for these two speakers.  I say ""Computer, play Spotify"". Either speaker might pick me up, it says ""this is Spotify"".   Music only plays out of the Left dot. Only left. I can control the volume with the Right dot, just no sound. Check the Alexa app and it shows music playing on Office.  Then, within 5 minutes, the music stops. I look in the app, and it shows it's still playing on Office.  I've unplugged both many times, that seems to work for a limited time. This is so unreliable. The sound quality isn't bad when it actually does work.  &amp;#x200B;  Thoughts?

Alexa randomly started doing [this](https://voca.ro/mBeS6aFZmJR)
"Ok so i have a google home mini in my bedroom and i just got my alexa today and put it by my PC. been playing around with it and i can't find out how to replicate an action in my routine that is on my mini on the alexa ( would like to have the same routine on both so when im downstairs i can say the bedtime routine and my lights/tv will be on when i get upstairs). I have a roku tv and i have it set up on the mini so when i say ""ok google bedtime"" it will turn on my lamp+tv and after that i have a command in there saying ""launch xfinity app"" and that is the last step in the routine, but i can't seem to find out how to do that in the alexa app, yet if i say launch xfinity app to alexa it knows the tv and it launches no problem. I just need it to be added to the end of the routine as if i was saying it."
"I am happy with this device so far, and here's why:  1. This $60 device replaces a 16-year-old microwave with a defective button pad.  1. I have already used the water preset to make passable tea 1. The setup was automatic. I was still reading the directions when it connected. 1.  The microwave *looks* like it belongs in my apartment.  1. I feel like a total boss just looking at it - ""Alex, play the space 1999 tv theme"" 1. I am no longer one of those luddite savages pressing buttons to make the magic box work  As far as complaints, go:  1. There's a preset for coffee (*Bleagh!*), but not tea. Savages.  1. the magical list of presets is *very* short, but Amazon really played it up as something special. I'm hoping that they add a lot more.   Other than that,  I have had this thing for three hours, and I'm pretty happy. But then, I would be happy with any new microwave with working features. My old microwave is a disgusting mess with a broken keypad, so it doesn't take much to make me happy."
"When I say Alexa, I often times don't get any alert that she heard me and is activated, is there a skill or setting I can change so it makes a more distinctive noise or she says something to specify that she heard? Ik there's a default noise but it doesn't always work for sum reason"
"So my show shuffles through several news stories and at the bottom of the screen it says Try... “Alexa, why’s the (fill in the blank) story” to have the story read. However, sometimes I glance up at it too late and miss the prompt. Is there a way to check out a list of the stories or a prompt to view recent stories?"
"Hi everyone, new here. Recently got an Echo Dot, and signed up for 30 day trial of Amazon Music. For the most part not having any issues, however I have created a playlist on the Amazon Music app that I want Alexa to play through the Echo Dot, but it's just not happening. I've tried following the steps online I can find, but to no avail. How do I get my playlist to play on the Echo Dot and NOT on my phone? Thanks in advance!"
"I have a Sony SRS-X11 that I started using to play music on (through Alexa) when I'm in my study. I've been using my phone's Alexa App to control it as the Echo device in the other room won't be able to hear me properly from this far away (especially through a closed door). If the bluetooth speaker has a voice call function (so it has built in microphone), is it possible to use it to control Alexa? I could not find any guides for it as the search keywords keep pointing towards using the Echo as a bluetooth speaker...  Thanks in advance for any intel on this."
"I continue to explore the latest Alexa commands with highlights from this week ranging from BLM, Amazon’s global university competition, and a new audiobook to celebrate Pride Month.   Check it out here:  [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-june-15th/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-june-15th/)  Today’s post covers 20 commands Amazon released this week for Alexa, 9 of which are new capabilities I’ll review and serve to add to the extensive list of Alexa tips and tricks (found [here](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/category/voice-assistants/alexa/keeping-up-with-alexa/)).  As always, I welcome your thoughts on what capabilities caught your eye."
"The bedroom has 2 no. Hue bulbs both listed under bedroom, and a Dyson fan simply called Fan (not part of any group), though in the Dyson app it is under the ROOM name Bedroom.  Using Devices on Android app and selecting Bedroom allows light control. Great.  Selecting Fan controls the fan. Great.    Issuing a voice command ""Alexa, turn on Bedroom"" turns on the fan.   Likewise for turning off.  Via voice no dimming works on the bulbs.    Disabling the Dyson Skill and re-enabling is a temporary fix for a few hours.  The only workaround I can think of that might fix it is in the Dyson app call the room Fan, which makes no sense."
Sorry if this post would be better suited in another subreddit.  I thought it would be cool if I created an alexa skill of stories. Mostly my children would get the benefit of this. I can't always be with them when they are going to bed. I thought it would be nice if they could hear a story from him.  Is this feasible? I have been poking around the amazon tutorials and it seems quite doable. Just wanted to double check with the community before I start this plan in action.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks for reading.
"I recently purchased a Ring Alarm system, as I am already well invested into their ecosystem. Sadly, the Ring system doesn't have glass break sensors (or an external siren for that matter, come on Ring!).  I came across Alexa Guard yesterday, but can't find the settings within my Alexa app. Seems it's only available in the US, is that the case? Any rumors of when we might get it this side of the ocean?"
It is valid. It is on tunein. It doesn't work. It seems bloody useless.
"I want to play \[Brain.fm\]([https://www.brain.fm/](https://www.brain.fm/))'s sleep music on my Alexa. Currently, there is no integration so I have to pair it with my Bluetooth and get to have that music."
"I used to be able to tell Alexa, ""turn lights off"" and it would turn off the lights of whichever room that Alexa device was in.  But now it just says ""sorry, a few things share the name 'lights.'  Which one did you mean?""  Is there any way to bring that old feature back?  Like an Alexa Skill or anything...?"
All the google posts say to click options that I don’t see. Can someone help me out?
Some time ago I changed my account for a USA location so I could unlock other skills. But then i changed again to my country and language both Amazon account and Alexa app.   When I go to the skills store there isn't any skills for Brazil.   My Alexa app is in Brasil Portuguese mixed with some English. What could it be?
"It would be great if Alexa had a camera to see if there are multiple people in the room. Alexa should avoid feedback questions or maybe even reminders when there are multiple people in the room.   I don't throw parties often, but I use it for reminders often. I don't want my party music interrupted to tell me to do the laundry.   Would a camera for situational awareness be good?"
"Is there a way to limit how loud my amazon tap makes announcements such as, ""now connected to bluetooth"" It's pretty annoying to have to quickly turn down thw volumw on the device when it is connected and then have to turn it back up again to hear the music that I was playing. Thank you for your help!!"
I’m looking at getting my dad an Alexa Show for Father’s Day so that we can do video calls. I was wondering if there is anyway to record a video and send it as a message that would play on the show? The idea is that I’m assuming that once my 2 y/o does it once he’ll not want to stop. So instead of calling them a dozen times I’d like to send videos that they can easily view on their show.

"Do you know what is going on? Do you know any way to fix this without resetting the broadlink devices? I have 3, two Pro’s and one mini. All of them worked, then one day they all stopped working correctly, with the same problem for all.   For instance, I have one device called “ceiling light”. Alexa will say it can’t find a device named “ceiling light” if I try to speak commands. However, if I go in the Alexa app, “ceiling light” is still there and I can still turn it on or off by pushing the button in the app. It also appears and works normally in the ihc app.   This has also been like this for over a week so waiting for it to resolve also doesn’t seem to have worked. I’ve tried unlinking and relinking ihc in Alexa, and unplugging the broadlinks and Alexas.   I don’t want to spend the many hours again that it took to program all the devices, which I think is my only option if I try resetting the Broadlinks.   Any ideas?"

"I have a 3rd generation Alexa dot that I won in a raffle last year. It's been unplugged and in storage for a little while and I just pulled it out yesterday. It wasn't humid or anything where it was stored and it has never been in contact with any liquids.  Upon powering it up, it will turn on (blue ring) then have the teal bar running clockwise for a while before shutting off and trying again. I've heard that the length of the bar determines how far along in the process it is? It gets to the point where it takes up two thirds of the ring and immediately shuts off. Trying to reset it will cause the blue ring of death and the only way to fix it is to unplug it.   It won't turn orange. It won't turn red if I mute the microphone. I cant adjust the volume. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, I tried doing that in 5 minute intervals, I tried waiting 30 minutes and doing it again. I tried leaving it on mute overnight. I'm using the original cable and plug in (all one unit) and its plugged into the main wall outlet in the room, not a power strip. Its not on Do Not Disturb mode. I tried deleting it from my Alexa app, but I can't put it back on because it won't reset or even turn on fully.  I won't be able to get another one. Any advice?"

"I just purchased a new TV from Philips, which is capable of Alexa Integration. Or at least that is what was advertised.  You can find the skill here: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-Smart-TV-Voice-Control/dp/B07JFSPV73](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-Smart-TV-Voice-Control/dp/B07JFSPV73)  The problem is that the skill is only available in the United Kingdom, as Philips told me. After talking to Philips for a few days, and almost begging them to make the skill available in Romania (where I'm currently located), I couldn't find any common grounds with them. All their responses were something along the lines of ""contact Amazon"", ""it's Amazon's fault"" and so on.  &amp;#x200B;  I tried contacting Amazon via email, but I got back a response saying that email support is not supported at the moment.  &amp;#x200B;  What can I do? How can I contact Amazon, just in case that they can do something about this skill?  &amp;#x200B;  I have to mention that I tried changing my country to the UK and I was able to download the skill, but that made all my other skills unavailable.  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you!"
"Basically in my goodnight routine, after she turns off my light, etc, I want her to ask if I want her to play my sleep playlist.   (Sometimes I go right to sleep and other times I watch Netflix first.)

"At the start of the lockdown I got my Dad and I Echo Shows so we could Skype regularly. Everything was fine until about a week and half ago when his device stopped ringing if I placed a call to him. He can ring me just fine.  He doesn't have a smart phone. so there's no app he can have fiddled with, and I doubt he goes into the web app either. The whole point was to get something plug-and-play to make it easy for both of us to stay in touch while we're having to self-isolate a long way apart.   Does anyone have any ideas what might have happened? My brain is completely fogged out due to my medical treatment and I'm really hoping there's just something simple I can talk him through..."

"First time posting here, so please let me know if this question should be posted elsewhere. I also posted this at r/amazonecho:  I bought my dad an Amazon Echo, and I'm attempting to connect his Spotify account to it. I've  Important Notes:  * I'm using the [browser version](http://alexa.amazon.com/) of the Alexa app to manage the account, not a mobile app. I'm not sure if this matters. * I'm located within the U.S.  The Echo is connected to WiFi and working fine. However, when I go into the Alexa account settings to select the default music station/library, Spotify [isn't even listed](https://imgur.com/wONSZUo) as an option.  From researching online, apparently most people who have this problem are located outside the U.S. The most commonly proposed solution is to go into your Amazon Account ""Your Content and Devices"" settings and change your country to the United States.  Like I mentioned, we're already in the US. To be safe, I went in and re-entered [the correct location info](https://imgur.com/plpAwqP) anyway.  After doing this, unplugging the Echo and logging in and out of the Alexa app (browser version), it's still not working. The Amazon support line is currently unavailable, so I can't get in contact with them. They have bigger fish to fry at the moment, so I understand.  Anyway, I was hoping to get this set-up for my dad's birthday...so any help or proposed solutions would be greatly appreciated!"
"I got a second Alexa only to use them as stereo.   I used one before as a PC speaker because it was most comfortable and the sound was okay.  What the great minds of Amazon didn't think about/what's wrong with it:  You can't use two, when being in Bluetooth mode. So you can't use it to play audio from your PC or when steaming music via Bluetooth from your phone to it. only one is working then.  It's having a huge latency when it comes to song selection via Spotify and has problems in general. Like I chose a song on Spotify via phone or computer and it takes several seconds until it starts. Then sometimes only one works when even though the 'room' is selected and not one single Alexa.  Sometimes it takes almost a minute until it works as it should.  The best part: you stick headphones in? Well yeah the sound is now in your headphones, but the Alexa won't mute itself. So you have to select one Alexa and then stick the headphones in. But the Alexa which is the right channel, won't be shown as a selection. So if you want to use headphones and your left Alexa isn't near you, because you used always the right one for headphone stuff: well shit happens.   I'm using the second one only since 3 days and some things are just so damn annoying.. don't they check their functions before releasing? How could this even pass any tests. Feels like some alpha build."
"Hey all!  I'm looking for a cheap(ish) setup so I can put some (any) kind of water/splash proof speaker in our shower.  The problem is, I could only find bluetooth devices with their own built in power supplies or wifi devices without Alexa compatibility.  We do have a spare outlet in the bathroom so power isn't a problem, but I would like the echo in the living room to control the speaker for now (maybe I'll get an echo flex just for the bathroom later, but that would still need a somewhat acceptable speaker to listen to music while under the shower).  Any suggestions?  I was thinking of a cheap jbl constantly plugged in as a cheap way to get around the problem, but I would prefer to have something that Alexa can actually turn off when it's not in use."
"I have my Spotify linked through my echo dot and it usually works fine, except today every song I play will keep cutting out at exactly 2/3 of the way through?! This has happened about five or six times now and I can’t seem to work out what would be causing it.  I have Premium, so my music is all downloaded offline. I’ve had no issues with my internet connection (phone &amp; laptop have been working fine). I’ve also unplugged it multiple times and when I turn it back on it’s still the same.  Any suggestions?"

Sometimes it will get past that and go into the orange setup light but then the light freezes and again restarts itself.. but when she starts taking about ""the device is ready to setup"" it makes a crashing sound and again restarts itself.. can anybody tell me what I'm doing wrong or if the device is faulty?"
My Alexas(2) will both skip or stutter. I always have to unplug and plug them back in. Is this a known problem? Does this happen to all?
"So I used one as my PC speaker, since it was more comfortable at that distance and the sound ain't that bad either.   Then I got another one because I wanted to see how the stereo function is working. The sound is so nice (probably because both speakers got a wider spectrum now, due to seperation of THE channels).   But I can't connect Alexa via Bluetooth and use the two as speakers. I can only use one.  Is there a way so this could be working? Some voice call skill being modified so the PC calls Alexa 1 and Alexa 2, but splits the channels into left and right? I don't know if that makes any sense because I'm no programer or anything."
"I've recently bought Hue White Ambiance and I'm loving it.   I tried using routines but unfortunately the ""warm"" color is not the warmest possible.  Is there any command to set the lights to the warmest mode possible?"
"My inlaws told me that their Echo sometimes give unsolicited advice even when the microphone is off. ""It's hot today. Stay hydrated""... stuff like that.  I suggested they shut off notifications and announcements. But is this an official thing? Unprompted notifications with the mic off?"
"I have a few routines setup where Alexa says a phrase when the sensor opens, for example 'Front door open'. However, for the past 48 hours these have stopped working. The contact sensors are working in Smartthings and I can even see them open and close when I look at devices in the Alexa app. Anyone have any idea why they would have suddenly stopped? Thanks!"
"Ive been trying for ages to get my alexa to call a friends alexa but it just calls her phone instead, we’ve tried her calling me instead and her alexa just says that mine isnt set up for call, so i checked the app and it is.

"Does this happen to anyone else? Suddenly, songs that I’ve listened to before are only available from Amazon Music Unlimited. Alexa asks if I want to subscribe, and I tell her yes; we go through all the motions, I buy the subscription, and she plays the song. Several days later, same thing happens. Why? How do I fix it for good?"
"I moved my Show 8 yesterday and the clock moved from the top left of the screen to the bottom left once I plugged it in.

I’m in an apartment with some tricky configuration on bathroom to bed and combinations of turning off lights in room before bed.  Is there an Alexa speaker that has a built in lamp/light ?  I’m guessing the answer is no this doesn’t exist.   Just thought I’d check.
"Is there any way to shuffle what photos show in the album on the Show devices? I have a Show 8 I just upgraded to from a first gen show, and was wondering if there’s any way to shuffle the Facebook photos. It doesn’t have the same wallpaper choices as the a Show 5s do (I have 2 Show 5s as well) so instead of boring choices, I decided to use it as my new digital frame basically. Only issue is it just goes through the album from beginning to end then loops back all in order. I’d like to be able to shuffle them.  I made a specific album on Facebook for my Portal superframe, which is nice since I was just able to use the same album.

"I just installed smart switches throughout my house (Kasa) and I really like them so far. I know that if I have an echo and a light set as being in the same room in the Alexa app I can say “turn on the light” and she will turn it on, however she doesn’t think switches are lights. Do I have to say “turn on the switch”? Or is there a way other than routines to do this? I have multiple rooms with Echoes and switches I’d like to be able to do this in."

Anything that comes with Alexa built-in should work reasonably well (some better than others, sure) and hopefully we can get one that sounds better. Thanks for any help!"

We don’t want an Echo or other smart speaker, we just want to have our smart devices controlled from the Alexa app.  What I can’t figure out is how can we both control the devices from our own phones?  It’s tough googling for this answer because it seems every article is for an Echo or other smart speaker.  Seems like the household feature of the Alexa app no longer exists?"
"I want to set up a routine so that if I say “bedtime” to Alexa it starts a “baby bedtime lullabies” skill and then stops after half an hour.  However, when I try to create the routine it won’t let me do that.  The routine I’m trying to create first turns the volume down low, then opens the required skill, but then when I add “wait 30 mins” I’m told the skill must come last and it moves the “wait” command up to second place.

So far most of the things are working well and I found my ""love"" for Alexa again 😁.  &amp;#x200B;  There is only one strange behavior. I do have a few smart plugs that I do use to turn on several ""dumb"" devices e.g. a Pond, a Globe, ""dumb"" Lightstrip etc.  In the Alexa App I set the type for these devices to Plug (""Stecker"" in german) as I don´t want them to turn on when I say ""Turn on the lights in the Living Room"".  Alexa seems to ignore this and still turns on/off switches when I use the light phrase.  I first thought that this may be something thats related to Home Assistant skill. I then tried to connect a Belkin WeMo directly to Alexa and got the same behavior. So nothing that has to do with the skill.  Does anyone have an idea?  https://preview.redd.it/uuka2tkxzw351.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b93313f8f809c74b2c896ec70419403d79f54328  Thanks in advance!  &amp;#x200B;  Regards  rvst1"
"A factory reset Tap. I connect to setup. It sees the wifi network. It has the wifi password from another device. The blue line goes half way across. Then a message ""there was a problem setting up your device"".  The router shows the Tap as connected.  I've made sure the Tap is not registered.  Any help appreciated."
Has anyone else experienced this? Or can anyone identify the commercial or show it came from? Or have the ghosts in my house finally mastered Alexa?
"Bit of a long one this, so, I would love to be able to change Alexa's wake word or stop her responding entirely with either a command or a button on my phone. Reason behind this, my kids love hijacking her and turning the lights off etc etc, changing her wake word helps but I hoped someone has a better solution."
"It’s almost a running joke in our house at this point. Alexa displays the yellow ring, and no matter how we ask all we get is “you have a new notification, from Alexa” or something like this.  After 2 or 3 tries we figure out the “magic phrase” and then proceed to immediately forget it for next time.  Seems like it should be easier to get Alexa to *read* the notification itself. Or maybe it’s just me...."
"Hello is there a way to setup for a table lamp to turn on easily within the amazon alexa app? I don't have the actual alexa just a smart plug added to the amazon alexa app. Every time I have to open the app, go to devices, then click the light, then click for it to turn on/off. Is there any easier way without getting the actual alexa?"
"We are about to move into a new house with a wired speaker system that spans many rooms and outdoors. It seems great, but I don't know how to use it with ""smart"" tech. What I have is a bunch of those black and red wires with a ""u""-shaped end in one central location that connect to many distributed speakers. I am wondering if I can make all of this work with Alexa. I am assuming I need something to bring all the speaker wires together into one place, then that object connects to Alexa, either through the AUX or Bluetooth. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
"I must be doing something wrong, as it can not be this difficult.  If I set a timer with Alexa, and want to cancel it I can say ""Alexa, cancel timer"" and it works.  When I set a 2nd timer, even if I name it, when I try to cancel the timer I get ""you have x timers set, a ...""  how do I cancel a specific timer??  I've tried ""Alexa, cancel 2nd timer"" or ""Alexa, cancel pasta timer"", but then I get that there is a timer with x amount of time left.  I get frustrated and then cancel all timers.  very annoying."
"Then gather the tiny pieces into a pile and set it alight. Then stamp on it?  &amp;#x200B;  Anyone else? I have so many problems with it I wish I'd just bought a bluetooth speaker or Google's version.  It does nothing well, my dot buzzes when it plays music. Often it will play out of the wrong speaker, or just one or not at all. I have to be careful to make sure to say ""Spotify"" EVERY.SINGLE.F\*\*\*\*\*G.TIME I want to play anything.  I ask it to play Train earlier. ""Play the ARTIST ""TRAIN"" on Spotify"" - ""Playing Megan Trainer on spotify"". Who the f\*\*k is that? How is that anything close to what I said?  I even have to scream to get the dot to hear me.  Just seems like everything is so much harder than it has to be and the device never seem to work as intended. Why would I invest in accessories and a smart home when the base product sucks?  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry for the rant, thanks for listening.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Now it's just say ""That device is offline."" Like what device? The one making sound right now? I obviously don't want to play it on the offline device!  [This thing played Mega trainer 10 times in a row. It clearly heard Train. Is Train not a famouse band anymore?](https://preview.redd.it/lheyp7ioep351.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86c65b361d616e1244abf3babf6147f064694e14)"
"and she ended it by asking me if I'd like the pollen count as well. uhhh hell YAH! I've decided I \*def\* need to know this information. I tried setting up a routine and selecting play weather, but i want her to include the pollen count as well. How do I make sure she does that?"
"We’re already into the second week of June! This week, Alexa shows off Podcast integrations and recommendations, trivia games, and Science Fiction stories.  See all 20 commands and their breakdown here:   [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-june-8th/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-june-8th/)  Let me know if you uncovered any cool Alexa commands recently."
I'm trying to add my apple calendar to my Alexa and in the app after I create my app key the page just continues loading forever (cycling the three dots).  I've tried restarting the app and my phone.  I've tried on my wifi as well as my cell network.  Same results.  Any ideas?
"I just got this thing, and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing with it. Currently thinking that I could use it to yell at me to do chores, but I all I can find are certain skill app things (I'm technically inept) and I'm not sure which one to use. Anyone have any idea on which Alexa skill would be most useful?"
"Hi. My situation: We have a nanny that moved in last night. We have our whole house configured to be a smart home (lights, thermostats, etc). She has her own Alexa to control her part of the house but also obviously needs to control the common areas as well when she is keeping the baby during the day.   My husband and I share an amazon account and have two voice profiles under the account. Always worked fine.  I set her up her own amazon account as the second adult in our household and connected to Alexa because I think that’s the only way to have two Spotify accounts connected.  Also my husband and I don’t really want her to see our order history on Alexa. Nothing to hide but occasionally we might buy her surprises etc and it’s easier than trying to archive or hide orders. But now it is getting so complicated to add all the skills, devices, and set up each and every routine all over again. 🙄  I’m wondering if the second account instead of another voice profile was the right thing to do.   The only requirements: (1) be able to control devices as needed (2) link to her Spotify account  Can someone help advise me on the best way to manage a second adult (not immediate family) living in the household?"
"I have a script I've written that starts an alarm on two echo's (1 dot and 1 show). if I say Alexa, Stop All Alarms, she stops on the responding echo but the other one continues. If I issue the exact same command again, she'll stop the alarm on the other echo, responding with '&lt;time&gt; alarm stopped on &lt;name of device&gt;'  Is there a single command I can issue to just have her silence all echoes at once rather than repeat myself?"
"Has anyone encountered an issue with Alexa controlling Ring Security system? Specifically, when I ask Alexa to disarm, she will ask for my keycode. After giving her the proper code, she responds with ""Alexa is not authorized to perform that action."" I can go in and relink the two devices, but that only lasts about a day or so (~2 disarms)."
"I have a newly purchased echo spot that I’ve set up in a guest bedroom. I want to make it as easy as possible for my guests to turn the tv on or off using just their voice. Easy enough, right? NOT SO EASY AT ALL.   I purchased a new tv, the V-series Vizio with smartcast and for all intents and purposes it should pair. I’ve set up the Alexa skill in the Alexa app and enabled Alexa on the tv. But Alexa can not find the damn device, no matter how many times or ways I ask her to discover new devices. I’ve spent enough hours today trying to figure it out, including reading all of the google and contacting tech support twice (which were both less enjoyable than poking both my eyes out with a sharp stick).   Does anyone have any idea what I’m missing or doing wrong?!"
"So my echo first made a ""notifications"" like sound followed by a really loud camera flash sound, similar to the screenshot sound on iPhone.  I asked Alexa if I had any notification or what the sound was for and nothing. I also checked my Alexa app, but nothing was there either...  &amp;#x200B;  It was really strange and my partner also heard it! We are still puzzled by this. Does anyone know what it could be?"
"So I have a Echo show, but I also have quite a few Sonos One’s.  I have not enabled Alexa on the Sonos One’s as I am concerned that when I say ‘Alexa’ in a room, that mutliple devices will pick it up.    Is there a way that only 1 device picks it up?  I would expect it to be the closest in other works the one that hears Alexa the loudest.  I am aware you can change the name ‘Alexa’ on different systems/speakers, but this it not really a good option for me."
"My Echo just started playing a Dairy Queen ad out of nowhere. I wasn't even listening to anything. When I asked what was playing it just said ""An advertisement for Dairy Queen"". I waited to see if it would start playing music, like maybe it thought I asked it to play a radio station? But no, it just played another ad so I asked it to stop. I checked the activity history and there was no record of any requests before me asking about the ad. Is this normal?"
"I have bought some tracks from Amazon music as well as uploaded 250 tracks for free  before that was outlawed (but got to keep the tracks).  Today when I try to play my playlist ""brown noise on amazon music"" I hear ""Playing specific songs is only available with amazon music unlimited."" WTF?  I own these songs?  I bought them from Amazon, but now I can't play them?  Is anyone else seeing this? Any work around?"
"Okay, I just asked Alex's to play Baby Driver by Simon and Garfunkel. She responded incorrectly with Playing Baby Driver on Fire TV.  I told her to stop and repeated my request. She responded exactly the same trying to open Fire TV even though nothing in my command mentions TV.  Stopped again. Finally got her to cooperate by rephrasing to Play the song Baby Driver by Simon and Garfunkel.  So then I went to the app to check the cards and feedback. The two times she tried to launch Fire TV are not there!?   So how come she hears, misunderstood TWICE but no cards are there to correct like it never happened?"
"I need help connecting this Phillips hue bulb, and it is an older model without Bluetooth, and I don't have a Hue Bridge, but I have an Echo Plus. I feel the main problem may be that the bulb has been previously set up in a different house. If anyone can help me solve this problem I would be very grateful."
"I am looking at getting a fire 7 to mount on a wall to act as a hub or controller for our whole smart home, which has gotten pretty extensive. Has anyone else done this?"
"So my setup is : Logitech elite remote with hub Echo dot 3rd gen Dyson am09  I've setup my logitech harmony to control my Dyson fan via ir which works fine.

"guys lets me explain my case.  2 phones 2 echo dots.  wife phone connected with her alexa acc  husband phone connected with alexa acc  &amp;#x200B;  cool.  &amp;#x200B;  kitchen dot  and bedroom dot already full connected to husband phone.  &amp;#x200B;  when I setup the 2 dots to my wifes phone, the 2 dots disappear from my devices list in  my phone.  &amp;#x200B;  so I back to my phone and add again the 2 dots, and the 2 dots disappear from my wife phone.  &amp;#x200B;  what f... I am doing wrong? hahah I think will send it back."
My wife is about to stomp on all of our Echoes.  We have 6 in our house.  She will give the kitchen echo a command and an echo in one of the bedrooms on the other side of the house will answer.  She is standing directly in front of the kitchen echo.  Does anyone have any suggestions?
"I use my Alexa for audiobooks every night, and most books it plays normally until I tell it to stop. But two books I’ve had recently(not consecutively, it’s clearly something with these books) just abruptly stop 1) at the end of each “part” of 2) at the end of every chapter.   I have listened to both a couple of times and this is persistent with exclusively(so far) these two books.  Anyone have any fixes?"
"My Alexa has lost my smart plug for my kettle. Now It will not find it or any other device I want to pair. I have used a different smart plug, I have turned Alexa off. Nothing helps and its starting to annoy me as she stands now is just a radio. Thank you"
"Hey,  so I received a new Echo Dot yesterday, and I was trying to connect it to my primary calendar, which is Google Calendar.  I was able to connect it, but so far I am aonly able to have my appointments read out and created.  However, I'd really like to also have reminders, which I primarily use in google calendar. So far whenever I create a reminder, it ends up in the alexa reminders. Also, it won't read out any.  Is this possible?"
"So I recently purchased the cygnett beginners setup which includes a temperature monitor.   I have setup the cygnett skill in the Alexa app and the monitor is detected and I can view the temperature.  My question is, should I be able to use this device to trigger a routine? Currently I don't see any smart home devices when configuring a routine trigger."
"I recently bought Alexa 3rd Gen, do i need to buy a hub to control the lights or it's already inside Alexa?"
"So I have my echo show sitting right next to my computer monitor, and when I’m working I also like to listen to Spotify on my headphones from my computer. Is there a way where I can display what I’m listening to on my computer on my echo show?"
"Hello all,  I have an Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation and have set up a playlist called ""Roar"".  In the past, I have been able to say ""Alexa, shuffle my Roar playlist"" and she plays it properly.  Now, whenever I say ""Alexa, shuffle my Roar playlist"", I only get Katy Perry's Roar.  I have been able to get it to play other playlists like ""Classical"" and ""Country"" and ""Techno"" but it would only play Katy Perry's Roar...  Same thing happens with my ""Motivation"" playlist where it only plays Sum 41's Motivation.  I've unplugged the Echo Dot and cleaned up any dust, but it still plays the wrong songs with those two playlists...  Thanks for any help you can provide!"
"Anyone know of a skill to create like a voice interface thing? Like ""if you have questions about the property, say property, if you want to know the address, say address"" etc.   Or even just keyword suggestions. Idk what such an interface skill would be called"
"For example, I'll say ""Alexa play Solar Opposites on Hulu"" and sometimes it'll start playing the show, but sometimes I'll get a message on my tv telling me to use my remote (the specific message is in the title). So clearly Roku is hearing Alexa, but for some reason it only wants me to use the remote sometimes. Does anyone know how I can fix this?   Also, bonus question: does anyone know how I can directly control Netflix with Alexa?"
"I am trying to setup a ""Household"", so that my Fiance and I can both use our accounts with our devices. I have found many articles and tutorials showing how to do this and the Alexa help section even references setting up a ""Household"", but when I go into Alexa app --- settings --- account settings there is not a  “Amazon Household” option.  I am trying to access it from both my Andriod Galaxy S9 phone, my Fiance's Iphone XS, and the Amazon Alexa webapp. Can anyone shed some light on this and why the feature appears to no longer be available? Thanks"
"My father is a bit of an audiophile, and wants a good, high quality speaker, but my mother is adamant in wanting something that can be grouped in the multi room music option, so we can have the same music playing through alexa in the living room and the kitchen.  We were previously using just an Echo Dot connected via Aux cable to a better speaker, but the aux port on that speaker has started to fail. I thought it would be a good idea then to go and purchase a smart soundbar that was alexa compatible, since it seemed to me that would allow for multi-room music, so we bought a Sonos soundbar, but it doesn't seem the alexa app wants to recognize that as a speaker availabe for multiroom.   I'm worried that just returning the Sonos and buying a different brand will not resolve the issue, and with covid and everything going on rn it's very difficult to get ahold of my local Best Buy (that's about the only electronics store we've got around me), but without an actual person to talk to about this issue I'm pretty lost on what to do and/or look for  Does anyone have anything they can recommend that fits what I'm looking for?"
"This will probably sound like a dumb question but how can I remove someone else’s Echos from my Amazon account?  Basically I have set up family sharing with my mum so she can take advantage of Prime etc. The only problem is that all of her Echos are showing in my devices section in my app. Which means that when I make an announcement they all go off!  Also, slightly different, but does anyone know why my Hue Outdoor Lights are also showing as switches on the Alexa app???"
Is this a thing? Can it be a thing? If so let me know!  Needed for future man cave
"I have 9 echos all over the house, 5 of which are in different bedrooms. My alarm system and cameras will only allow one amazon account to access their features, therefore, all echos are tied to my account. However, I do have different locations defined for each echo. Is there a way for me to send an announcement or message to an individual echo within my household, without broadcasting to all other echos?"
"So today I bought an Echo Dot along with some of the Philips Hue stuff to get started with automating some things. My house is about to be renovated, but I want to test to see if everything I have is going to work the way I want it to. If I set it all up now, then take it all back out in a week will it still work when I put it all back?  Also any tips for setting everything up for when I do install everything? I want to learn as much as I can about this all.  &amp;#x200B;  (sorry about the ""*\*HELP\**"" I'm not completely used to Reddit and the other subs I've seen have flairs.)"
"The other night relaxing and watching some episodes of family guy that I had recorded, the episode in question where the school principal gets fired for fat shaming Chris, in the episode the principal asks ""Alexa play sad music"" at which point my echo at full volume at 1130pm blasted out some sad music and woke up half the street, yet my show 5 needs me to shout at it a command several times to get any acknowledgement"
"So  I have two echos plus in my bedroom, one black I call Mr Bed and one white I call Mrs bed, I have them setup as a speaker pair called Master Bedroom.  I have 3 ocean wave songs that are these scientifically mastered perfect sleeping sounds, each an hour long that I uploaded to amazon music back when we could do that so I'm grandfathered in to keep them.  I have a playlist called ocean waves which includes all 3.  I also have a routine called sleepy time which will play all three songs on a loop, it's really wonderful.   But here is the problem it only works correctly if I unpaired the two echo plus, and then it only plays on one of them.  When they are paired it will only play the first song and then stops.  Which means I wake up after an hour wondering where they ocean went.         I have tried everything I can think of including rebooting, deregistering, renaming, changing the routine wording order, tried using them as a speaker group instead of a pair, that didn't work either.  Nothing works except leaving them unpaired and only playing on one speaker which loses the whole 3D I'm on the ocean effect.   This community outreach is perhaps my last hope,  I am open to ideas!  Thanks for reading my sleepless plight."

"so recently I purchased 2 new 3rd gen Echo dots, one with clock and one without, previously id only had the second gen echo and the echo input never had an issue but with these new 3rd gen models I look over to find them each rebooting about 10-15 times a day and I just don't understand why. the input and the 2nd gen don't do this.  they're both located in the same large area, kitchen and living room. what the hell is going on?"
"Within the last few days, several of my smartbulbs no longer turn off or on only in my routines. I removed the lighting commands and re-added but  they still don't opperate within a routine.

Does anyone know of any work arounds to enable the use of an echo dot as a wired speaker using the 3.5mm audio jack on the back of the unit?
"Hey guys, my sister is worried bc she asked alexa to play a song and she responded with an emergency alert  saying there was a curfew to stay home or she will be detained if on the streets.   Has her alexa been hacked? Has anyone else experienced this?    Thanks!"
Currently have a few smart lights controlled by WeMo switches. They are set to go on/off at certain times of the day via the WeMo scheduler. Does Alexa have this ability? I want to move away from the WeMo platform.
"I bought a Tap dirt cheap on FB two days ago.  It costs 15 bucks.  It's in great shape.  I was buying it specifically to replace my Kitchen Echo.  Reason being, I have on in the Living Room and Family Room.  The kitchen is in between.  Don't need all three.  So I wanted to keep my kitchen filled with music and thought the Tap could be part of an audio group.  NOPE.  So, is there a device that is JUST a speaker for  music that works with Alexa Audio Groups?    Don't get me wrong, I love this Tap.  It's great.  Sounds good.  The charging dock and portability are awesome.  IDC that they're discontinued.  But aside from getting 3rd gen Dots and just muting them, I'd like to know if what I desire exists.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!"
"There surely must be a command to get Alexa to completely shut up? When in an app, if you say ""Alexa, stop"" it usually asks you if you are sure you want to quit, then it will say ok thank you for playing blah blah and then start bombarding you with app suggestions. Imagine I get an important phonecall, or I hear my son shouting for help somewhere in the house, I'm not going to be able to hear over Alexa repeatedly asking me if I'm sure I want to quit. Sure I could leave the room or walk over and unplug or turn the volume down, but the point of having Alexa is convenience, not added irritation. There surely must be some sort of all-stop command to get her to rapidly stfu.  TL:DR- Does Alexa have a sort of alt+f4 equivalent where you can make her quickly be quiet?  Thanks"
"I have a WiFi camera in my home that I have plugged into a smart plug, and I currently have an Alexa routine set up to use my phone’s location to turn the camera’s outlet on when I leave the house and turn it back off when I come back. However, this seems to be slightly unreliable as sometimes I need to turn the camera off manually.  Is there a way to have this triggered by my phone’s connection status to my home WiFi instead? Or if you have any other suggestions for how to accomplish this, I’d appreciate the help."
"Hi! I’ve posted this in r/lifx as well but thought I’d post here for more ideas.   So I have two Lifx mini A19s and they have been working fine up until now. I have an Alexa routine called Daylight, that when called, turns both lights to on, 100% brightness and “White”. This has not been working correctly recently. The lights have been increasing by what seems like 10% intervals in colour closer to what Is considered 100% brightness, and “white” from their precious state.   I’ve tried deleting the routine, recreating it, power cycling everything. Nothing seems to work. Any help appreciated :) thanks so much"
"After listening to the song I’ve asked for, Alexa stops.. is there a way for it to play another random song or whatever?  I noticed in the past that Google Home does it but not Alexa? Are my settings wrong or something?"
"Hello, I'm a very heavy sleeper and need a very loud alarm to wake me up in the morning. I was gifted an Echo Dot recently by a well intentioned family member, and use it to help me get to sleep, however, I'm trying to get it to wake me up as well. I know that traditional alarm volumes can be set on the app, however is there any way to change MUSIC alarm volumes? If I want to wake up in the morning to a different song each day is there any way that I can actually make it so that I, you know, WAKE UP? Alexa plays the music far to quietly for me to ever wake up."
"When setting up some routines I get the option to set a device that will respond ..

"Hey everyone, I just moved out of a place with 2 roommates into my own place. We were using my 3 echo dots in that house, but I brought them with me to this one. Never had any problems with any of them before.   I’ve been able to set up 2/3 just fine on the first try. The third one begins searching for WiFi and never stops, nothing comes up no matter how long I wait, and my only clickable option is to cancel setup.   I’ve reset my internet, reset the dot, and have tried multiple times with no luck. Anyone had this issue before?   Appreciate any and all help! Thanks!"
"I have not found any way to create a routine in Alexa which will play music while executing another task, for example playing music while opening drapes or curtains.    Just wondering whether anyone else has found a workaround with which to do this."

"So the internet stopped working in my area for some unknown reasons and after some hours, in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, at the LOUDEST VOLUME, alexa (which is in my bedroom) says: ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet.."" and something else..   I almost died!  Is this the best AI we can have in 2020? come on, if it is the middle of the night and NO ONE is talking to you, well my dear Alexa, SHUT UP!   (sorry if there are some typos, English is not my primary language)"
"Our echo dot will stutter in the middle of an answer and then just stop talking. This starts a silent period. It will sometimes show a circle of rotating blue and cyan. It lights up when we ask it a question and then go dark and not say anything. But when I go to the app, the activity shows an answer but it's not out loud. We've tried adjusting the volume, but that's not the issue. We can unplug it and plug it back in and it works for a day or a day and a half and then it does it again. Is it at the end of it's life or is there something we can do to reset it?   Thanks for any help you have."
Please post additional features you would like me to add to this skill in the replies below! Thanks!
"Is there a way to configure the news headlines shown on the Show?  They almost all seem to be about celebrity news (today is Bradley Walshs birthday - Why would I care, Alexa?).

"I have replaced my alexa (current model) with an show 8 in my living room. Because of my ring doorbell. I have an Logitech “Harmony” Hub and skill installed. I have used daily.

Has anyone experienced this and what is the solution.  Thanks!"
Main reason for this is that my grandparents are getting on and we feel they would benefit from not only the smart functions like light bulbs and plugs etc of Alexa but also for us to be able to drop in and make sure there ok or if they have a fall they can use Alexa to call us etc.   I was thinking   Amazon show 8 Blink mini camera Echo dot with clock for upstairs  Smart Phillips lightbulbs  TP link smart plugs   Suggestions please or any advice
"Recently, Alexa has begun requiring me to confirm that I want to turn on or off a Home device. For example, if I say “Alexa, turn on the bedroom light“, instead of just turning it on, it now responds with “you want me to turn on the bedroom light, right?“. Has anyone else noticed this change? Is there a way to go back to the earlier behavior?"
"In the past, as recently as yesterday, I have used my fire cube to set timers.    Somewhat more recently, the ability to interact with timers on other Echo devices was also implemented.

I did restart the device, but the issues persists.    Has anyone else experienced this, or something similar and would have an idea how to correct?"

Hello my Alexa used to be able to turn on and off my Ring floodlight but now states its on or off but does nothing. I can still ask it to turn it off and it says its off. But its not. Same thing within the app. It says its connected but doesn’t work.   Any ideas??  Thanks in advance.
"Hello everyone. I have started receiving delivery notifications the last couple of weeks and no packages delivered. We have been ordering quite a few things the last few weeks but we have nothing pending or awaiting arrival at the moment.  Typically we will get the notification then an hour or so later the notification is gone, I was waiting for the wife to get home one day when a notification came in and was waiting for her to get home is how I discovered they are going away. I received another notification today and I asked where's my package and the reply is "" I didn't find any open orders, you can check your orders page on amazon.com"" I logged into my acconut and I have no orders pending at all.  Anyone have any insight on this issue? Entire network has been rebooted and so on."
I have an echo dot and would like to be able to play music throughout my 3-story house.  What would be an economical way to accomplish this?    Is there a way to play through both an echo and an external speaker at the same time?  Or an echo dot and an echo flex?
"Hello, my wife just asked if it was possible to take a picture of a list (kids school supplies list in this case) and have that translate into a shopping list on Alexa.  I  know these things are possible, but I do not know if it can be done through Alexa.  Does anybody know of a feature or skill that does this?"
"Hey all,   I am really really confused I have about 3 routines that are deleted in my phone app but the dots and echos are STILL performing them.  How can I clear that out?  Thanks,   Andy"
"I have a Samsung tv connected to a fire tv cube. I’ve been able to turn the tv on and off perfectly fine until I connected a Samsung soundbar(not Alexa compatible) to the tv through an optic cable. Now that I have the soundbar, I can still turn the tv on by asking alexa, but when I try to turn it off, all it does is close whatever app is open, so it basically goes to the home screen. Anyone have an idea why?"
"Shot in the dark, but the kids saw a recipe for a marshmallow chocolate cake on Alexa at the beginning of quarantine as featured content, and they have been dying to make it.  We bought all the ingredients but stupidly didn't save the recipe.  It looked like a hasselback style cake, but it's not the one that's on there now if you ask for a hasselback cake.  Is there anyway to search for recipes where you actually watched the video for it on your device?"
"For Father’s Day, we got my grandpa an echo show so we can video call them, but when setting it up, she understood my grandpas voice but now she doesn’t. She hears mine just fine. Any suggestions?"

I have an echo and echo dot paired together and it works fine. When i use the alexa app to choose what i want to play everything works with them being paired. but when i use voice commands it only plays from one speaker and not paired up with the echo dot. Any suggestions on how to fix this?
"The directions online say to unlink with your Alexa app, but there is no option to unlink them. Please help!"

"So, just as the title says, she is telling me these things and it’s quite frustrating because I can’t figure out how to disable this feature. She says them at the same time each day, but I haven’t set any alarms or reminders for these things. I’ve tried “stop reminding me about dinner time” and she says “you have no reminders”. I’ve tried other variations of this but no luck. Does anybody know how to turn this off?"
"Noticed this yesterday, when I asked alexa to play a specific song, it said I needed music unlimited to do that. However I never needed that before. So slwhats up, it's the same thing today on my friends to. I have amazon prime. So what's up?"
"Hey all! I'm currently remodeling my bathroom and thinking of putting in some smart switches to control the exhaust fan and the lights. I'm running a Nexia thermostat bridge to control my smart stuff now but pretty much always use the Alexa app for device control and routines. I'm trying to figure out a way to do the following scenario (but of course having trouble): between 10pm and 6am, if the light switch is pushed on the lights will only turn on at 30% brightness. Any other time the light switch is turned on, the lights go to 100%. Adding to this, would like to have where the fan would turn on if the lights are on for more than 2 minutes.  Thank you in advance!"
So I bought a hamilton beach coffee maker with alexa enabled from their Canadian site. I go to add to devices and coffed maker is not listed as the instructions say it should be. I contacted manufacture and they say only works in the States. Is there anyway to make it work in Canada or do I have to return it? I tried changing my country in my Amazon account but still didn't work. I only use my dots to work my lights and blinds so doesn't matter too much if the temp and stuff isn't 100 percent. Coffee is way more important. Thanks
"Here's my setup. I have quite a few echo dots. Some are connected to receivers and power external speakers. I have created several speaker groups. I have sync'd my spotify account with my Alexa profile. All works great in that state.   &amp;#x200B;  I want to allow my wife to switch to her profile and play from her spotify when she wants. I have added her in the Amazon Household. When she loads up Alexa, she doesn't see any of the devices and can't send audio to them. How can I get this to work?"
"We have five Echos at our house, but the one we use the most, by far, is the Amazon Tap. Its portability means that it can go outside, in the garage, in the bathroom, any room that doesn't have a dedicated Echo. I can't believe that the Tap got discontinued.  If we had to replace the Tap, or get a second one, does anyone have a suggestion for a third-party alternative that does the same thing? Basically, what's the best portable Bluetooth speaker that has Alexa enabled on it?"
I'd rather get the dot if the only difference is the speaker

"tl;dr: You tell the device where you put things, then ask and the device recalls it for you. If someone makes this they will literally be a god in my eyes.  I came up with this idea, but have no idea how to put it into action. Basically you say ""Alexa, I put my wallet on my desk"" or something like that, and then you go about your life. Then, when you forgot where you put your stuff, you ask ""Alexa, where did I put my wallet?"" and then it responds ""You put your wallet on your desk.""  I don't have much experience coding in the languages that are used to make skills, and even then only have experience coding apps, but here's how I guess it would work:  The trigger phrase would be ""Alexa, I put my \*object\* \*location\*"" or even Alexa, my \*object\* is \*location\*"" then it would remember the object and the location, and when you give the recall trigger, ""Alexa, where did I put \*object\*?"", it finds the location that correlates to the object and relies ""You put \*object\* \*location\*.""  If you say the same object twice, it automatically replaces the older of the object's location with the newer one.  *Target audience:*  I have no idea if this is actually feasible, but i it is and somebody decides to go and make it, I want to give more info on who might actually use this.  I have ADHD and I know it would be a major help to those with ADHD who forget where they put things, as well as older people who forget where they put things. Let's face it, everyone forgets where they put things and I'm sure it would be quite a useful skill.  Thanks for hearing me out : )"
"Hello, I recently got an Echo Show, and my intention is to use (among other things) as an alarm-clock. I am currently using Google Routine on my phone, as it does exactly what I want:  1. Play spotify music as alarm. 2. On dismiss, tell me time, weather, commute, etc. 3. Play the news from my selected channels.  I am trying to do the same with Alexa now, but it doesn't seem to be possible. First of all, I've created a routine that plays when an alarm is turned off during the morning. It tells me the weather, time, and news from some place I can't customize.  Then I created an alarm, but it seems like Alexa doesn't support alarms that use Spotify, and instead you must select a preset sound, which I don't want.  Can you help me please? Thanks in advance."
"I have an echo show, a dot and a plug that I have a light plugged into it - this is account A. My boyfriend has a dot and a surge protector with a light plugged into it - this is account B.   We set up Amazon Household. When the devices are in account A, we can’t turn off the light in B. And I can’t see the light in the app (the one on the surge protector). I cannot turn the light on or off without switching accounts. When the devices are in account B, my boyfriend can’t see the light in A (the one on the plug). And we can’t turn off the light without switching.   Not having any luck searching online. Any suggestions?"
"Used to be able to say ""Turn off the lights,"" or just ""lights off"" and the Alexa would turn off all lights in the same room that the Alexa device was grouped into.  Or, ""turn off bedroom lights,"" for all the lights in the Bedroom group.  Or, ""turn off all the lights"" to turn off every light in the house.  Now when I say ""lights off,"" Alexa responds with ""A few things share the name 'lights,' which one did you want?""  Same with ""turn off bedroom lights.""  Though ""turn off all lights"" still works.  Really annoying!  Is there any way to fix this on my end?"
"So, I have 2 smart plugs, and a Fire TV Cube, in 3 different rooms, with 3 different devices (2 echos and the built in Cube Alexa). In Bedroom 1, ‘Turn on TV’ works, and always turns on the right TV (plug, obviously, called TV). In Bedroom 2, the same command just turns on the Cube TV. Each input is in their own group, associated with their own TV, so I’m not sure why 2 commands work differently on different echos. Any ideas?  Thank you!"
"-	I created a playlist called “Positive music” (Is that too generic?). -	I created a two seperate routines for the two echos in my house -	No matter what, both echo dots wont play my playlist  Any suggestions?"
"I used to have Spotify and there was an option when playing music to play it on available devices, one of which was the Alexa however with Apple Music the option is there but it only recognizes my smart tv. Is there a way to fix this?"
"After trying to create a sound group with Bose Soundtouch speakers that had a massive delay, I'm curious to see who actually has something that works.   Ideally, we'd like a soundbar and a couple speakers (all Alexa enabled) that can work with our Toshiba Fire TV, but it seems like there's a max of two devices (plus a sub, which we could care less about). Also frustrated that speakers need to be the same model, so we couldn't get an Echo Studio and supplement with a couple echo dots near our couch.  Thanks in advance for sharing your setups!"
"Opening the app fixes the issue obviously but this always happens when I'm out and about trying to change music, check shopping list, etc hands free and not use my phone cos coronavirus. Really irritating, anyone have a fix to keep the connection consistent?"
Yesterday our Echo show started announcing it's time to eat lunch at 3:30 PM and dinner at 10:00 PM. I keep googling how to solve this issue but can't find anything. How do I make it stop?
As soon as I say Alexa she immediately responds with “Something went wrong” before I can even ask or say a command. This happens frequently but not every time. Anyone else seeing this behavior?
"And so begins June! Lets start it off right. This week, Alexa shows off some new music features, a mystery story, and an interesting skill for gamers.

"Like others, I can't play music through Spotify, or Amazon Music. It's been a problem for weeks. For Spotify, it says the skill is not enabled, for Amazon Music it says ""can't find artist x"". When you try to reenable the Spotify skill, it says that it's not allowed in your region. This is apparently happening in both the US and Europe, which you can see on the latest reviews on the skill: https://www.amazon.com/Spotify/dp/B07FK56GVY   Here are two other threads showing Spotify has been disabled in Europe:   https://community.spotify.com/t5/Other-Partners-Web-Player-etc/Alexa-on-Echo-Dot-says-Spotify-not-currently-available-in-my/td-p/4908958  https://community.spotify.com/t5/Other-Partners-Web-Player-etc/Alexa-reports-Spotify-is-currently-not-available-in-your-region/td-p/4908586   I followed the advice in this recent thread and changed my region: https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/gjujgi/issues_with_spotify/   Word of warning: although this did work, it essentially reset Alexa. I have dozens of smart devices and had dozens of routines and alarms and I have to redo it all which will take quite a while. If you have Alexa set up just the way you like it....perhaps wait for an official fix.   Side benefit of changing regions: I can now use Alexa updates that were only available in the US, such as location-based routine triggers."
"Before I begin my rant, I should mention I did upgrade my router recently to a Asus AX-3000. As I was done with the free one provided by my ISP.  My internet performance as well as my stability with the new router has improved dramatically. So I wont be changing it.  I noticed the free router couldn't handle installing the amount of Lifx bulbs in my home.  I have a dozen or so connected.  So I needed a better router to handle that many devices.  However, over time I've noticed Alexa is getting increasing dumber with her voice commands.  She frustrates me how precise I need to be when controlling my lights brightness with finishing my command with 100% 90% etc... I use to just say raise brightness of a exact device or the room I categorized the lights in.  Now I noticed my custom routines aren't completely changing my lights colors over to my desired setting.  They tend to get stuck on the previous color and only adjust my requested brightness within the routine.  But if I make a voice command to each device separately, they do switch to my desired color.  I can't believe I have to make meta changes to my routines just to get my lights to do what they've been capable of doing for almost 2 years regardless of which router the lights were on.  TL;DR: Lights don't change as intended with Alexa Routines. Need suggestions to fix."
"So I have two Alexa devices. One is associated with my amazon prime account, which is the primary account in our household. The second device is associated with my girlfriend's account, which is an additional adult account in our household. When I ask alexa to play specific songs which are included in amazon prime music, I'm able to successfully do it. When I ask my girlfriend's alexa to play those same songs, I get the message that we can only play stations and need to upgrade to play specific songs. Neither one of us has amazon music unlimited. Why the difference? We share a Prime account household, but we are temporarily long distance so we have different echos. Anyone have any insight?"
Have had it for a couple years and it's the first time it ever happened.  Thoughts?
"Hi, all! I have some lightbulbs in my bedroom set up with my Alexa account. Each is named left and right and they’re both grouped into “lights.” I say to Alexa to turn them off and it turns off my fan off and lamp too. How do I stop that?  Everything else is named “fan” and “lamp,” so I don’t know where it’s getting confused.   Thanks!!"
"Is it possible to have two Alexa devices, each with their own amazon account, on the same network?  The reasoning being that I want to separate my bedroom echo show and smart lights from the rest of my family and the home."
"I have a Fire TV Cube in my bedroom. I found it very useful for setting quick alarms, laundry timers, etc., but recently, this feature has stopped working. now, when I ask Alexa to set an alarm or timer, she replies ""\[alarms/timers\] are not currently supported on this device."" setting an alarm or timer on the app on my phone (and marking it to ring through my Fire TV Cube) does not work. I have power cycled my device several times and checked for software updates, to no avail. any insight is appreciated!"
"I understood that you could say Alexa send text and she could send a text or SMS to anyone in your contacts list, buy it doesn't work.   She asks to whom, I tell her a name in my contacts list and she says they need to be registered (?) and to see the app for who is.  I cannot see anything in the app about registered or registering, or even what for? Surely she should just send a text to a contact??"

Not sure if this is possible I'd assume this is what groups are for but that doesn't seem to be the case. I have 2x 2nd gen echo dots echo each grouped with a plug the lamps are attached to in their respective rooms. When I ask it to turn the lights on and off I need to specify the room they are in. What I'd like is if you tell the echo to 'turn off the lights' it turn the one off it is in the group with and not have to be specific with it's name. Can that be done?  Thanks
"Hey, I’m trying to set up a power nap routine where I tell Alexa “Power Nap”, and it starts an alarm for 20 minutes, shuts off my lights, plays lofi music on 1 volume, then like 2-3 min before the 20 min mark slowly ramp up my brightness on my lights, go to 5-6 volume, and play the alarm sound, while stopping the music.

That was all sorted, and Amazon arranged a free replacement to be delivered.   So the replacement Echo Dot was delivered today, and I have to say, I’m shocked. The Dot arrived half-heartedly packaged in a loose generic cardboard box, and when I unpacked it, I noticed that the fabric was stained on the side, and there was a chip on the top of it. Also, when compared to my previous Dot, I noticed that the sticker with the serial number was missing from the base.   I have to say, this new echo is in shit condition compared to my old one - which was only 3 months old. What do I do? Can I decline this new Echo because it isn’t in good enough shape? Any suggestions much appreciated..."

"With May nearing its end, it's time to review what Amazon newly-promoted for Alexa commands. Collectively, there are 82 total features to try out. While that number alone may sound daunting, I’ve compiled a few of my favorite commands in the below roundup.   [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/alexa-tips-and-tricks-may-2020/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/alexa-tips-and-tricks-may-2020/)   Think I've missed any? Would love your thoughts on if you found other cool Alexa commands from this month too."

"We have reminders set up at various times of day for medication and chores.   I am wondering if there is a way to modify them to a format like this:   ""Jane, did you take your morning medicine?""    If Jane answers ""yes"", Alexa responds: ""Good work, Jane!""   If Jane answers ""no"" or is silent, Alexa responds: ""OK I will remind you again in an hour.""   And she does.   I am thinking that if this is possible, I would have to use Routines instead of Reminders.   But is this possible?   If so, any suggestions are to how to set them up?   If not possible as a Routine, what about as a Skill?"
"I tried using the Amazon Dash Wand today for the first time in awhile, and whenever I push the button on my Amazon Dash Wand, Alexa says, ""I'm a little tired right now.  Can you let me rest for a minute?""  I thought resetting it and going through the setup process might fix whatever is wrong, but [Amazon's Dash Wand setup instructions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202084170) don't seem to work: going to amazon.com/wandsetup on an Android device launches the Amazon shopping app with a blank screen.  The manual instructions (Menu &gt; Your Account &gt; Dash Buttons &amp; Devices) are no longer applicable since the Dash Buttons have been discontinued, so that no longer exists.  Was the Dash Wand discontinued when the Dash Buttons were discontinued?"
Does anyone know how to play a song from a specific time to play a certain window of music and not from the beginning?
"As it is we can easily ask what the temperature is and it will give us a reading from the nearest official weather station.  The thing is because of where my home is and how it is situated my temp here can be different enough.  So is there an outdoor thermometer that is Alexa enabled?  When I did some searches I found plenty of weather stations that were not Alexa enabled, several indoor only ones that were Alexa enabled, and some that said they had the capability but also seemed to indicate they did a lot of other things and weren't very expensive which to me is a big red flag.  So is there anything people have used that will tell you what the weather is like outside and have it integrate with Alexa so I can simply ask for the temp and know it is accurate for outside of my home?"
"I just got my Echo Dot yesterday. When I shuffle my Apple Music playlist, it only shuffles the order of the 20 first songs of the playlist or so, which is very inconvenient, since my playlist is extremely long. Is there a way to properly shuffle a long playlist or it simply doesn’t work as intended?"
"I have 4 echo's in my house. The downstairs unit has trouble keeping connected to my Xfinity wifi. The signal is week. I am thinking of getting the Xfinity pod signal extenders. if anyone has done this please answer the following:  1. Do the extenders create a separate wifi signal, or just boost the existing network. in other words, will I have to reset Alexa to a separate network? \[In past houses I used 3rd part extenders, they created a separate wifi network.\] 2. If so, can I somehow conjoin the two systems"
"To save money, I'm thinking of unsubscribing from Amazon music and switching to iTunes/Apple Music, since the rest of the family uses it (I have an Android phone and they have iphones.)  Will I have a problem with Alexa playing Apple Music? Heck, can I make playlists on Apple?  Thoughts/ideas/advice?? Thank you!"

"hi. i know this is an age-old question, but i have been searching diligently for over an hour and still cannot figure it out. we have someone moving in with us. i would like for certain routines (specifically, ""good night"" and ""good morning"") to be situation specific. two options: 1/ voice specific, so if person1 says ""alexa, good night"", the master bedroom lights turn off. if person2 says ""alexa, good night,"" then the child bedroom lights would turn off. alternatively, this could also be location or device specific (so in master bedroom or child bedroom) but it seems like routines cannot be alexa-device specific."
Last I saw this posted was in 2017 so just FYI for all unless I was blind.  https://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#cards  I hate using my phone for automation and task setup.
"I woke up today and she no longer controls my light bulb. Everything looks the same in the apps etc, even the routeens that operate the light have no effect. Any suggestions on how to remedy this?"
Does anyone know if you can customise your Echo shows home screen to perhaps have shortcuts to start a routine or control a smart home device without having to go into the control section? I don’t know why amazon wouldn’t utilise the touch screen on their devices more and allow you to have more customisation.
"I said goodnight to my Alexa in my room and she said upstairs, “goodnight and here you go.” And then proceeded to play music. There is no way she heard me up there because she didn’t respond down here. They are no on the same account. It was extremely freaky."
"I’d like to be able to set up Alexa to tell me current stock market data for specific stocks with one phrase like, “Alexa, how are my stocks?” Is this possible with any skills?"
"I've been having an issue with my Echo Dot's lately, when I ask Alexa to play my Liked Songs or My Music on Spotify, she'll reply saying ""Now playing your Liked Songs on Spotify"" and then just start playing random music that isn't in any playlist I have. I'm not sure when this started.  But my Liked Songs play fine if I do it manually from the desktop app or my android phone... I don't get it.  Does this have anything to do with not having Premium?"
"**Me:** ""Alexa, what is the purpose of Memorial Day?""   **Alexa:** ""The purpose of Memorial Day is Memorial Day.""  Ah, gotcha. And here I was thinking it was Rosh Hashanah  **Me:** ""Hey Google, what is the purpose of Memorial Day?""   **Google Assistant:** ""...Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday of May. It was formerly known as Decoration Day and commemorates all men and women who have died in military service for the United States.""  I'd chuckle if this was a one-off misfire. Instead, it's one more reason on a growing pile of frustrations that have me using my Echos/Dots less and my Google Homies more.  Alexa has gradually felt more like abandonware vs. a growing Echo-system over the past year or so."

"I purchased an Echo Show for my mother for its drop-in feature. Not long after, I decided to get one for myself for easier calling.   I'm trying to configure everything before I send hers to her and I'm having this issue where I can call my mother's Echo Show no problem but I can't call mine from hers. Her calls automatically go to the Alexa app on my phone instead of the echo   Any ideas what might be happening here?  Thanks for any advice you can lend."
"Alexa arrived today. Kids all excited.... They just want to hear her fart. Have set it all up. She adds things to the shopping list, she plays tunes, the lot. She just responds with ""I don't have an answer for that"" when I ask her to fart, burp, flatter me etc (the usual funny requests). My voice recognition is set up, I look through my history and she understands what I'm saying. For the life of me I cannot get her to fart etc. Kids (and me) very disappointed..... 4 friends of mine all got the dot recently and they've no such issues. They just say ""Alexa, fart"" and off she blares. (cannot find fixes online or on reddit forums for this specific issue)   Any tips?!"
Is there a way for Alexa to just play the notification sound when the doorbell is pressed and not say someone is at your front door after the notification sound?
I have 2 WiFi networks: my main one and a guest network. I used to have my 2 echo dots on the main network but I've since switched them to the guest network. The problem I'm having is that every couple of days one of the echo dots will switch back to the main network. I wouldn't care if it weren't for the fact that multi-room music requires connected speakers to be on the same network.   Is a factory reset going to be necessary to stop echo dots from switching between WiFi networks on their own?
"I have a large great room with an echo cube set up to control my home theater, TV, Receiver, Satellite, PS4, as well as lights and its often tough to yell all the way across the room, especially if loud music is playing.  My initial solution was to buy a couple a echo flexes to place around the room, however, even after adding them to the ""Living room"" group, they constantly tell me they can't complete my commands such as playing music or turning devices on or off.  They will turn the volume of the receiver up and down though and turn lights on and off.  This is frustrating because I'll be in the kitchen and ask alexa to play some music, but the flex will say can't do that and fail.  Anyone know of a solution to this?"
We currently have a lot of echos around the house. We have two separate accounts on the same household ; each with two separate Spotify accounts. To play music on a group of speakers we currently have to switch each one individually the same account. Is there a way to switch a group of echos or all of them to the same account ? Eg “Alexa switch accounts in the downstairs group” or “Alexa switch accounts on all devices”
"My end goal is to have my personally owned music play on shuffle on my Echo.   From what I understand you could previously upload your own music to Amazon music, but from what I’ve seen that’s no longer possible. I had this type of thing working with Google Play Music.  I can connect my phone via Bluetooth and play my music that way, but that requires the use of my phone which sort of defeats the point of a voice controlled device  So, is there a work around? Maybe a routine that does something like:  “Alexa, *PHRASE*”  1. Connect to phone via bluetooth  2. Play music from phone"
"If I buy a smart device , say an LED bulb, that is compatible with alexa. Then do I need to buy an echo device to control it . Or can I just use the alexa app on my phone to do the same?"
"I really enjoy sleeping to certain skill app sounds but I've found that after an hour on the echo show it will stop. However, on my echo dot the skill looped perfectly every night. Now, however, with the echo show 8 It seems that the sound will only loop for an hour and I'm not sure why when other sound skill apps will. The sound is Sleep sounds Eternity Sounds and I really like it but no matter what I say Alexa refuses to loop it on echo show 8. Am I just being stupid or is it due to not all skills work correctly on the echo shows?"
Hi r/alexa  Frist some background. I have few Dots scattered around house na Show in kitchen and I'm planing to buy Echo Plus. Here is my question: how does hub stack compared to dedicated hubs? How good is compatibility and how good it works compared to for example Hue hub? From what I read on Philipes site Hue has broder functionality when connected to dedicated hub. General the question come down to should I buy Echo Plus or go with dedicated hubs.  PS. Hue is an example. I didn't decide with what system I will go.
"I have three echo dots, and Spotify premium with one playlist I’ve created. Whenever I ask Alexa to play that playlist, she says she can’t find it. The playlist is called Tiger Queen. I’ve got Spotify as my default music service. I’ve unlinked and relinked Spotify. I’ve changed my playlist name and changed it back. I’ve tried saying ‘Alexa, play Tiger Queen’, ‘Alexa, play Tiger Queen playlist’, and various other versions, both with and without ‘on Spotify’ being said.  I’m in Australia.  Can anyone help?!"

"We ask Alexa questions every day but are literally never interested in the additional topics she often proposes.  If I ask the age of a politician or celebrity, I *never* also want to know his net worth. If I ask for today's weather, I rarely if ever want the rundown on tomorrow's. The delays and interruptions these tangents create are annoying. Often we're also having a separate conversation (with humans) but must wait til Alexa clams up in order to continue.  I'll grant, there may be Alexa owners so lonely that they like the illusion of having a companion, but that's not the case in this household. Is there a setting to stop this?"
"Here is what I have:  * MASTER BEDROOM sonos playbar with symfonisk lamps for surround sound (with smart bulbs), echo dot, vizio tv, ceiling fan with three smart bulbs * DINING ROOM ceiling fan with three smart bulbs, vizio TV, ecobee 4, (probably will get sonos beam) * LIVING ROOM two ceiling fans each with three bulbs, vizio TV, sonos playbar with symfonisk lamps for surround sound (with smart bulbs), Xbox One X, PS4 Pro, echo dot * RIGHT BEDROOM ceiling fan with three smart bulbs, sonos beam * LEFT BEDROOM ceiling fan with three smart bulbs, echo dot * SPARE BEDROOM ceiling fan with three smart bulbs, vizio TV, PS4 Pro, sonos beam  Pretty much right now I have it set to be able to control the lights in every room. Also now in the living room and in my bedroom I have it set for ""Alexa, let's watch TV in the (bedroom/living room)"" and it cuts the main lights out and dims the surround sound lamps to 25%. When I say ""Alexa, good night"" she shuts off everything in the bedroom.  I can't help but think there is so much more I can be doing but I just don't know what that is. I would appreciate any ideas and input."
"1. Stay in the same ecosystem as much as possible 1. The Amazon Echo Dot, Amazon Fire 7 tablet and Amazon Switch are under $50 each. Just saying. 1. The three amigos (Dot, Switch and Tablet) are a good start, IMO 1. LIFX bulbs are the top of the line, and their app is directly compatible with the $50 fire7 tablet (important) 1. LIFX has a $20 mini white bulb (also important)  1. Philips Hue bulbs require an app that is NOT native to the Fire 7 tablet  1. Lutron makes a high end (yet inexpensive) smart dimmer kit 1. The Lutron app is directly fire 7 compatible 1. Lutron Dimmers and Hunter ceiling fans do NOT get along. It's a fire hazard. 1. Many ""smart devices"" have apps that require the latest Mac OS or the latest Android OS - which you might *not* have. 3rd gen iPad? Too bad, you are SOL. Hence, the Amazon Fire 7 tablet for $50.  1. Most Hubs can be OPTIONAL if you are careful 1. Most smart bulbs have a medium-sized base. If you have a ceiling fan with candleabra-sized bulbs, there's a converter between the two sizes that sells for about $2 at Home Depot. Note that the converter is ONLY for low wattage bulbs. Don't burn your house down! (*sniff* What's that burning smell?) 1. Bose speakers are Alexa-compatible, as is their app. I had to activate both the soundtouch skill and the bose skill.  1. A lot of devices phone home. that's just the way that it is 1. LIFX bulbs can be reset by turning them off and on five times repetitively.  1. Routines compliment alarms. You can wake up to an alarm, while a complimentary routine turns on the lights 1. Fans virtually cry out for a voice-activated Amazon switch. I'm in SoCal, it will be 90+ degrees tomorrow. *Alexa, fans on*. 1. The Bose Soundtouch 10 speaker may hook up to the Echo Dot over Bluetooth as-is, but you'll be lots happier if you upgrade the firmware in the speaker and get the Bose app software. 1. Downloading the Bose software and such was NOT painless (but it did work. Eventually). 1. Many vendors' so-called ""support"" websites are far from helpful, as they are idiots, but persevere and you'll probably figure it out.  I'm not sure what else to add.   My current setup is an Echo Dot, five Amazon Switches, a Bose soundtouch 10 and two of the finest LIFX bulbs. Later in the week, I am adding four LIFX mini white bulbs. I am operating lights, fans and a speaker. Oh - I feel that Amazon Music is worth the $10. I listened to the ""Battle of the Planets"" theme song about a dozen times today. Good times."
"This started a few nights ago, but the echo door in our bedroom lights up, the ring spins for a minute or so, it dims down for another 10/15 seconds and goes off.  Since we’re trying to sleep there has been no awake word spoken, plus the spot is set up to enter so not disturb at 19.30.  There’s nothing in the logs so no idea what it’s doing but it keeps waking me up and it’s infuriated my wife as well.  Any ideas?"

I currently use smart plugs in a routine to turn on and off Wansview cameras when I need to because the Wansview cameras themselves don’t integrate with Alexa routines.

Preferably on the cheaper end.    Thanks in advance 👍
"As the title says, I decided to mess around with Alexa. I like her so far, but... I really really really don't want my parents to see my reminders and all that. Even if they can't, I just don't feel comfortable having all of our devices linked like this. Is there any way to not allow device sharing like this and maintain amazon prime status on my account?  Also, is there a way to EDIT recent reminders? With Google Assistant I can easily reschedule a reminder that I had missed / wasn't able to do for another day, but I haven't found a way to do that with Alexa and it's honestly kind of annoying."
"Hello there, I think this would be a pretty common discussion but I haven't found an answer that satisfies me on Google. I came across a few suggestions, and so far the best one was this:  [https://voicebrew.com/voicebrew-22/](https://voicebrew.com/voicebrew-22/)   I like the idea of a smart assistant, but still find little use for it on a daily basis, and would like to power up my utilization of this device. I currently own a dot, which I installed in the bathroom. It basically plays music for me and tells me the news in the morning, or the weather before I go out. Now I just bought a Show (the one with a screen) to place it at the bedroom, with the intention to use it as alarm as well as play music in my bedroom and the tasks that the Google routine has been doing for me on the phone.  However, I can't really find other daily uses that I want to do. I'm not currently interested in easter eggs, such as Star Trek's ""Computer"", or some snide question that's bleeped out, or Chuck Norris' facts, which are fun for a few minutes, but after that they are forgotten.  To put it simple, I'm looking for ideas on stuff I could do normally to start using it a bit more, because my creativity doesn't really go beyond ""Alexa, play music"" or ""Alexa, what's the weather like today"". I'm looking for those hidden gems that are probably there, but I never knew about. Like when I explained to my mother that she could watch TV on the internet through Netflix and she had no clue until then.  Also sorry if this has been debated to death, I certainly can't find an answer that covers what I really want."

I know this is super cheesy, but I am going on a road trip and I want to talk to my cats in my room just so they know I didn't disappear ( I have family feeding them) Its mostly to make myself feel better because I am aware they most likely could care less after a few days.

"I have multiple echo devices throughout my fairly small apartment. I have two set up as a pair in my bedroom. I have two in my living room not as a pair, one in my office, one in my kitchen which happens to be a show. My question, should they all have the same wake word? Right now I thought different wake words were the way to go, but now I’m not so sure. My bedroom pair, one is “echo“ and one is “Alexa“, for example. But now I’m wondering if I should just keep everything one wake word throughout my place, including my tablet. It’s confusing having different words all over! Can I assume that if I use just one word, like “Alexa” for all devices, the one closest in earshot would answer? Is there any reason not to do this? I thank you for your input!"

"Is anyone else having an issue where Alexa is reading your Kindle book just fine --- for about 10-15 minutes, then she starts over where she originally started ... and then she does it again and again?  I haven't seen any posts online about this.  But since it has happened on at least three of my devices and using multiple Kindle books I suspect someone else has this problem too?  I wrote Amazon about it -- they told me to do all the stuff I already told them I did (choose another device, choose another book, etc. etc.)  But nothing works.  Still looping.

"Hello!  I have seven 2nd-generation Echo Dots in my home and about half of these are connected to a Bluetooth speaker (all are connected to the same make/model of speaker, which is a ""Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, made by Cambridge SoundWorks).  I have had no issues using my Echo Dots in multi-room music groups whilst connected to Bluetooth speakers at all, for the past year or so.  Some of the speakers have latency issues/lag, but this was easily fixed with the speaker synchronization feature within the Alexa App, in the settings for Multi-Room music groups.  Today however, one individual Echo Dot goes silent when I ask Alexa to play music on a multi-room music group of which that Dot is a member of.  All the other Dots/BT speakers play fine, but that one speaker is silent.  All dots have the latest firmware, are on the same network, have excellent WiFi signal, etc.  I've hard-reset the Dot, have deleted and recreated the Multi-Room Music Group and have added the Dot back again and it still won't play.  When I called Amazon tech support (well, they called me after I'd been on the chat feature with two different associates - you still can't directly call them), I was surprised when the associate told me that multi-room music does not support Bluetooth speakers and that has never been a feature, and that it was only a feature for Sonos speakers because they'd specifically designed mutli-room music to work with Sonos but that in her 2.5 years at Amazon she'd never heard of anyone ever being able to play multi-room music via Echo Dots connected to Bluetooth speakers. This was news to me - why is there even a speaker synchronization feature in the Alexa app then?  They sole purpose of that feature is for Bluetooth speakers, to correct latency issues.  And why are my other Echo Dots working just fine with Bluetooth speakers and multi-room music?  Also, I shared with them this post which shows their own update release information which shows multi-room music does now work with Bluetooth speakers.  Does anyone else have any issues with their multi-room music &amp; Bluetooth speakers?  This is clearly a feature and has been for over a year now.  I found it very strange to be told it has never been a feature.  She checked with her engineering/tech team and they said the same thing - that it's not a feature.  But it is a feature, in the US anyway, and has been since October 2018..."
I have a set of lights in my kitchen that are on a double pole switch and one on a single pole.  The single pole has a HUE bulb that will not sync.

Using spotify on “everywhere” between two Alexa units there is a few second gal between tracks on Spotify.

I’ve been wracking my brain trying to think of a good way to secure it, but I’m still drawing blanks. The best I could come up with was a smart plug that shuts the device off at night or when I go away. But I feel like there should be a better way. Does anyone have any ideas?"
"I have about 50 devices in the Alexa app that are mostly connected via smartthings integration. About 15 of them randomly started showing up as ""Server is Unresponsive"". I cannot manually control the devices in the Alexa app, but I can control them via voice commands and they are still manually controllable via Smartthing app. I've not seen this message happen before. I've see Device Unresponsive and usually it will connect eventually or I can rediscover the device."
"my answer: Suzanne  reason:  most women with that first name are 60 or more years old now.  Younger generations aren't expected to bear any name of the Suz&amp; name seires (e.g. Susan, Susannah, Suzette, Susie, etc.) these days, so I say we might as well use any Suz&amp; series name as an alias for the Alexa device since I don't expect to encounter anybody whose human with Suz&amp; series names in any room with an Alexa device in this day and age.  so instead of say:  Alexa, play Tom's Diner.  you (or should I say, I) can say:  Suzanne, play Tom's Diner.  but I don't expect to do that until a new version of Alexa allows for aliases like these.  So, what would your choice of alias for voice commanding the device be if you had the option to choose a name outside of the Alex- prefix name series?  I know there are names outside of the Suz&amp; name series to try out as well.  There's also the idea of choosing names of the Juli&amp; name series as well, or etc."
Is anyone else having troubles with Alexa not understanding simple voice commands after adding their Eeros?   No when I ask Alexa to “Turn the living room lights on”  She says “ok here’s eero....sorry I could find a eero device....”  I just wanted my lights to turn on.
"I have Siri on my phone, who makes phone calls for me, Google to turn my lamp on with a smart plug &amp;   Now maybe Alexa to buy me my soap 😂  Damn I thought I’d only be using one of these AI voice assistants, looks like all 3 maybe joining the party."
"Opened the app to sort some light routines out and now we can order our routines by a filter ; date created, device etc. Any other new features added in that I can’t see ?"
"Alexa keeps asking my name. I assume this is partly to ensure that account settings are set properly for different people.  I haven't told her or my girlfriend's name because one of the main things we do with Alexa is share a shopping list - that way she can add something to my shopping list by telling Alexa to put something we need on it.  If I tell Alex our names is a side effect going to be that we have different shopping lists?  Thanks, wasn't able to find anything about this because as soon as you talk about ""name"" and ""Alexa"" to Google it's all news articles about how annoyed people named Alexa are, and questions about how you can rename your Alexa."
"Hi,  I was wondering if it was possible to ask Alexa to ""Turn on the A/C for one hour"". I currently plugged my A/C in a smart plug so I can turn it on/off with Alexa. However, I want to be able to turn it on only for 1 hour with Alexa during the middle of the night for example. I can't seem to figure it out with a routine.  I'm using the app ""Smart Life"" with my smart plug which allows me to put a timer or a schedule but I'd like to do it with my voice instead of via the app.  Thanks!"
"TL;DR - Is there a better option for managing a 2 account household than ditching one account and moving everything to one account?  ---  I've read through the sub, and it looks like a lot of people have the same problem I have. What I'm looking for now is advice from anyone that's gone through this for how to best move ahead.  My wife and I both have our own Amazon accounts. My account is where the home automation is all set up, and I manage devices as they're added, moved, and reconfigured, and set up the routines. My wife's account has our Prime membership, Audible membership, and Amazon Music. Because the home automation is all set up under me, when we're in her account, it knows nothing of most of the devices in the house. It can use them from routines, but cannot do anything with them otherwise nor set up routines herself in the few occasions when she wants to do that.   Right now, the best solution I've found is to just collapse our Amazon accounts back down and run it all from her account. I would log out of Alexa on my phone and log in with her credentials and then my account would be for personal Amazon purchases only.   I sort of hate that idea - I work in software and shared accounts are a security headache - but I don't see another way to consolidate the management of our house.   Has anyone else gone through this that can share their experiences? Is the single account idea the best option I have?"
I was messing around and her response made me laugh
I'm asking this because I like to call Alexa a bitch and it drives my girlfriend crazy. I'm wondering if there's any way I can get her to respond to hey bitch.   Sorry quarantine and weed got me thinking some weird shit.
I recently bought the flex and the motion detector for it. Set it up with a routine for when you walk into the room the lights come on and after X amount of minutes the lights turn off...well it worked fine for about 2 days and now I cannot get it to detect motion. Does anyone know how to fix this or did I just buy a dud?
"Hi there,  When I tell Alexa to play Spotify´s Discover Weekly, Release Radar, My Daily Mix, etc... Alexa says that doesn't find those playlist. Could the issue be that my Spotify Premium account is Spanish and my Alexa/amazon account is UK?  With Google Home Mini works just fine.  Many thanks in advance."
Has anyone been able to use the Fyrtur IKEA blinds with Alexa but without the IKEA hub?  An IKEA employee ensured us that we didn't have to buy it since it's all zigbee and that it was only necessary at the launch of the IKEA blinds.  But after trying for a solid two hours I couldn't figure it out.   Any help is most welcome!
She has apparently been sleeping in my mom's room for weeks because she's terrified of sleeping alone now. Thought you guys would find that funny.
"Already have a couple of dots and a Show 8 and half a dozen Bluetooth hue bulbs which all work nicely.  Just bought the Echo Plus 2nd gen on sale. Given it has Zigbee, will it now default to using Zigbee rather than Bluetooth by itself? It came with an older Hue non-Bluetooth bulb so it will have to be using its hub to run that one at least.   Just curious as I’m not setting them all up from scratch, hope I don’t need to re install everything? 😬"
"Hi fellow smart nerds,  So i'm working with the Alexa routines and one of them is to turn on the lights at sunset. But when i'm not home it still triggers (which is obvious ofcourse). I can't seem to find a way to make it so that this specific routine only triggers when i'm on/around the property. Is there a way to fix this within or outside the Alexa skillset?  Kind regards,  Robert"
"I have a wired set of outdoor speakers and subwoofer, controlled by an amplifier indoors. I’ve seen devices like AudioCast that I can connect to my system inside, and control via my phone, but no way to just talk to it.   How can I use Alexa from the pool to control the audio on my system. Pool is a good distance from the house (40ft), no issue with WiFi, strong signal by the pool.   I’d like to be in the pool and change the music without using my phone. I have a couple echo dots, can I tell one to talk to the other? I can easily put a dot on my system inside, but how do I communicate to it from outside? I can’t use the remote, it’s Bluetooth and too far away to use. I don’t mind using my phone, but also want to do it by voice. I’ve been searching but I’m stumped how to make it work. Help!"
"so at around 3 am, i decided to play some music to fall asleep to. at one point i asked it to restart a certain song. my alexa misinterpreted it as resume which caused it to play Metallica on all devices (one in the kitchen, living room, and my sisters room) i was scared my parents were gonna wake up, so i quickly dash up, to unplug all the devices in the house, so, my question is, is there a way for the alexas to NOT play music when you say resume? (besides unplugging them all) like a setting on the alexa app"
"How come I cannot use a command like ""Alexa, baby monitor"" to have my echo show open the cloud can and watch it?  I have a bunch of different cameras and I can understand why some don't work. But not the cloud cam?"
Does anybody know how I can make a echo dot type thing with a Bluetooth speaker and an iPhone 5 or an old computer? Or if you have another way
I have an Alexa and I was wondering if I could somehow put google assistant on it or agleast put the voice that the google home uses or agleast our alexas search engine as google and not bing. I doubt I can do this but if you know of any way I can I want to wake Alexa by saying hey google it ok google.
"who broke who? do i post r/alexa or r/xboxone  been using alexa + OTA TV Tuner on Xbox FLAWLESSLY for quite a while.  alexa open one guide -&gt; broken  alexa watch NBC -&gt; changes the channel and always goes to TV/Cable setup  I can turn tv on/off, mute, volume still via alexa.  anyone else?"
"I think I understand where the problem might be coming from, but dont know how to fix it. Normally saying turn on the lights will work as inteded and sometimes I get the message ""a few things share the name lights. Which one do you want?"" (I'm paraphrasing the last sentence). Sometimes I'm able to reply ""living room lights"" and it will turn the living room lights on. Most of the time it doesn't matter what I say. She'll ask which one do I want, not understand the answer, and ask me again. If she doesn't understand the answer twice, she says to try again later. Im still able to control the lights with the hue app and the voice commands work again after a few minutes.  The way I have my lights set up might be the problem. I have 2 bulbs in a group called living room lights, 2 bulbs in the kitchen in the group kitchen lights, and 1 bulb in the bedroom called bedroom lights. Then I have the groups ""living room"" and ""kitchen"" in a zone (unsure on the vernacular) called ""the lights"". That way I'm able to turn all of the lights expect for the bedroom on by saying ""turn on the lights"". I dont know if alexa is confusing the zone ""the lights"" with a command to turn on all of the lights on including the bedroom, but i felt it was worth noting.  Has anyone experienced something like this or heard that command before?"
"This is a little convoluted, and I'm not sure if I've just got so many devices my whole house is confused, or if there's a specific order I need to be doing something to get everything to work properly.  So... we have numerous Echo devices around the house - an original Echo Show in the living room, another one in my office, a 5"" Show as my alarm clock, an Echo Spot as my wife's alarm clock, and several Echo Dots in different rooms, mainly for playing music and controlling Hue Lights.  We also bought a Fire TV Cube for my son's room a few months ago.  He had a Fire TV stick for a while, but it started slowing down to a frustrating degree, and the Cube seemed like a decent upgrade to make it so that it was completely voice responsive without having to pick up the remote and press the button all the time.  However, at that point we noticed the Harmony hub in the living room would no longer control the entertainment center (Xbox One + AV Receiver + TV).  I didn't really put two and two together until some time later, and only just now took some time to try and figure it out.  I went into my Alexa control panel, forgot all the existing devices, and re-discovered everything.  Miraculously the living room Echo Show began controlling the entertainment center through the Harmony remote again.  But the Cube in my son's room would not control his TV any more, instead it was now telling Harmony to turn off the TV in the living room.  So, am I doomed to not get this working as intended, or is there a way to ""dedicate"" certain skills or smart home devices to specific Alexa devices?   Like, can I set it up so that the Cube only ever tries to control the TV it's physically connected to, or get rid of the Harmony skill on only the Cube so it can't try to control the living room TV, or arrange things into ""rooms"" so that Alexa devices will only control devices in that ""room""?  The last would probably have other implications, like not being able to control Hue lights in other parts of the house, which would also be a bummer."
So I’m a new owner of echo devices. She says she knows me. I came home from work and asked her to play some music without checking if it was my wife’s profile or mine. It started up my wife’s Spotify. Shouldn’t it have started mine regardless of which account it was on?
"I visited my mother on mothers day and commented on how cool her Show 5 was, so she surprised me with one. Was very cool of her.  After some slight scandal with it being a stolen Show and a replacement issued, I've got it all set up and I've got multiple Echos throughout my apartment. What I'm looking for is any cool things that I can do with it. Clever things that people don't normally know about.  Additionally, here are some things I'd like to be able to do:  -I'd like the background to scroll a slideshow of pictures of my choosing. So far, apparently I have to have a facebook to do this? Is this right?  -I'd like to constantly display a constant stock (Ultra ProShares Dow 30) on the Home screen, but I'm not seeing an option and she doesn't seem to recognize it.  -Watch Plex / Hulu / Netflix on it.  Any help, buddos? Thanks much."
"I say Alexa play ""x by x"" and she says ""sorry I don't know that song"" or something along the lines I can't find that song. So I tested out a theory, played the song manually on the Alexa and asked her what song is playing, and she says the song and artist. How is it Alexa can know what song its playing but has no clue how to bring that song up and play it when I ask?   I'm assuming the Alexa AI has a threshold and if a song on spotify has less than a certain amount of streams Alexa can't scan for it on the platform, is there a way around it other than manually playing everytime."
"Okay, I'm getting super tired of Alexa playing a different song than what I asked for, even if I explicitly described the title, album, artist, year, etc. I can't even ban her from playing certain songs and narrowing it down. The closest I've gotten is to just put those songs on a playlist, but that's ridiculous. This piece of technology should be smart enough to save preferences, or note that we like to listen to one song in particular and prioritize that song when we ask for it. Like, if we like a certain cover of the song Alexa should prioritize that cover without us including the name of the artist, album. etc. It's frustrating how unintuitive Alexa can be."
"I like keep my groups in order and it seems I can't move my groups around e.g. (Top to bottom) Master BR, Guest BR1, Guest BR2, kitchen, etc. Its sorted like how you created them on the app and that annoys me. Also, is there a way to get you devices categorized or at least moved around as well so all the echos will be together, thermostat and its sensors, rooms, etc? I seems like I have to delete my groups and start from scratch on how I add them...smh"
"So i installed the roku skill for Alexa, and then linked my roku 4 with the Alexa app, but everytime I give it a command, for example, Alexa put Netflix, alexa says it's doing it, but my roku says that I have to do it with the controller, so they are clearly connect, is my roku just stubborn?"
"...please visit the Alexa app.”  ...but the latest iOS app has no way to sign “terms of use”  No hardware or account info has changed.  New error today, have toggled accounts for years and years... :/"
"I have an Amazon echo and an Amazon smart plug connected to my lamp in my living room. Every time I ask Alexa to turn the lamp on/off she say ""Okay!""  How do I ask it to stop doing this?  The first week we had the smart plug set up, Alex said something like: Do you want me to say OK when I turn off the lamp? And being unsure, we didn't say yes in time. She has never asked again and that was a few months ago.  Not a big thing, but I would just rather she not say anything!   Thoughts or know of the correct verbiage to cut this out?"
"Any time I decline an invitation, it is hidden from my Google calendar, but Alexa still tells me about it. They can not be deleted, only declined.   Thank you."
I disabled a specific skill that was in my flash briefing and it no longer shows up in the app. HOWEVER it still keeps playing in my flash briefing. Any suggestions for how to fix? Anyone else experienced this?
"My wife and I have different logins for alexa, but I suppose the accounts are linked. In her alexa app she doesn’t see all the devices I see in mine. However if we edit a list on either of our apps, the changes are visible to both.   How can we get the device list to sync across both our apps?"
"So, watching TV and she piped up when she thought I said ""I want to say"", which lead her to say  "" I pronounce that 'to', but I'm always working on how I say things and I might not have it right""  Wat? 🤣"
"It's been over a year now and no sign of Alexa guard in the UK!  Is this feature working well state side or is it a buggy mess.  It seems that new Alexa features are slowing for UK owners of Alexa products, Alexa guard was one function I was really looking forward to but it seems we have been forgotten."
One of the new added responses!! What do you think?
"Hi all. For ages now I've been trying to get Alex's to play Eleni Foureira - Fuego but each time she just says ""I can't find fly girl by Eleni Foureira"". It's so frustrating! I'm making sure to speak very clearly but it's always the same; some times she will pick it up and other times not. Can anyone help? I'm sure it's not the way I'm speaking!"
"Is there any way for me to check the status of devices connected to Alexa and use them as triggers for a routine(even if its not through an Alexa app)  What I essentially want to do is. If (BedroomTV == on) then:     turn on bedroomLights   I've been searching all over and I can't figure out a way to do it. I feel like since Alexa app can be used to control devices, why couldn't it be possible to use these statuses as triggers to routines. I don't mind having to develop some sort of skill or have to program something to check the status and trigger something else. Anyone have any solutions?  Thanks"
"I have my Alexa connected to my Spotify account. I just said ""Alexa, play Jack and Diane"" and instead of John Mellencamp, I got the Taylor Scott version. I said ""Alexa play In Da Club"" and instead of 50 Cent, I get ""98 BPM In Da Club workout remix."" Is anyone else having issues like this? Is there a way I can default it to play the original version of a song?"
"So I want to be able to ask Alexa to turn off the Bluetooth radio on my phone via a routine.  I'd like to be able to say something along the lines of ""Alexa, switch headphones to PC"" which would disable the bluetooth on my phone, activate it on my PC (I already have this worked out via TriggerCMD), and then my headphones will connect to my PC (also already have that worked out as they are the only paired BT devices with my PC).  Then when I'm done using my headphones with the PC I want to reverse the process.  The only piece I'm missing is being able to send the command from my Echo to my phone to turn off/on the BT radio.  I got IFTTT to work turning the Bluetooth Radio on however the command to turn it off either doesn't work (75% of the time) or takes over a minute before it finally disables the BT Radio (25% of the time).  Anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks!"
"Yesterday, I was distracted and missed an announcement or message from Alexa and wonder if there is a way to find and read it.       After a number of unsuccessful attempts to get Alexa to recognize a new device, I moved my wifi extender to a new location. While I engaging in a conversation, I suddenly realized that she had found the device, and was giving me instructions, I think as to how to phrase my voice commands, but I missed more than half of what she said, and I am really curious as to the details of the announcement.      I made some educated guesses and got the device responding to my voice commands, but I am really curious to hear or read exactly what she said. Obviously, asking Alexa to repeat what she said didn't work, so I turned to Activities in the Alexa app and could find nothing relevant there.   Does anyone know if verbal announcements and instructions like these are recorded and retrievable somewhere? And if so, where can I find them?"
We have 1 Hue bulb that came with our echo. We changed WiFi SSID name and since then the damned thing doesn’t work. It won’t reset so now it’s just a fancy LED bulb
"So I have a Logitech Harmony hub, Alex, and Roku.  I've added the 2 Harmony skills and it can start the tv, switch inputs to the Roku, and open CNN but it opens to the featured clips instead of the live feed.  I have it set in the app to open to the live feed which works great if I use the remote and manually launch the CNN channel.  Any ideas?"
"Is there any way to get a device on alexa to be controlled by a calendar entry?.  For example, if I have an entry in my calendar between 09:00 and 10:00 then it turns on a light between those times?     Thanks"
"Alexa consistently gets this wrong, it tells me the distance is 1623.4 miles by car.  Also peculiarly when I open the Alexa page it has no history of this question being asked.   Can anyone else confirm this bug ?"
"Like starting or ending every response with the account name. I figure this probably isn't a setting, but maybe if there is a unique customization I can make."
We just got the dots a week ago and they have been working fine for me and my wife. Alexa knows me. I ah e had my wife setup a voice profile but Alexa can’t seem to figure out it her talking at all. If she asks an echo who is talking it has no idea. If she asks it to learn her voice it will start the process like she hasn’t already set it up on her phone. If I ask the echo it knows me and won’t start.   I tried to get the voice matching program on both my phone and hers to start but the phone just sits there doing nothing. It’s like it stalls out and fails to launch.   Any help would be appreciated.
"I have a garage door open/closed sensor and I was hoping to create a routine that if the garage stays open for over 20 minutes it would alert me that it’s been open for 20 minutes.  I created a routine and tested a 2 minute version of it, but even if I closed it right away. 2 minutes later it still says that it’s been opened for 2 minutes. Is there a way to only continue with the routine if it actually stays open for the duration of the desired time?"
"I got my mom, who lives across the country, an Alexa for Christmas and she loves it, and plays question of the day everyday.  Months after, i got mine, and they’re both on my amazon account (because my mom doesn’t have one)  The problem is, I want to play as well but if I play, then my mom isn’t able to play because it says that the question has already been answered. (By me) Is there a way of changing this so she can play her own game and keep her streaks, and I can play mine as well?   Thank you!"
Anyone know how to fix this bullshit I have Apple Music already And I used to be perfectly fine playing any song I like but today it just stopped letting me.
"I don't want Alexa talking all the time. She's already set to Brief Mode, but still talks too much. How do I get the clock, t timer, etc on the screen without her interrupting my music with a silent pause or verbally telling me the time?   I've already tried ""SHOW me"" but she still feels compelled to TELL me."
"I bought my grandmother an echo show so she can video call me and other family members, she doesn't own a phone, how important is the phone to be able to video call? I have an old iPhone I can leave in her house and download the app through there, the only problem is my grandma doesn't know how to use technology, so she is mainly just going to be using the echo show with voice command. After the initial setup, how often does the app need to be used to do a basic video call? Because I'm hoping its just a setup so I can put in all the contacts then she can just use voice command to call people."
It's been like this on and off ever since Echo Auto came out.  This is so annoying!    I'll bury my phone hoping that it won't hear the command and it still happens.  Please tell me there is something that can be done!
"Hello, my borther bought for my mother Amazon Echo Show. I'm trying to set it up so she can make calls and use her agenda on the device,  she doesn't own Amazon Prime or any Amazon account.   I made one for her but seems like it doesn't work, can't log in on the device or register Echo show on her ""device list"" on amazon App, because Echo Show is not even an option.   Is there any way to add more than one account to the same Echo Show device?"
"At night time, I find 1 inaudible, and 2 too loud.   Is there anyway to get somewhere in-between, other than using the app?  :)"
"Just Watch - Voice App (International Edition)  A couple days ago, i [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/giyc1s/i_made_this_alexa_and_googlehome_voice_app_to/) about a voice app i created for Google Home and Alexa. The response was overwhelming and i received a ton of great suggestions, feature requests &amp; around \~2k users. Hell, the post got so popular that [Android Police wrote an article about it](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/14/you-can-now-talk-to-justwatch-on-google-assistant/)!  So i got serious and **gave the voice app some superpowers** and i'm back with a shiny new version. Here's the complete description of what this voice app can do now.  *(if you want to read this post on a webpage/browser - you can do that* [here](https://vinaywadhwa.github.io/just-watch-voice/)*)*  # ⬇️ Install  If you have it already installed, you're good. Don't need to do anything. You'll automatically get these new features when you invoke it again. Otherwise,  * Amazon Alexa/Echo devices - [Download/Enable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088FJ7W1M) * Google Assistant on your Phone/Google Home devices - [Download/Enable](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/0000006c8cbb036a)  (not really needed, it just works.. read below)  P.S : You can fire up Google Assistant app on your phone and say ""Talk to Just Watch"" to start using this without installing anything. Seriously. Try it NOW!  &amp;#x200B;  ## ⚛ Features  * Find where to stream your favourite movies and tv shows in an instant. No more logging into each of Netflix, Prime Video et al to check where a movie or tv-show is available. * Direct, one-shot Invocation for Alexa (Google Home soon, hopefully) - Eg: ""Alexa, ask Just Watch to search for The Matrix"" * Ability to specify your preferred country, regardless of your device language or location. * Ability to Limit search results to your preferred offer types (subscription/rent/purchase). * Ability to announce prices with offers.  &amp;#x200B;  ## 🛠 Setup your location:  * This Action speaks out the results (streaming providers) for a given country at a time. * You can also explicitly specify your preferred country for your searches by saying ""Set Country"" at any time. * By default, it auto-detects your country based on your device language (en-US for United States, en-GB for United Kingdom and so on) * For Eg: It can only tell you which streaming providers are offering ""The Matrix"" in United States at a given time. * BUT, don't worry! if your device language is en-US and If you want to know the streaming offers in United Kingdom or Australia (for example), you can teach the Action your preferred country for searching. Just say ""Set Country"".  ##   ## 🤓 Personalisation Options  * Say ""Set Country"" to search in a country of your choice. By default, the country is auto detected based on your device language. * Say ""Set Offer Types"" to limit search results to one or all of subscription, rental or purchase offers. * Say ""Set Price Announcement"" to teach me if i should announce the actual prices of rental or purchase offers when you search for something. * Say ""Settings"" to hear about all of the available personalisation options.  &amp;#x200B;  ## ✅ Supported Devices  &amp;#x200B;  [doesn't work with a piece of rock, YET .. but practically everywhere else](https://preview.redd.it/4gbyj42vljz41.png?width=411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46646cf0b08c4cd3e28b02c8912259166fb56905)  ## 👬 Want to contribute?  * This skill is powered by (unofficial) JustWatch APIs.

"This week Amazon brings 22 new–or newly promoted–Alexa commands. So if you’re having trouble thinking of new things to say or ask Alexa, this will help.   I’ve tried out and weigh each command’s usefulness here:   [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-may-18th/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-may-18th/)  By far my favorite is hearing Rudyard Kipling poems. Have you tried asking Alexa to read poetry to you yet?"
It just opens ambient sounds no matter how hard I try or any other methods.   I’ve had my device for a week and the first week I could say ‘Alexa open ambient visuals’ and she would.
"Before I get into things I wanted to briefly explain my setup. My PC is connected to two audio interfaces. A Native Instruments Komplete Audio 2 (to output sound to my headphones) and a Focusrite Scarlett-6i6 (to output sound to my two JBL 305P MkII 5"" 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors). I like being able to have music play through my Studio Monitors while I listen to something else through my headphones. The Studio Monitors are connected to the Focusrite with a XLR to TRS (1/4 Inch) TRS Male to 3 PIN XLR Male cable each.   So with the above knowledge of my setup, does anyone know of anyway to have Alexa (Amazon Echo Dot) connect to my PC and use the studio monitors? In other words, I want to be able to tell Alexa to play music and then I want it to play through my Studio Monitors and not the Echo Dot speaker. I have Alexa both connected to my phone and PC but I'm just not finding any way to make this work. Any ideas?"
"It's still plugged in with the original power cord. I've tried unplugging it, resetting it, and I've had no luck at all. This just started out of nowhere."
"I have a few routines which use Alexa Says and I had added speech pauses by entering peroids. Up until a few days ago they worked fine, now Alexa Varela through the sentences without stopping for periods or commas. Anyone else experience this?"
"Three Echos, kitchen , living room, bedroom.  Can be playing music in one room, but if the one in the bedroom is prompted in the bedroom, the music in the living room pauses while the bedroom one listens/answers the prompt.   Living Room Echo is not within earshot of the bedroom, just seems like the connected system is pausing to process the request.  Any way around this?"
I wanna wake up with some motivational video!
Does anyone elses Alexa answer questions in the middle of the night when you are sound asleep?     It happens often ..kind of used to it.. but a few minutes ago it answered the murder rate in the US.      I am a little sketched out 😊
"1. Open Alexa app, 2. swipe sidebar, 3. touch „Lists“, and then 4. open To Do or Shoping list = takes way too much time.  Furthermore, syncing with Todoist, Any.do or  other Services via IFTTT ist not reliable enough IMO."
I'm trying to create a night routine and I can't add ring to routine in the home mode. Alexa adds it as away.
"... And get the information on the Northern Pike. Happening on echo And fire TV. Asked what Alexa heard, and it replies ""I heard what did Jack Do"". What's going on and why am I getting info on a fish?"
"She just blows through the custom text. There are commas, periods as they were previously when she read all of it in a timely manner. Also abbreviation ""HQ"" which was just read ""HQ"" now has awkward giant pauses between the letters - H.......... Q......... - was it an update or a setting I changed by accident? I don't recall changing anything - it just happened one morning and persists. I tried ""Alexa, slow down"" to make it slower but it doesn't change a thing. I reckon I should try to restart and see if that helps."
"11 PM.    Me: Alexa play sleep sounds window meadow Alexa: (Loud as Fuck Level 1 Volume) Would you like me to open Sounds? Me: No Alexa, Open Sleep Sounds Window Meadows Alexa: Opening Sounds would you Like me to Play a list of what Sounds I can Play?  BLAH BLAH BLAH I can do this I can do that. Me: No, Alexa Play Sleep Sounds Alexa: I am unable to Play blah blah fuck you I do not know shit Me: Alexa open Sleep Sounds Alexa: Opening sleep sounds.   Did you know that your eligible to be a Pro member?  With anoro member you have access to bsbsbsbsbs blah blah blah blah blah  Me: Alexa shut up Alexa: Me: Alexa play Windy Meadow Alexa: I do not know what that meabs Me: Open sleep sounds Windy Meadow Alexa: Opening Sleep Sounds Windy Meadows.  I mean what da hell?  Anyway I can get Alexa to wrap it the fuck up.  Cant even go sleep."
I have a smartthings hub with smart lights/ door locks and WiFi outlets around the house. My son got an Alexa dot. I thought I did the right thing and created family access so he will have a child account. My wife has her own Alexa and shares it as an adult account. She has access to all of the smart devices and routines. My son doesn’t have the devices listed. Is there a way to share the smart devices to his echo dot?
"So my internet went out last night when I discovered there's a new error response that includes ""Please check your **Alexa** app.""  Once one Alexa device hears its name it started a chain reaction like something out of a horror movie, as all Alexas in the house start talking to each other about checking the Alexa app (2 studios, 1 echo, and 7 echo dots cover every room of my house). Without a network there's no smart listening feature so they were all in an infinite error loop talking over each other. It used to say ""**sorry the device is not responding please check its network connection and power supply""** but now it says its own wake word ALEXA, causing complete insanity. It was funny for the first 3 minutes maybe before having to hunt down and unplug all 10 devices. Why does the new network error include its own WAKE WORD?"
"I have an echo dot 2nd gen.  I'm thinking the mic isn't very good.  Whenever I'm playing nature sounds, I'm saying Alexa very loud until I see a response.  Not sure if it's the dot its self or something else.  Do other models have a more receptive mic?    Thanks"
"Sometime last week I noticed I couldn’t see my Alexa devices in my Spotify app to cast to. It’s happened before so I didn’t think much of it but it’s been a week and I still can’t cast to them.   I tried disabling/enabling skill, deleting and re-downloading Spotify, Reset wireless network (they are all connected), reset my phone, reset the Alexa devices (show, echo, 3x dot)   Any ideas?"
"I'm a high school student who has a lot of free time due to quarantine. I have an Alexa but don't really use it that often (besides basic requests for time, weather, lights etc.). I wanted to see what skills the community wishes were there."
"I've set up the Hue lights to be turned off/on by Alexa, but part of the cool factor was having the Hue lights match and/or interact with the content playing on the TV.  Do I need a Philips Smart Bridge to achieve that?  Thanks!"
"Anybody know if it's possible to pair an Amazon Echo with Sonos (Beam &amp; Sonos One (x2) ), but while also having Alexa enabled. Trying to find out a use case for the Echo, since I don't use Alexa / Siri for anything."
"I’m thinking about getting the Amazon Echo Dot with Clock and wondered if I could wake up to a specific playlist from my Spotify each morning?  Also, if so each morning will the playlist shuffle so that I don’t wake up to the same song each morning?  Thanks a lot"
"OK, so I've had the Amazon Echo Dot for a while now and I absolutely love it. However, there are some aspects of the Amazon Alexa IOS/Android app that I feel could use some reorganization in terms of the UX, especially as I grow my echo ecosystem with multiple echo/smart devices in multiple rooms of my house.  So here are some things that I would like to see implemented in the Alexa app that I feel would greatly enhance the user experience:  * Routine widgets    * Routines should be added as widgets in the Alexa app home screen    * Routines should be added as widgets in the Today View of IOS devices    * Alexa should be able to play a routine when triggered by the button widget from IFTTT  &amp;#x200B;  * Device subgroups    * Within groups such as ""Bedroom"" or ""Living Room"" I should be able to create subgroups.       * For example, within the device group ""Bedroom"", I should be able to create a subgroup called ""bedside lamps"". That way, I can say ""Alexa, turn off bedside lamps"" and have both the smart bulbs in my lamps turn off simultaneously instead of ""Alexa, turn off bedside lamp 1"" and then ""Alexa, turn off bedside lamp 2""  &amp;#x200B;  * Desktop support    * I realize that Alexa is already available on select PCs, but would it be too much to ask if there was a decent, reliable, non-sketchy Alexa app available in the macOS app store where I can control all my devices/routines?    * If it *is* too much to ask for a decent, reliable, non-sketchy Alexa macOS app, can I at least get an online desktop site that allows me to control all my devices/routines (unlike the current [alexa.amazon.com](https://alexa.amazon.com) website that is just outdated and barely does anything)?  &amp;#x200B;  I realize these complaints seem minor/trivial, but they really just get on my nerves and I have a hunch that I'm not the only one who gets annoyed by these things."
"Having all kinds of problems with the skill. Just about every single time no matter what device I try to turn it on it says I have to link my account even though it says on the Alexa app even though it is already linked. Sometimes I just open the link settings and close it and then it starts to play. Sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes I do it again and I have different results. Sometimes I don’t. Lol. When Sirius Xm plays, sometimes it goes for a few songs and stops. Sometimes it starts up again after a long pause, and sometimes it doesn’t. I’ve tried uninstalling the skill, reinstalling the skill… It hasn’t helped. Anyone have any suggestions? Thanks!"
"I think she's messing with me. I say "" Lianne La Havas "" and I get, "" Lianne La Havas , from Spotify"" , and it resumes whatever the last thing that was playing. It does this \*only\* for her. I'm in North America"
"My 97 year old mom is in a nursing home. Got her an Alexa Show to make it easier to stay connected during the corona pandemic when nursing homes are in total lockdown. It generally works fine as a phone and is simple enough for her to use, but she is hard of hearing and misses every call (especially because she blasts her TV). I tried Drop-In, but she doesn’t hear us unless she shuts off her TV first.   Was thinking to connect a smart-plug to Alexa so a table lamp would flash when there is an incoming call. She would then know there’s a call and shut off the TV. Anyone know if that is possible (and how)?   Or is there a better way to make Alexa more visually prominent when there is an incoming call?  Or can I directly connect Alexa to the TV and MUTE it when there is a call?"
" Experiment time! What do think of this idea for a series?  [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/alexa-skill-spotlight-metronome/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/alexa-skill-spotlight-metronome/)  We can use it to highlight awesome and unusual skills and features for Alexa. Alexa users benefit by discovering new features. Developers benefit by getting their skill some visibility.  To start out, I went with skills that turn Alexa into a Metronome, which I discovered myself the other week.  Let me know what you think. Also, REALLY let me know if you have a skill or feature that deserves a highlight."
"Today I finally committed to making my kitchen look smart and bought a 5m light strip for under the cupboards, however there's a short gap where my cookers extraction unit is that I want to skip. The kit came with some 5 inch long bridges, but these won't do for what I require, so I'm curious if anyone has made their own extensions by soldering a longer cable onto each wire for these extenders, and if so is there any special requirements for the type of wire used?"

So I've got my spotify linked up to my Alexa echo dot  And say for example I have a song paused on spotify  I then request a new song the old song continues where it left off even though my alexa has confirmed the knew song starting  Example   Green day basketcase on pause on spotify   Me :alexa play rise against  help is on the way   Alexa: ok playing help is on the way by rise against   Green Days baskcase carrys on from where it was paised
"I use Alexa with home automation. I would tell it to ""turn on the TV"" and it would turn on my TV, receiver and XBox like it is supposed to. Lately when I tell it to ""turn on the TV"", it tells me several things ""a few things share the name V, which one do you want?"". I have to tell it T  V with an obvious pause between the letters. Why is this happening now?"
"So I have an Echo Show in my main room and an original Echo Dot in the bathroom.  This worked great for many months, and it always picked up the one I wanted when I was closer to it.  For the last month, however, I've had a serious problem.  I can talk very quietly to my Echo Show and somehow it keeps picking up on the Echo Dot unless I close the room down.  It always thinks the Dot is the device if I talk loud, too, instead of the show that is literally about 10 inches from my head.  Is there any way to re-calibrate this?  Did they recently vastly improve the ability of a Dot to understand people?  Before I got the show the Dot couldn't understand me unless it was in the same room."
"I control my premium Spotify via Alexa.  I simply defaulted my Alexa to Spotify and have never had an issue.  Today, ""Spotify skill is not enabled"" I went to the app and enabled the skill and the new skill is shit (e- bit harsh, let's say ""more involved""). I tried to get music to play but it seemed weird. (E- got music to finally play but it's a new skill, and it requires another set up)  Did not change or do anything prior to the first issue.  Any advice?  Edit: so apparently the skill is now geo graphically locked? I'm in Ireland what the actual fuck. This is literally the only thing I use my echo for."
"So I need to connect my echo dot to Xfinitywifi but that's obviously not possible because there's no way for it to authenticate the sign in page of xfinity. I tried changing my PCs Mac address to sign in with that of the dot, but had no success. If anyone had any advice or workaround please let me know! -Just moved, no wifi in home. Using buildings Hotspot."
"Hi! First time I linked Alexa to an older account I had, Alexa wouldn't play the song I requested (let's say ""rosenrot by rammstein"") to save its life, only radio (the ""rosenrot radio""). I created a new account and linked it and it worked fine for about one week, playing the song/artist as requested without any kind of problem.   Today, out of nowhere starting playing radio instead of the requested music again. I've tried doing that again but with no success. All accounts are on free membership. I don't know if it's because of Spotify or my Alexa Dot. Anyone had this problem and found any solution?"
"With Wink now charging a monthly fee I as hoping to connect my light bulbs directly to Alexa if possible.  I'm willing to get a new hub if needed but was hoping with my handful of Dots, and one Show I wouldnt need one.  Does anyone have any experience with this?"
I use Amazon Music Unlimited in my phone and I want it to stop playing on my Alexa. How do I disconnect my account from the Alexa?
"Please help!! I have the newer amazon echo with the clock display on the speaker. Every single time my power goes out and my generator kicks on, my Alexa and all my smart bulbs forget everything. I have to completely reconnect and synchronize every smart bulb and plug in my house. Now, my dad has an older echo with no clock display. He does not have this problem. His lights come on when the power goes out, but his echo remembers the groups and bulbs. I’m at my wits end with this and I’m ready to toss it in the garbage. A huge inconvenience."

Hello! I have an Echo Show 5 and I wanted to know if I can block the touch screen since I have a baby who loves Alexa and she’s always touching it and activating it.  Thank you!
Alexa won’t let me play explicit songs. I have gone into the app and disabled it and I’ve asked Alexa to disable it and she says it’s already off. So I ask for it to play some music and it says the name of the song and who made it like it does normally but then it never plays and it only does this for explicit songs. I can play other songs just fine.  Can anyone help me out?
I can’t issue commands to Alexa when not on WiFi. The rest of the app works just fine. I can use all the toggles and everything. Just can’t tell her what to do. Any help would be appreciated.   Thanks!
So I have the Alexa app downloaded and the setting for cellular data is turned on in the iPhone settings. Is there something in the app I need to tell to use cellular when I am out of the house?  Thanks!
"I'm using a Vizio D43n-E1 with a 3rd gen Echo Dot and a current gen non 4k fire stick  It can do power and volume commands just fine, and could even switch the inputs on an older vizio tv in the same room, but it can't seem to get input switching figured out on my main TV.    Any suggestions?"
"This is getting frustrating.   I have a FireTV Cube in the living room and a Dot in the kitchen.  I've renamed the dot to AMAZON because it would often try to respond to requests for the TV and mess things up.   This has worked well for almost a year.  Now all of a sudden things have changed and the DOT is responding when the FireTV talks.  For example...    ME:  Alexa - Play some Classic Rock. FireTV:  Ok Playing Classic Rock from Amazon Music. DOT: (Hearing the word Amazon from the FireTV) Playing Classic Rock from Amazon Music.  For some reason the DOT is faster and starts playing, leaving the firetv to tell me that music is streaming from somewhere else.  I'm thinking I'll need to rename the DOT to something else... perhaps echo... but I finally got my wife trained to call it Amazon, and she's harder to train than the DOT is!"
"Alexa (on a Sonos One) has suddenly started saying this whenever I want to play something via Apple Music. I'm based in the UK and has been working fine for the past six months since I bought it. Playing music via Apple Music works fine when I use the Sonos app.  I've tried turning it off and on again at the mains, removing and relinking Apple Music, and removing and relinking Alexa on the Sonos. Any other suggestions much appreciated!"
"Long story short, my wife and I usually have Alexa play a song to sing my daughter to sleep. She's usually knocked out by the end. But sometimes (like 5% of the time), Alexa will say ""TO KEEP THE MUSIC PLAYING, JUST SAY 'PLAY MORE MUSIC LIKE THIS'"" and that wakes her right back up. Is there a way to disable follow-ups like that? I just want the song to end in silence.  &amp;#x200B;  Note: Just found out about Brief Mode, but I couldn't find it in my app."
"I am attempting to link my Amazon music account to my brother's echo dot (we live together, no quarantine break), but I'm running into some issues. It seems that his app wants to connect to his Amazon music on the same account, but he has no premium, nor does he have any interest in getting it. Is there a way to link my Amazon music to his dot on different accounts?"
"Hello,  My dot 3 lost the wifi connection somehow, and wouldn't reconnect.  So I reseted it and now, when I enter the wifi password the Alexa app tell me the password is incorrect.  I have others devices and alexa devices connected to the wifi with no problems, and of course I am 100% sure of my wifi password.  Thanks for your help !"
"As of this morning, my echo has been reminding me to take occasional breaks and has also reminded me when it’s lunch time. I sleep late so there may have been more reminders that I missed. Anyone know what this is? I don’t remember enabling any setting to do this. More importantly, how do I turn this off?"
"Hi,  I have a 94 year old grandmother, who's hard to hearing, that  I'm trying to teach how to use Netflix. I thought the best way to do this was to get her a Amazon Fire TV cube but the process of trying to explain to her how to navigate AV channels / HDMI inputs, and how to use the UI is extremely painful. I love her dearly but she can barely use any piece of technology and this whole process has required Buddha levels of time and patience. She couldn't figure out how to change the channel for the entirety of yesterday and didn't tell me until I phoned to check in.  We're using an old Sony Bravia tv which is complicating the process. If getting rid of the cube and using an Alexa TV is simpler for her I'd prefer to do that. Please could I get some advice on choosing a setup (i.e a TV and / or an Alexa (or google!) device) that tries to achieve the following:  \- Interact with a visual UI / remotes as little as possible. Turning the TV on, navigating to any channel and through Netflix with just voice would be ideal.  \- Is configurable for simplicity (e.g. disabling all but the necessary input channels, and automatically loads into the Alexa input, or doesn't even require switching to an input).  \- Not interested in 4k unless it's impossible to choose a setup without getting a TV that has 4k. Definitely not interested in forking out for OLED or QLED unnecessarily.   Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
"I know I can get surround music from it, but can I get surround TV (like dolby atmos) without using a fire tv cube or stick. I don't mind how I do it with bluetooth or 3.5mm, and if I can't do this, how does it come out, is it 2.1 or is it just 1"
"My kids listen to Amazon Storytime FAR too much.  I only catch the stories a little bit when they listen, and have already nearly memorized the available stories.  &amp;#x200B;  We have asked them to listen to other things. We have provided them many options to do so. They continue to open Storytime.  We finally built a custom command which triggers with ""open Amazon Storytime"" to block it, but they have found other ways of asking which get them in to the StoryTime.  &amp;#x200B;  We have disabled the skill.  It still shows as disabled.  It is playing right now.     Please... for the sanity of myself and my wife... is there any way to get this feature GONE for good?"

"I rather get the feeling that Alexa's developers don't read this subreddit, but, by the way, if I ask Alexa for something simple such as to tell me the time or to tell me the temperature or to set a timer, I do not want Alexa to say, ""By the way,"" and then offer to tell me the news or to tell me the pollen count or to entertain me while ""we"" wait for the timer with a story.  This is just useless venting, I know.  I have already set Alexa to brief mode.  I have already submitted feedback, multiple times, with the Alexa app.  I have already posted on Amazon's Alexa forum.  I have already tweeted to the stupid Alexa marketing Twitter that only posts pre-scheduled Alexa marketing drivel.  And I have also ordered a cheap Google Home device to see if it's as annoying as Alexa.  If it's not, I might throw every Echo I have out and start over with Google.  Though that's probably not going to happen because I'm sure Google Home can be annoying too."
"I have a song that we try to play on repeat all night. We have it in a playlist, but we notice that the song gets cut off intermittently, and therefor the playlist does not get through the night. I have added just the song to the routine, but cannot get it to turn on Loop mode automatically. I have tried adding ""On Loop"" to the song title, but this does not work. Are there any other suggestions to fix this?"
"I own a 3rd generation Amazon Echo Dot and it has been great to have.  The sound on it is pretty good but I guess it would be a better to have it go through my living room speakers.  I'm using a Yamaha rx-v679bl receiver with a few Polk speakers connected to them.  I was able to get the Echo to use the Bluetooth sound in the receiver but the only way to hear that is to switch to that input.  I guess I could use the 3.5mm jack on the Echo Dot but I'll probably just have the same issue.  I would love it if the Echo Dot would use the active input.  My setup in the receiver is pretty simple as I'm using a Fire Stick in HDMI 1, Nintendo Switch in HDMI 2 and a PS3 in HDMI 3.  Anyone have an idea on how to get around this?  Perhaps this is a question better suited for a subreddit on my receiver but I figured I would start here."
just received a new echo dot and set it up. Alexa told me about my package that was delivered today. Afterwords I noticed it kept flashing so I asked about messages and then about notifications. There werent any but I asked her to clear them anyway. I even turned off all push notifications through the app but it still continues to flash. It’s very annoying and not sure what else to try.
"...and until today, it would have been me.  I’ve been telling it to pause but needing to manually play because ‘Alexa play’ would start up music.  Maybe everyone’s figured this out but I’ve been an Alexa user for years and somehow I managed to miss it so maybe there’s one or two others who will learn from my eventual discovery.  I was stuck in the Play/Pause physical button mind trap.  Whoops!"
"Is there some way to have alexa take multiple actions when a timer goes off after ""Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes""?  I want to be able to set a timer easily like I always do but when the timer goes off have her flash a light or something"
"Today, after asking Alexa to set a timer, it said something along the lines of, ""While you wait, try listening to a podcast. Say ""Podcast"" to get started.""  I don't want this to happen. I want it to do what I ask and nothing more. How can I disable this feature?"
"I’ve been using the “name your timer” function for a while, especially when I cook. Alexa used to say “your chicken timer is going off”, but as of a few days ago it just says “your timer is done”. This is when I’ll have 3 or 4 named timers going at once. I have to specifically ask Alexa which timer has finished for it to tell me which one.   Anyone else have this issue? I didn’t change any settings at all so I’m wondering if there was an update and this is an unfortunate change because of it?"
"A few weeks ago she stopped being able to turn off my lights connect with Philips Hue. She kept telling me to go into the Alexa app and disconnect and reconnect it. So I did that and it still didn't work. I finally just decided to delete all the lights and readd them, and it ""worked"" for about a day or two. She couldn't use scenes but could turn the lights on and off. Now she can only control half the lights, and the ones she can control she says she can't despite them going on and off. But now even the fire stick remotes aren't working. My one tv doesn't support auto HDMI changing. So I set up Alexa to change to game console when I say ""switch to game console"" except she can't do that anymore. Even after going into the settings and setting it up again. The fire stick switches back and forth during the set up, but it doesn't work afterwards. She just keeps saying ""hmm I can't switch to that input"" and tells me to go to the into the settings menu. Does anyone else have these problems or a solution?"
"My kids are schooling from home, and Alexa reminders has been very useful in keeping them on a regular routine.  I'm just wondering if there's a way to get her to stop saying ""this is your reminder...""  Not the reminder that follows, just that specific preamble before the reminder.  I know by the chime that it's a reminder.  Is this doable?"
"So basically I have a routine set up that turns on my Xbox, roku tv, and rgb backlight. But I can’t seem to find a way to change the input automatically. I can tell Alexa to change it by saying, “Alexa, change tv to hdmi1.” And that works fine but if there’s a way to automate it I. The routine that would be much better. I’d like to avoid getting an ir blaster and using ifttt as well."
"I have one light. ONE. And Alexa never can turn this on by saying turn on the lights. I’ve NEVER BEEN ABLE to tell Alexa turn on the lights and have it work. Wtf. I have to give my light the name “torch” in order for it to work.   Is Alexa this stupid, or am I?"
"Everything my Alexa auto says or plays has about the last second cut off.  It doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is starting to annoy me.  Is there something I can do to correct this?"
"I have a first gen echo show that has been a real workhorse in my kitchen. Recently, less than a month ago I started getting the response, I couldn't  find that"" when I select some videos on prime. It's mostly around prime originals, but I can watch Jack Ryan. I thought it may be newer content (rendering) but I cant play the Sopranos either. My purchased content plays, but that's a couple of older movies. Other streaming content plays, like hulu, and videos.   I've performed a factory reset but still get the same results. Does anyone have any ideas on what to try next? Amazon has not responded and I haven't seen any similar issues."
"Hello, i am planning to buy alexa echo dot 3rd gen directly from the Amazon store, since it is way too expensive to buy in the stores here, but as far as i can see the power conector is not the same we use here,  our wall conections are round and the one that comes with it is differently shaped .  Is there another version of it ? How can i find it ?  I am from Portugal by the way."
I have an Echo Dot. When I tell her to do something I have to scream the command really loud to get her to activate. I fear dust has gotten into her 4 holes on top of her. Whats the best approach to clean those holes out without damaging Alexa?
"I have 2 echo dots, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. One pair of hue bulbs in the living room, a pair in the bedroom, plus a lamp with a zigbee bulb connected to hue and a zigbee outlet also with hue. When I say ""Alexa, turn on the light"" in the bedroom, the overhead light and the lamp turn on. How can I make it so that command only turns on the overhead light without affecting any other fixtures/groups/rooms?  Basically when I say ""Alexa turn on the light"" I want only the overhead light to turn on, and when I say ""Alexa turn on the lamp"" I want only the lamp to turn on. I want them to be in the same ""group"" if that is possible to show that they are in the same room. Thanks in advance."
The title says it all.  I have a ton of light switches connected through ring alarm and I want to use the press of one to trigger a second light.  Is this possible?
So I have Alexa routines and a few Echos. I use IFTTT to give me an app alert when an Alexa timer finishes. But other than that I’m not using IFTTT with Alexa for anything else.   Can anyone share what they’re doing with the two platforms together please? Any guidance on how to go about it would be useful too (I’m an IFTTT noob!)  Thanks in advance 👍
"Hello all,  I’m trying to create a routine that would automatically turn on accent lighting based on the weather... on a cloudy or overcast day it makes the difference."
"So after about 18 months with Alexa my only true gripe is that I cannot add things to custom lists.  I use Things 3 as a ToDoList app so I have to jump though hoops to even add things to that with a workflow of     Alexa ++ToDoIst + Zapier + Things its limiting to only 1 list.   &amp;#x200B;  I use a similar workflow from Google Home and I can say  &amp;#x200B;  ""Google, Add $ to my Computer List""   &amp;#x200B;  and with that it can take things from the computer list, add them to the correct ToDoList list, which I can add a note into so if the note says ""Computer"" since it came from that list it gets imported into Things with ""Computer"" in the notes, which an Applescript I have sorts it to the correct ""Area"" in things.   &amp;#x200B;  While the steps to do it seem cumbersome once its set up it runs fine.   &amp;#x200B;  I prefer Alexa for all my other voice actions. But adding to lists is to me the most important of the functions.    &amp;#x200B;  Has anyone found a decent workaround for custom lists and Alexa?"
"This week Amazon releases 19 new--or newly promoted in their newsletter--Alexa commands. While that number alone may sound daunting, I've taken a stab at testing each and highlighting those that are actually useful. From celebrating mom to having your kids build their very own lemonade stand, check it out.   [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-may-11th/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-commands-may-11th/)   Would love your thoughts, especially on that predatory 'Meow' command."
"Hey Alexa gurus - I just got an Echo Show 5, and would like to use it as a fancy alarm clock.  I already have a 'goodnight' routine, which turns off all the lights; because I usually sleep with white noise, I've added the ""white noise"" skill to this routine.  So far so good - white noise launches after the lights go off.  But the white noise skill info remains on the screen.  I would prefer to start the skill, and then go back to the home (clock) screen.  I could say ""Alexa, go home"" once the white noise starts, and that would do it - but I'd prefer to bundle it into the routine.  Is this possible?     Thanks in advance!"
"My two echo shows seem to have stopped allowing me to pair with my phone. Anyone else having this issue? I've tried having the Echo Show ""forget"" my phone and re-adding it, as well as simply restarting the Show, but still nothing."
I have the routine enabled to “open tv remote” but it just asks me to enter the IP address of the tv. So I don’t think that’s the right option.  I can turn the tv on off and access any app via the Echo dot. So the two are connected. I just want my tv to turn on along with my lights when I say good morning. I really couldn’t google this problem correctly.
"I have two Alexa devices (not counting my fire stick and tablet). An echo show that lives in my living room, and an echo dot that lives in my bedroom. Lately, I can be sitting directly next to the show, and instead the dot will answer. Further, I am having a weird flash briefing issue. I will ask it to skip a specific show because I have heard it already, but instead of skipping to my next show, it starts skipping through old shows for no reason. Plus, I routinely have to unplug and replug it to get it to sync properly with spotify on my iPhone. Has anyone experienced any of these issues?"
I keep seeing posts online of how to do it but I don't have the option on my alexa smart phone app. The photo option in settings doesn't even show up.  Any help would be appreciated.
"Hi everyone, a bit of a niche question here that I haven't been able to solve with Google. I have Alexa enabled on my Sonos speaker at my desk (one of three around the flat). Since lockdown, I've been having lots of meetings at home and occasionally I meet with my colleague Alexa!  I need to disable Alexa during these meetings as it's a pain in the a** when she chimes up after I say my colleague's name, but the only way I can find to do this is by unplugging the Sonos completely, which is annoying as I have to crawl under my desk to do so.   Does anyone know how I can disable Alexa and stop her responding completely through the app during these meetings?  Thank you in advance!  tldr: How can I stop Alexa responding for about one hour a week?"
"I have several Echo devices in my home, but only one of them refuses to play my Flash Briefing.   I say: “Alexa, play my flash briefing”  Alexa starts and then when it gets to the first one it just...stops. No error, no lights, nothing.   I’ve reconnected Wi-Fi, I’ve reset the whole device, changed all the flash briefing feeds.   Nothing seems to work to get this one device to play the flash briefing. It works everywhere else.   Any ideas?"
"I turned an old fire tablet into SHOW mode, paired to an echo dot 3 as Bluetooth speaker. I turned off the mic on the dot so only the tablet will pickup commands. But when I asked it to play one of my Apple Music mixes, it tells me that it doesn’t have that skill.   So can I only play Apple Music from the dot itself, and not the tablet?"
"I was going to post on the echo sub, but it hasn’t had a post for 3 months.  My wife loves a few of the nature screen savers on the Echo show and I was looking for a list of the photos used."
"Hello, I’ve recently bought a echo dot and I’m having issues with Alexa not responding. The light doesn’t turn on when talking to it or anything. I’ve paired it up to my phone. Dropping in, playing music ect all works. Just having issues talking to the echo dot itself. So at the moment it’s kind of acting like a speaker. This is my only Alexa product so I’m just wondering if I need the Amazon Echo in order for it to work? Apologies if this is the wrong place to be asking."
"I’ve been enjoying tinkering around with the interesting features that come with device. However, ever since last night I have been unable to use skills with my device, mostly ambient sounds. I have tried multiple skills, enabling, and disabling them but nothing seems to work. Anyone know why this happens? A similar issue happened with connecting my Spotify account through my dot where I would ask to play music but nothing would play."
"I have managed to set up my Echo Dot to control my Roku and TV.  I am able to ask Alexa to open the YouTube Channel and all works great.  It seems pretty cool to me.  Now I would like to ask Alexa to play content from a specific channel, ideally the most recent upload or, even better, the next in a play list.  In other words, I'd like to say something like ""Alexa play the latest content from Global Cycling Network on YouTube,"" after which she would launch YouTube, open the GCN channel, and play the most recent upload.  Or if I am watching in a series, I would say ""Alexa, play the next episode of Kobra Kai on YouTube"" and she would find the last one I watched, then launch the next one.  Is this possible at all?  Or is getting Roku to open YouTube as close as I can get?  Thanks!"
If I use my Alexa to call someone will I still be able to call someone else on my phone even if they’re linked.
I wanna transfer my PS3 from my Hall (which has a crappy dying TV to my room (with a 768p decent monitor and an echo Dot). Is it possible to use my Alexa as a PS3 slim audio output since my monitor doesn't really have a speaker attached to it and PS3 doesn't come with an aux port and it doesn't support USB headsets for gaming.
I want to be able to hear the door bell on throughout the multiple levels in my house. I heard that its better to use a dot for the doorbell alerts rather than the chime. should I just get a dot for each foor or use chimes. is it possible for ring to send alerts to both when the door bell is rung?
"Real simple concept: I just want my samsung TV to turn Eco Solution Power Saving Mode on every night at 11:30 pm. Reason being is that its dimmer than normal and I can sleep better.  So far, it seems routines will only let me turn the TV on or off. Any tips, guys?"

"Hey guys, I'm wondering if there's a way to make more advanced routines - or rather how to do more advanced routines. Simple scenario is a long hallway where I have a motion sensor installed at one and and another at the other end. I want the light to turn on when either sensor triggers a motion and only turn off when both sensors don't have any motion for a certain time (the sensor already only sends after 30s, that's fine).  Can i do this with the alexa app itself or do i have to copy the routine for each motion sensor? What other apps might work better for smarter routines? Thanks in advance!"

"Hey guys, just got my first Alexa device and whenever I try to link spotify via the app I get [this message](https://i.imgur.com/76tht8T.jpg) for like half a second, then it crashes back to the Alexa app. I've tried linking on desktop as well but spotify isn't even an option there.   Also tried different phones, uninstalling and re installing Alexa App, Factory reset the Echo itself, none of these have worked. Anyone experienced this before or know of a solution? I don't see why somehing so simple is turning out to be so complicated, Im beginning to think Amazon are just trying to force people to get Prime Music."
"I walked in my bedroom and said ""alexa, turn on the lights."" this always turns on both lights in the room. Today it stopped doing it and says there is no device called lights. I went into the control group and the echo is no longer on the list. When I try to set preferred speaker it dosent show it as an option and just says ""everywhere"" however she still does control things and is working just not in this particular way. Any advice?"
"Hello,  we have an Amazon Tap which is primarily used to play white noise for the baby. It was working fine until I tried to put the baby down for an afternoon nap and the 'loop white noise' command wasn't recognised and instead the Tap starting talking to me in German. My German is a bit limited so I couldn't do much with it, when I checked later on my phone I noticed German was added and selected as the main language on the device. We have several other Amazon devices and nothing has changed on them. Anyone has an idea how this could be added?   If anyone needs more info, we speak mainly English in our household and I speak Dutch to the baby (my other kids understand Dutch but don't really speak it). No one really says anything besides 'Alexa start white noise' and 'Alexa stop' to this device. It was working fine 4 hours prior when he went down for a morning nap.  Only my phone has the Alexa app on it to configure devices and it's been off for a few days since it won't charge any longer."

"If I give my Alexa a command, like I’m going to sleep, the routine says to turn on the light in a certain room to purple at 17 percent. But when I do the command, the light flashes purple and the goes back to the previous color that was on the light. Any help or how to fix this?"
"So, I'm just 1 foot away from my Echo Show and gave her a command but it's my Echo Plus that's 25 feet away that answered. I have 6 Echo devices and I have seen this behavior often lately on any of my Echo devices.   Anyone else are having that issue?"

"My Echo Dot won't play Spotify no matter what I've tried (factory reset, changing wifi, unlinking and linking spotify in Alexa settings, etc). My premium plan is Family. Anyone know what to do?

"So I'm trying to mess with my wife a little. Alexa already occasionally will answer with my name at the end when I ask her what the weather is going to be.  Sometimes she will even say something like, ""enjoy the sunshine, ROBERT"" at the end .   This makes my wife laugh because she never does it to her, and I would like to play a little joke on her.   Is there a way to make Akexa answer every question I ask with my name at the end?  Even better, if she could call me 'handsome' once in a while that would be great.   I have created a voice profile and even tried changing my name. She recognises my voice when I ask her, but she won't call me by name when I ask a question.   TIA  Handsome Robert"
"I can get alexa to play the most recent episode, but no older episodes... any ideas?"
I have several Cree bulbs that work flawlessly with Wink - and Alexa via Wink.  I'd like to move them over to my my Echo Show which claims to work with these bulbs  without any other hub.  I am having no luck with Alexa discovering them - even a brand new one never set up on Wink.     Any &amp; all suggestions are welcome.   Thanks!
"I have noticed that Alexa will randomly rediscover devices I already have connected. She will list these as ""new devices"" even though they're already connected and working fine.  She will also sometimes add them to the wrong automatic device types at the top of the devices section (listing a smart switch under the plugs category, or a smart plug under the lights category).  When doing this, she will also randomly add things to the wrong groups I have created (adding my driveway light to my upstairs group).   Any idea why this is happening or what to do to fix it?"
"This has been an issue for weeks, not just because Spotify was messed up today. For the life of me, I cannot get Multi-Room music to work with Spotify anymore.  I have a group called “Everywhere” which has 1x Echo spot , 3x 3rd generation dots, 1x echo show 5, 1x echo show 2nd generation, and 1x echo 3rd generation. The echos are on their own SSID and VLAN which has access to LAN. I can play Spotify individually on each echo, with no issue. When I do multi room music, sometimes music will play on most of the devices.   When it does play, it will typically display the wrong song. After a while, music will just stop playing. When it stops, I can never get it to start again until a decent amount of time passes.   Other info, I run a Meraki MR33 AP and a Meraki MX65 firewall at home.   Has anyone else had these issues ? Is there a fix for this ? It drives me insane. Multi-Room music is one of my favorite features, especially when I’m cleaning.   I’ve already deleted the group and remade it. Restarted all of the devices. Paired and unpaired my Spotify account. I’m going insane help."

"After experiencing some difficulty getting certain allegedly Alexa compatible devices to actually work with Alexa, I decided to get an IR blaster to go around her limitations and just make her work all the remotes in the house. The IR blaster works great for the most part, but I can't automate anything it can do with routines.  Alexa only seems capable of using the IR blaster if I give her voice commands.  I'd give a finger for the ability to add ""give command as though spoken"" in routine creation.   Anyone know of an IR Blaster that supports usage in routines?"
I'm talking like MW2 tactical nuke inbound loud. I have a convertible parked outside with the top down because the top can't go up as I have tires stacked on the inside.

"I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.  hopefully I posted this in the right r/\* group (apologies if not!)   I have a new Marshall Stanmore II Alexa Enabled speaker.  When I link my Spotify Account and try to use in on the Marshall speaker via voice commands such as “Play Spotify”, Alexa (cheerfully) tells me ""Spotify is not supported on this device.""   Spotify plays on the numerous amazon alexa devices, so I know it isn't my account. I am able to play through the Spotify app on my phone, but voice commands do not work whatsoever. I would think the whole feature of having the pricier Alexa speaker would be to have access to voice commands and not be restricted to play from the app every time. Has anyone else encountered this and worked around it?"

"My Echo Show original for some reason has decided to remove the entire ""center channel"" aka vocals for any music including Spotify and Pandora tracks. It sounds terrible because you can hear the compression and can tell an audio channel is completely missing. I am pretty sure it's not specifically left or right but the actual center channel like when you do vocal removals in Audition or sound editor program.      Is there some new 3D sound setting or something I am missing that is enabled by default? Checked settings on the Echo, could not find anything. I am not using groups or anything at the moment, just a standalone 1st gen white echo show."
"It just dawned on me that when I originally installed the Alexa app on my Android device, I would be notified with the same default notification sounds as my Echo Dot/Echo Show.  I'm pretty certain it would also speak/mirror whatever notification was playing on the Echo device such as if I had a reminder set I would hear the reminder on all of my devices including the Android phone with the Alexa app.    That hasn't happened for the last 2 years, but didn't know if it was something I did to turn it off or was this a change made by Amazon for the Alexa app.  I actually miss that feature if it was taken away.  Anyone else recollect the app being able to do this or know how to enable it again on an Android device?"

"I got my first Alexa in December 2017.  I now also have one Echo One, 2 dots, and an Echo Link for music.   However, Alexa still are still not understanding neither me or my spouse more than 60-70% of the time we make a request.   We ask Alexa to play the same 2 radio stations every day via TuneIn. And Alexa seems to never understand that we are looking for the same radio station as yesterday and last year and the year before.   We also had 3 lamps connected via Phillips Hue, you would think that Alexa would get better after 100s of ""Alexa, turn on/off bedroom light"", but she just never got better at understanding it. And any micro deviation, she would not understand.  I often read about Alexa's new features: Now Alexa can whisper, she can talk louder, she can tell more jokes, install her in Android, PC etc....   I just want her to work 99%. For me and my spouse.  I understand the Amazon team wants to launch new features, but I'm surprised that ""searches"" or ""queries"" are not getting better after 2 years of use.  Or is it just me?  ps. don't get me started on Amazon Echo Family/Household integration and the lack of ease...."

I never had this problem with my 2nd edition Alexas which I have now gifted to my parents and they love. I'm not sure why the newer gen alexas would suck soooo much more than the older, but they never play well together and hardly ever listen when I tell them to stop playing what they're doing. I have factory reset them all more than once, switched wifi networks, plugged them directly into the network, and no change anywhere. I am so fed up with them I could just buy bluetooth speakers and be 100% happier."
"When using the iHeartRadio skill the last couple weeks, initially Alexa will play the requested radio station. At some point, sometimes 5 minutes later, other times several hours later, during an ad break, it will switch stations over to some random iHeartRadio playlist, Elton John’s top hits, random podcasts, etc.  The app indicates that she correctly heard the requested station and no later commands changing it.  Any ideas why this might be happening, or where to even start looking to resolve it?"

I currently have Alexa connected via Bluetooth to a receiver that's plugged into a home sound system. The sound system has speakers in every room in the house that sound great however the bass is quite weak. I was wondering if I could hook up an echo sub in the main kitchen/living room area so that it could compliment the home sound speakers with some extra bass.
"Im just new to this and couldnt find the answer elsewhere. Basically,  I am trying to get alexa to do a conditional in a routine example.  I state a command for a routine to turn on my office. 1. Turn on lights 2. Turn on pc 3. For #3 i would like her to ask if she wants me to turn on the AC. I dont really need to have the AC sometimes if it is cold but I dont want to make a separate command just to excludeit. Would just like her to say something like ""do u want to turn on the ac?"" I'll either say yes or no and it will operate from that.  Is this possible?"
"I have a friend in Florida that tells me her echo says things without the wake word.  For example,  her echo dot is in the kitchen,  when she work up, she went into the kitchen and poured herself a cup of coffee.  As she was pouring it the echo dot came to life and said Good Morning and her name and it tell her what the temperature is and to drink plenty of water.   Today at 12 noon today the echo dot woke up again and said It's lunch time and drink plenty of water.  Again all this was without the wake word.  Does this seem like her echo dot was hacked or hi-jacked or is the echo dot getting smarter and can  sense sounds or movement to put out these random responses.     Anyone else experience random messages without a wake word that was not set as a routine?  I never heard of this before as she never invoked it with the wake word."
"Hey everyone! Just bought an Echo Dot and have some questions before it gets here.   My girlfriend wants to speak Spanish (Spain accent) with it and I’d like to have it in American English. Is there any way to manage multiple profiles with different settings on one device?   For example: when I speak to it in English I’d like to weather to be in Fahrenheit. If she speaks to it in Spanish, we’d like to weather to be in Celsius. Would this be possible?   Thanks for any help!"
Is there anyway via some API call to trigger Alexa to speak without being prompted? Thanks
When logging into the Alexa app it asks who you are and lists out multiple voice profiles. I feel so dumb even asking but I can delete other users voice profiles? I see how I can delete my own voice profile I can delete other voice profiles attached to my account?
"We have a number of Echo devices setup in groups and set as default speakers (e.g. you ask the Echo Show in the kitchen to play music, it automatically plays it on the First Floor group which includes several other devices.   The problem is that the currently playing info almost never shows in the Alexa app. About 80% of the time, the Alexa app is showing either nothing, or is ""stuck"" on something we played like 2 days ago (and shows it as paused) while we're listening to something completely different. There's no way to control track, volume, play/pause/etc from the app.  This is extremely frustrating because our speaker group includes an Echo Input which plays over our house audio system, so there are areas (like outside on the patio) where there is no Echo device in range to give voice inputs, and if the app doesn't work either...then you have no choice but to walk back into the house and find an Echo device if you want to do something simple like pause the music or skip to the next track.  While experimenting with this, I have a similar problem with the Amazon Music app. I used the Music app to start a song and connected to ""First Floor"" (the Alexa group) to play it. The music started playing, but the Music app showed nothing was playing at all *even though I had just used it to start the music.* In that case, the Echo devices were ALSO unaware that there was music playing. So I had absolutely no way to stop the music until I told the Echo devices to play something else, then I could command that to stop playing.  So all in all, Amazon's network music control code seems to be buggy as hell and the majority of the time we have no way to control the music except via voice. Does anyone else experience this and do you have any suggestions on how to make it better?"
"I have a lengthy routine scheduled to help Me get our the door in the morning by reminding me to get in the shower, feed the dog, etc. It takes about two hours.    this morning I accidentally triggered the routine to start again - by pressing the “play routine” button halfway.   It now plays the two routines simultaneously- is there a way to stop one of them from happening?"
Is there a way to switch from my HDMI spitter input (HDMI game) to HDMI1 (CEC) which my firetv stick to connected to.   Every time I try it says input not supported but works with the remote when I say “switch to firetv stick or switch to PlayStation).   I’m connected to a CEC port on the firetv stick and the Sonos is only connected via optical cable to the tv.   No ARC.  Only these two hdmi ports.   Weird thing is I was watching this [video](https://youtu.be/h_Vtwzbcoyo ) and it kept triggering Alexa.    Then at one point it SWITCHED hdmi ports from my splitter to HDMI1 witch my firetv stick is connected to.   I’ve been sitting here for an hour like a fool playing back the video on repeat trying to trigger it again with no luck.   Any help would be appreciated.
"Subject pretty much says it all.   I want to get my Alexa to play music by the Mongolian Metal band The Hu, but, of course if I say ""Play music by The Hu""  I get music by ""The Who"".    Ok band just not what I'm after.    Thoughts?"
I was just going thru the Communication Settings in the Alexa app and I noticed Group Drop In has been added. I was just in the Communication Settings on Wednesday and that was not there.  http://imgur.com/a/MWJZIN1
So this is driving me nuts . I tend to sleep threw one of my alarms so I used to set my phone Alexa and my echo . Some how my Alexa app was set to do not disturb... (my phone isn’t set to do not disturb) . Someone help before I throw this iPhone in the dumpster!!!🤯😡🤬🤬🤬
I asked the cat if he wanted to go out and Alexa responded with “I like you... but as a friend”  Genius
Went to set her to guard when I left and she didn’t know what I was talking about. I’ve used it many times before but all the settings are missing from the app. Anyone know what happened?
"The other day Alexa asked if I wanted to get some reminders throughout the day since I'm working from home. Y'know, stuff like every hour or so to get up and stretch, drink enough water, things like that. I said yes. Even if I'm not going to stop to do everything it says (I already planned out dinner thanks) it was pretty helpful overall and not at all obtrusive.  But it's Saturday and it woke me up from a dang fine nap to tell me to plan dinner for after work. I don't remember the name of the feature so I don't know how to turn it off. It's not a skill (at least I don't see anything that sounds right listed there). When I google ""Alexa Work From Home,"" most of the results are just reminding me that it's listening to everything I say."
"Hey guys, I have an Alexa Dot at my office and 5 Hue bulbs (Gen 3, no bluetooth).  I already have my bulbs at home set up with the Hue app, which are controlled by Google Home.  When I try to sync the Alexa app with the Hue app, Alexa adds the lights from home, and I can't choose my office lights.  Is there a work around? Or a way to add the lights to Alexa without the Hue app?"
"My mother doesn't use Apple products but she's been complaining that sometimes Alexa won't play a song and then says something about iTunes.  I couldn't reproduce the iTunes thing, and she played music for me just fine, always playing it via my mother's Amazon Music account.  However, I did ask Alexa to play NPR News and she said something like, ""Playing NPR News Now from Apple Podcast."" So why would she do that if my mother doesn't have an Apple product or an Apple account?"
"I have an Echo Dot  and today it started playing from Spotify without any command. Sometimes I ask for it via voice, sometimes I send via my computer or phone. Today I was having breakfast and when I returned to my room, the music was playing. I opened Spotify on my phone and it wasn't the same song (I know sometimes there's a delay), and the last time I listened to Spotify was yesterday at afternoon on my computer.   There's more: sometimes when I'm at my room and ask for Alexa anything she can't hear me, and I have to repeat. Plus, my Alexa is set on British English and my mother language is other, so it couldn't be my family pranking on me for any reason, or Alexa hearing anything and misunderstanding It's also the only Alexa/Echo device in the house.   I really don't know what happened, It was playing the same playlist as yesterday, but I found it very very weird. It's a small home, but I cant believe it might have misunderstood the words/voice, as I already said it sometimes don't hear me calling ""Alexa"" even when I'm at my room.  Has anyone ever experienced something like this? What could have happened?"
"And she plays Mr. Brightside from some dude named Gino Colleti.   Why does google home play The Killers when asked the same command, but Alexa plays a song with just 7000 listens in spotify!!!    (And I bet those are all accidental plays from Alexa users, Gino Colletti other songs have &gt;1000 plays.)"
"Hi. My internet was a little flaky for a while both accessing from my PC and Alexa. So I asked Alexa, what is the internet status? Just checking if Alexa understands that question. And I got a response I can't understand. Here it is, as I recorded on my mobile - [https://soundcloud.com/lawyer-man-118077125/internets-what](https://soundcloud.com/lawyer-man-118077125/internets-what) . The best I can make of it is - the internet's living number/member is Sid/sit. What IS that???"
Hey everyone! So I started streaming and I want to use my Alexa to play songs through my headphones so my viewers to hear. I would rather keep this wireless if I can!  Thanks!
"Hi all  I have a new yamaha AV  that clearly states it supports Spotify. It has a seperate Spotify mode and it says it supports it on the box and the device itself. Google assistant gives me no issues but since the device is also Musiccast and Alexa-compatible (and never says it's compatible with Google assistant), I figured I'd give that a try.  I have a Spotify premium subscription, linked the receiver to my living room without issue and linked my Spotify account. I also set it as default music provider and disabled and enabled the skill. Now when I ask it to olay something on Spotify in the living room (speaker group), it says the device does not support Spotify. Well, it clearly does as I can stream to it from the Spotify app itself.  Am I missing something here?"
Just a bit of fun between my girlfriend and I to remind us to do pushups or sit-ups once an hour to keep us in relative shape during lockdown.
"I was just setting my phone down before bed onto my wireless charging dock and just realized that they both have the same basic shape (wireless dock is obviously thinner) and plug into the wall.  Wouldn't it be great if the next version of the Echo Dot allowed you to place your phone on top and charge or wirelessly?  Obvious design flaws may be that you can't access any of the buttons on top but like, raise your hand if you actually use those? I'm thinking the only real shit part would be that you can't tap to snooze your alarm. Thoughts?"
"It only happens when Alexa is talking, and in both english and portuguese (my native language). Some words just ends with some little whistle sound, almost like a light interference sound when you put a microphone in the front of a speaker.   When I play any music, I can't notice it.   I know the quality sound of Echo Dot isn't the best, but is this normal?"

"I’ll try to make this brief and relatively clear, hopefully this is the right place to get some help...   So we’re setting up our tv room and we have a Sceptre 55” dumb tv connected to an Xbox one (hdmi) and a Wuhome sound bar (optical).   We just got an echo dot and set up Alexa to turn on the Xbox, which works great! The issue is that the tv doesn’t turn on and the sound bar is in the way of the IR signal coming from the Xbox to turn off the tv.   We got an Amazon Firestick to add Alexa automation to the tv so we can tell Alexa to turn it off through hdmi cec on the tv, cec is turned on in tv settings, the tv and fire tv show up on the Alexa app, but when I tell Alexa to turn on the tv she says there’s an issue with the device connected to the tv which I can only assume is the fire stick.  What are we missing? Is there another step to connecting the hdmi cec to the fire stick and to the echo dot?  TL;DR can’t get device controls to work with our tv on Alexa"
I seem to recall reading that Alexa devices can speak in a Southern US Accent. Is that possible? I cant seem to find it on the language or voice settings.
Every single time. Obviously that’s what I mean. It didn’t used to do this. It does it for other things too - but not some things and I can’t find any reason or rhyme to it. I’ve checked my voice history to see what it *thinks* I’m saying and it’s hearing everything absolutely correctly. Smart my ass.
Hi. This might be quite difficult to explain/ask... But I'm wondering if it's possible to change the name that is assigned to each Alexa... I'm not asking how to change Alexa's name (such as echo or computer) but asking can I change who is assigned to an Alexa. Some background might help.... In my house I have 3 Alexi (plural of Alexa obviously) on 3 separate floors. Now when the downstairs one calls the 1st floor it says my name (I.e. The name registered to the account) is calling. Is there any way to change this to simply..... Downstairs Alexa is calling.... Or Top Floor Alexa is calling for example. That way I can know which Alexa is calling me.  I hope that makes sense. Thanks.
"My mum and her boyfriend live together with my younger sister. My younger sister and mum have concerns about setting up their alexas because they fear the boyfriend is going to listen in (he has a tendency to be quite nosy - we are working on it please no comments on this) even with the ping of the alexas when drop in is active they’re still worried.   We know you can turn off drop in mode, but if he has the app aswell is it possible for him to just reenable it on all the devices? Is there anyway to lock this so he doesn’t have access to this?"
My mum wants her alexas set up to be able to be used as a one way intercom into rooms so she can say “dinners ready” ext.   However. Her boyfriend has a bad tendency of being very nosey. And she doesn’t want him to be able to use alexas to drop in and then be able listen in on conversations. Even with the ping the Alexa does she’s still worried she’d not hear it. (Also I understand this an unhealthy concern in their relationship. We are working on that but please don’t dwell on that!)   I was testing it out with my own one in my flat. Talking from my phone to my Alexa and the “drop in feature” appears to let’s you listen in as an open communication between both devices.   Is there a One way system instead?
"At my wits end with the Alexa Grouping issues with 2 Hue Bridges.   A few weeks ago I was struggling to create a group of lights that I had on my 2nd Hue bridge. Anytime I created an Alexa group for that room I would save the group and then look, and it will have added random lights from all over my house   Looking into that it looked liked Alexa was getting confused with names that were similar on my main bridge.  So yesterday my Main Hue Bridge died, so since I was starting from scratch I decided to really focus on the naming of the new lights and now there should be NO confusion between light named on the two bridges.  I went back added all my groups, everything from my main bridge grouped fine as it was before. Then I tried to Group with the 8 lights on my 2nd bridge, saved the group same issue random lights added to the new group.  Has anyone figured out how to do this? Is the Adding my 2nd bridge to SmartThings and using the SmartThings skill the best bet?"
"I have a fire tablet that has a camera on it, and the app on my phone. Is there a way to use the camera on the tablet to see into a room from my phone. I was painting a room at work and then went for dinner. I thought it would be brilliant if I could look at the wall from my tablet to see if the paint had dried.... Xxx"
I have a firestick and my biggest complaint is the screensaver kicking in when the device is idle or worse while the Plex app is playing music.  While my Plex app is playing music the screen goes to the Alexa system screensaver with the default pics and Alexa tips etc. I just want to continue to view the Plex app with the song and album info. Any tips?
"I don’t understand. How hard can it truly be to have a smooth experience for multiple users on echo devices?! I mean, really?!   What is the point of an Amazon Household on Alexa if not to share smart groups/devices??  And what the fuck is the point of signing in with my partners login but saying it’s me logging in if the stuff that looks like it’s shared in app doesn’t work when talking to Alexa? I mean, come on. How hard is this, really???  I have to have my own account logged in to get the lights to work correctly, but I can’t have speaker groups. If I want speaker groups, the lights aren’t going to work.   Does this suck for other people trying to have multiple users or am I just doing something wrong? I don’t get it."
"Hi All, do anyone know if “nook price guide” for animal crossing got Japanese version? Or similar Alexa skills can support Japanese language? Thanks"
"Hi,  I'd like to send my grandparents an echo show so we can drop in on them for video calls (too hard to accept calls with other devices).  Someone can help with set up.     My plan is to create an amazon account for them, and log in to alexa on my phone (different city) to help manage settings after setup.  I don't use alexa for anything else so don't mind that it's my number associated and I can just log out of the app when not dropping in. That way I think other family members (contacts in my phone) can drop in without it ringing me. Not sure what other complications there would be.  &amp;#x200B;  Does this make sense? Is it possible to set up like this from afar or does my phone need to ever be on the same wifi as the device?  Thanks!"
"I’m currently on FaceTime with someone on my phone, if i tell Alexa to call some that’s not the person I’m talking to does it hang up the FaceTime I’m on?"
"Anyway to do this? I have my photos getting backed up to my Amazon Photos, but I don't need everyone is my household to have access to them. How do I turn this off?"
"In this case, if I ask for an image of Baby Yoda for my daughter, I get uploaded Photos displayed. Even when I have removed the images, I get the ""No photos to display"" message.  Is this a wide spread issue? I can get other images (Dogs, etc) but a lot default to Photos."
Does anyone know if Alexa can integrate with Nextcloud and the photos app?  Or display photos from a local NAS?
"My @alexa had lost the ability to understand the word ""stop"". If I start a timer it continues beeping until unplugged. Pauses for a sec when I say ""Alexa stop"" and then resumes beeping. This has happened twice in the past few days. She's unplugged now. Hardware is an original Echo. Anyone else?"
"Is the only way to limit certain alexa devices (such as perhaps an Echo 5 on a guest room nightstand) from having access to the same smart home lighting, routine, etc. functions as other echo devices in the home?  Or is the only way still to have those echo devices connected to a second amazon account / alexa login which then do not have smart home devices connected?   Ideally I'd like to limit stuff like light and routine control on a device-by-device basis (so the guests could say, still control the lights in THAT ROOM ONLY) but not have control over commanding devices in the rest of the home.  I hope this makes sense.  Seems like a cool idea though maybe tougher to implement in theory."
"So I just got a notification on all of my Echo's, that woke up half the house at 6am. And it was a freaking advertisement for some nonsense.   This is unacceptable, and I did not agree to get served ads at your whim. If this is a wide spread issue I'm filing a class action."
"Hello, I’m using a new Fire 7 tablet and have finally linked my spotify to Alexa. But every time I ask Alexa to play something on spotify nothing happens. She’ll say “Playing (Insert song/Playlist) on Spotify” then nothing. When I have her open the Spotify app and play something she’ll do as she’s told but as soon as she says she’s playing it, the app will force stop. Don’t know what’s wrong with it."
"I'm used to being able to play/pause YouTube on the fire TV by telling my echo dot, but this hasn't been working the last week or so. I checked, and my echo dot + fire TV are still linked. I can tell Alexa ""play the expanse"" and she plays it. While the expanse is playing, I can play/pause with voice commands. I can still tell Alexa ""open YouTube"" and she opens it. The only thing she won't do now is play/pause YouTube. Even if I hold the mic button on my fire TV remote and say ""play/pause"" Alexa says ""resume/pause is not supported"". What gives? Hopefully this functionality returns soon because it's handy when I'm cooking, taking out the trash, heading to/from the restroom, or just don't feel like finding the remote."
"I just set up an Echo and I intend to use it primarily for playing music. I got it linked with my spotify account, but was disappointed that it didn't support anything like ""Alexa, save this song to my favorites playlist"". I did some searching, and found [this!](https://www.amazon.com/CAct-Song-Keeper-for-Spotify/dp/B079F69G67) skill that does exactly what I was looking for, but it is ""not currently available"", and I can't find any further information on it.  Does anyone know of any skills for spotify that might allow for this type of thing, or any other music services I could use that would be able to do this?"
"I wonder if amazon has stats on how many people say please or thank you to Alexa. And if so, I wonder if a large percentage are Canadian.   Do you happen to say please or thank you to your device? I often do. I wondered if she’d take it when I’m snuggled up in bed and I say “Alexa, turn off the bedroom light, please” because my light is called “bedroom light” and not “bedroom light please”. But she does do it. Equivalently, I can say “Alexa, please turn off the bedroom light”. Then I often find myself so grateful because I was so cozy in bed (and now didn’t have to get up to shut off the light) that I end up saying “Alexa, thank you”."
"I was excited to get the Studio and link it to my Fire TV cube for better sound.  However, after several months I still have daily issues.   Does anybody else have these problems?  Note: a few weeks ago i did a reset on the Studio and did not re-link it to Fire TV for a few weeks.   During this time all of my issues went away, and they all returned after I linked them again.  \- Randomly, when I put on a TV program through an app, (today it was Netflix, but also Hulu, IMDBtv, etc), the TV program will play in sort of a jumpy fast forward mode -- the image only, the sound will be mostly okay, but of course, the sound is completely off from the video.   Rarely, I can just pause and play again and it will work okay.   Otherwise, I just give up and watch a different program - even a different program on the same app, and it plays fine.   Then in a day or so I'll go back to the program that would not play correctly and watch it and it's fine.  \- Apps like IMDBtv that have advertisements - the audio for the advertisement will play but the video of the TV program keeps going.  So when the ad audio finishes, i have to pause, then the audio keeps playing for a while while the video is paused.   When the audio catches up and finally pauses, then I press play and the TV program audio and video are matched up again.    Then the next commercial comes on and I go through the whole pause/wait/restart again.   On IMDB this happens 100% of the time.  These seem like some pretty serious bugs that Amazon should have fixed by now."
"With April nearing its end, we saw Amazon release four newsletters consisting of new–or newly promoted–Alexa commands. Collectively, there are 83 total features to try out.   While that number alone may sound daunting, I’ve compiled the top five features I think are neat below so you can quickly and easily get the latest info.    [https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/alexa-tips-and-tricks-april-2020/](https://www.smarthomeexplained.com/alexa-tips-and-tricks-april-2020/)   So go ahead and give these new commands a try. Would love your thoughts on if you like them."
" hi guys i have a problem with alexa, if i tell alexa play ""song"" on Spotify , it just open Spotify on the last Song i have listen on Spotify and play It.  But it can't play the Song i say. Do you know how i can solve this problem ?"
My wife and I have a shared google calendar where we add in a meal plan for each day of the week's dinner. We would like for one of us (or my son) to be able to ask Alexa what is for dinner and have her tell us the appropriate meal that we have planned for that evening. Any thoughts on the easiest way to do this?
"I don't see a setting for this and don't know why this started all of sudden two days ago.  ""Alexa turn the lamp on.""  ""You want me to turn the lamp on, right?""  The downward spiral of Amazon Alexa and Fire TV continues at a rapid pace.   Considering switching to another smart home service.   Another recent bug is when watching via a tv app with commercials, the commercial audio will play while the TV program video continues to play.   If the commercial is twenty seconds, when it's over, the TV audio will be twenty seconds off the TV program unless I press pause, then the video will pause and i wait twenty seconds for audio to stop playing and catch up with the video before pressing resume.   Next commercial, go through that whole ordeal again.   It seems like Amazon isn't testing software updates any longer, just releasing and hoping for the best."
"Me: Alexa, play [insert band and album] on Spotify. Alexa: now playing [band and album] on Spotify.. *proceeds to play anything but [band and album] whilst my blood pressure skyrockets*  (forgive me if I've missed any rules or posts about this, I'm too incensed to look)"
"Is there a way to turn off Alexa's help?  I've been using Alexa for 4 years now.  I don't need explanations on how to do things.  Whenever she miss hears me she goes into dissertations about what could be wrong and it's really annoying.  Example:  This morning she disconnected from a bluetooth speaker and I said reconnect.  She auto-connected in the middle of my phrase.  Then she went into a whole schpeal about connecting to a new blue tooth speaker and trouble shooting options.  Told her to stop, and she stopped both the music and the schpeal."
I just got the echo dot how do I connect it to my iPhone sms. It keeps telling me the contact needs to have Alexa communication app??? In other words Alexa can’t do much with your messaging and calls if the other contact doesn’t have the app?
"Truth is advertising here, it’s actually my wife’s phone.  The situation is as follows:  We have three Alexa devices in the house,  a fire stick, an Echo Dot, and an Echo Show.  Both my wife and I have iPhone 11s with the Alexa app.  My child (like many of yours) has been stuck in the house, with school canceled, while my wife is working from home (I still drive 40 minutes to work each way, joy)  My kiddo and her cousin have been using the Echo Shows (one in each house) every day for hours at a time.  Here is where the problem comes in.  The Alexa app on my wife’s phone will show the incoming call.  Sometimes it’s listed as a video call and when the kiddo answers on the Show, my wife’s phone will shut up.  Other times, the call will be listed as an Audio call and even when the kiddo answers the Echo show, the Alexa App on my wife’s phone will not shut up, she has to physically acknowledge it, which can be a problem if it is out of reach and she is on a work video conference.  This same thing is happening on the other end, so my Sister in Laws phone is doing the same thing while she is working from home.  Please help.  It is greatly appreciated!"
"I’m new to the whole Alexa smart home integration and am loving the multi room music. There are two things I’d love to figure out.  1. Is there a wireless speaker that would pair with Alexa and work with the “Alexa, play Spotify everywhere” function. I essentially would like a nice speaker that I can move from my home gym to my back patio as needed.  2. I have an Alexa device of some kind in each of our bedrooms, kitchen, and living room. I recently installed ecobee5 Smart Thermostat with Voice Control on our main level and upstairs. This next level thermostat allows you to play music from it as well, but I can’t figure out how to pair it with the “Play everywhere” function. It seems to be only one or the other. Has anyone figured out how to do this?  Thanks for any advice!"
"First of all, I don't know if this is the right place for this question.  &amp;#x200B;  Do you know if there is a temperature and humidity sensor that is compatible with alexa (if the humidity is higher than X%, it activates a routine)?"
"I’ve had my Echo for a while now and I love it, but just last night she stopped responding to “stop” - wouldn’t stop a timer or music. I had to go in the app and stop the timer. For music I said pause and it’s paused :/. I tried unplugging and plugging it back in and have the same issue - can anyone help? Thanks!  Edit - she is hearing “Alexa”, just doesn’t do anything after I say “stop”. Seems like all other commands are working fine!"
"I don't own an Alexa device myself, I dont know how it works.  Any ideas, tips ? Does it involve ""hacking"" or can it be done legally ?  For  example, how would I program his Alexa to greet him with a ""Good  morning Patrick. Happy birthday. Your daughter asked me to play this  song for you"", or anything of the kind ?  My father is super geeky and it'd go straight to his heart.  Thanks"
I have multiple AC's in the house which I control using Alexa and it also gets confused and does weird stuff and at the end says I didn't find device named something  Before it was AC-1   AC-2    Now it is    Front AC and Back AC   I don't know how to name devices if you guys have like a naming system please let me know thanks
"I have many smart devices connected to Alexa and grouped up in rooms. I have an Echo in many rooms, not all of them.  When I say ""Alexa, turn the light off"", Alexa turns off not just the light, but also a smart plug and the Nvidia shield that are in the same room... If I specify the ""name"" of the lightbulb, it doesn't happen.  Any way to avoid that other than having to spell out the name of the specific devices?"
Does it make a difference whether both echo devices in a stereo pair have the same wake word or not? Thanks
I have both my echos on the same network however they are connected to different access points. When trying to pair it will let me select one but will say network error for the other. Same happens if I select them the other way around too. I can play music on each one individually through spotify connect but cant get the multi room working
"My parents have called me into the kitchen to ask for my help with our Alexa, when they asked it to play Radio 2, as they often do, it started playing a dutch radio station and now will no longer pick up uk radio stations. Any ideas?"
"On the dot every morning at 3:00 AM my Alexa changes the volume to the loudest setting, regardless of what I had it on before. Has this happened to anyone else? Is there any way to fix it?"
"Did you know you can whisper to Alexa and she'll not only lower the volume on your Echo device but also whisper back to you? Or that you can now have Alexa fire photon torpedoes?    This week's newsletter by Amazon features both additions and more with what's new with Alexa. And since the newsletter is pretty slim in detail with the what/how-to type info, I've taken a stab at reviewing each new command.

"Hi everyone! Recently installed a patio in my backyard and i'm trying to figure out the audio. I have a house with a Echo Show 2, Echo Show 5 (i think thats what its called), 4 dots, and a original spot. Multi room music with Spotify works awesome! I would love to create a group where music will play both inside and outisde at the same time. I found the Echo Link Amp, which seems to solve my issues. I can run the AMP inside, then bring copper outside to power mounted speakers. The cost is kind of turning me off on this idea, so i was researching Portable Speakers. Does anyone know of a portable speaker that supports multiroom music? The Amazon Tap does not seem to have this functionality based off the reviews. Or, does anyone know of a 2 channel amp that would support multiroom music? Thank you for any advice or input!"
"I find it quite odd, in the settings of the Alexa app for this device that I have the option to turn on the 24 hour clock display on the Echo Dot 3rd Generation when there is no display at all for this device.   On the Echo Flex in the settings for the LED Display, I can   control the clock display and the brightness of the clock which that doesn't even have a display.   Does anyone else have this as well?  http://imgur.com/a/XMDDOg5  *Edit* I just checked the settings of my Fire TV and the incoming call ringer is toggled on however I don't receive any kind of notification for any incoming calls. I have the Echo Connect connected to my home phone and all the smart speakers ring a soft tone and she announces the caller, just not on the Fire TV.   http://imgur.com/a/IRHjqS0"
"I just want voice commands.  I don't want a conversation.  I use the alexa windows app and it's great for controlling smarthome.  My only problem is she is so fkn loud and everytime I'm listening to music on my speakers, everytime I request a song she screams 'OK I WILL PLAY THAT SONG FOR YOU' in the loudest, long winded way.  I have brief mode on already.  I only want her to talk when she is actually asking something, not confirming... is there any way to get her to shut the hell up?!  If not is there any other ecosystems that offer the same without the sass?"
"Anyone else have an option for LED Display with an Echo (not Dot) 3rd Gen? When I click on it in the Alexa app, I have the option to enable a 24 hour clock, but nothing shows. I know the dot has a clock, is this just a bug in the software showing an option that isn't actually available to me?"
I bought my mom two echos for Christmas. They are linked to my account despite me trying to register them to hers. I get her notifications and activity history. I’d like to separate the echos from my account. She is included on my prime account under her own email. I’m not sure if that impacts this?
"Like others I have been hoping Alexa will one day read Calendar events without being asked. This occurred late Saturday night, once. Only thing I can think of that might have triggered it on our side is that a TV is in the same room as the Alexa (and was on) and its possible that she heard a request. We've seen that before.  Wondering if there is either a new update I'm not aware of or if anyone knows more about how this can be used if it is really a thing.  This would be so useful for so many people."

"Today, trying to add a switch, and discover devices from Alexa, it 'discovered' our printer. It's an Older model) Brother printer that works with AirPrint and Morphia. But did not expect Alexa would add it. I don't have any skills from Brother, so it must've found it via UPnP or Zeroconf (Bonjour / Avahi).  Question: What can Alexa do with this?"
"I have Amazon music unlimited, and lately when I ask alexa to play an album where the album name is also the name of a song on said album, all I get is that song.. Example: Album If You Could Read My Mind by Gordon Lightfoot.. All I'll get is the one song.. Anyone else..?"

"My Echo Dot came today. She's having Wi-Fi issues.  Earlier, I had her registered to a dual-band network, but it'd list her as ""offline"" in the app whenever it was on. Whilst registering, the app did say that it couldn't connect to the Wi-Fi, but I dismissed this as I thought I'd be able to change it later.  I was wrong. It did warn that whilst it was offline, some settings would be disabled, I didn't realise that also meant the option to change the connected Wi-Fi.  &amp;#x200B;  I've since split the Wi-Fi into single connections for 2.4GHz and 5GHz, as a friend suggested that. She's still having issues, saying that her Wi-Fi isn't enabled in any capacity. I can't find the setting to turn it on. All the help I can find on the app or online is for changing Wi-Fi networks, which doesn't help at all. Right after I enter the Wi-Fi password, she tells me Wi-Fi isn't enabled and to check general the help. She won't even register herself to the app anymore.  &amp;#x200B;  I can't figure this out at all. Has anyone else had this issue?"
"So I bought a new Echo (Gen3) a couple days ago and previously had an Echo Dot (Gen2), my Samsung TV keeps trying to connect to the echo (keeps detecting echo wirelessly) and was wondering if there is a way to disable communications between the two, possibly turning off Bluetooth? they’ve never been connected before and it was never a problem when I had the Dot! I would really appreciate the help 😅"
"Spotify account problem.. playing on Alexa devices?!  Soooo I bought an Alexa on my dad’s Amazon account years ago. No one in my family had one aside from me. I connected my Spotify to my account. Then this last year, my sister bought an Alexa from my dad’s Amazon account. Now whenever she plays music on her Alexa it automatically defaults to using my Spotify account. I’ll be listening to music during a workout or something then my music just turns off. I can then see that she’s listening and I feel bad stopping her music so I just let her listen. But this is getting annoying lol... anyone had this problem? How do you fix it?"
"Hey guys I have a question,  I own an Echo Plus and two other family members have Dots. Is there any way we can arrange them so that they are under the same network (for smart home integration) whilst we get to use our different Spotify accounts and so on?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!"

"Hello,  I had to unplug my hive hub and hue hub today to a different location and now alexa is being awkward with hive commands.  I can no longer say alexa turn my heating off and it does it, instead she says you have hive enabled do you want to open it and then if I try instead alexa ask hive to turn my heating off she just beeps at me but doesn't do it.  Any ideas on how to fix? Tbh I want to get the original commands working as I don't want to ""ask hive"" to do anything.  Thank you"
"When I tell Alexa to play something, very often I get a very annoying cover version of a song, not the original. There is a perfect combination of worlds to get it to play what I want, but it's not obvious how to ask - even stating the album and artist often results in a techno version of a Disney classic, for example.     Any tip will be appreciated."

"For some reason when i tell Spotify to play everywhere,  only my echo flex devices output music,  but my echo show doesn't..i have to select echo show specifically but then no music comes out of the Flex devices..

"We got my kid the rainbow echo dot for his birthday because he loves going to peoples houses and asking it to sing songs to him. Both people we know with an Alexa we’ve just had to say something simple like “Alexa play if you’re happy and you know it” and at both houses it autos to the Sesame Street version by Elmo and friends.  However with ours we can’t figure out how to get it to do this? In fact we can’t get it to sing ANY nursery rhymes at all. Each time it’s asked it just says she doesn’t know those songs or can’t find it. They’re not like Frozen songs, just things like If you’re happy and you know it or coming round the mountain.  I downloaded the Sesame Street skill but it’s just a small Elmo hide and seek game and doesn’t have anything to do with songs.  I tried getting it to play music from my amazon music app but I can’t get the stupid echo to stop defaulting to ihearteadio even though my app is set to default to Amazon Radio. And for some reason if we ask it to play “a kids radio station” it keeps playing r&amp;b from iheartradio. Google just keeps directing me back to the Sesame Street skill which isn’t what I’m wanting.  It’s connected to my amazon account and we have Prime as well as the free year of free time if that matters."

Sadly I don't have any plugs in the hall so the Echo Flex is out, that would have been perfect by the sound of it. Any suggestions?"

"So let's say I'm watching TV and a commercial comes on and says, ""You can order pizza using your Alexa!""  My Alexa device will hear the word Alexa and make the familiar sound to acknowledge (the same sound I would hear if I talked to Alexa), **BUT** the blue ring doesn't light up.  So my Alexa is able to ***recognize*** that someone is calling her name, but is smart enough to ***distinguish*** it from real-life because it's from the TV (maybe Alexa recognizes audio frequencies from TVs or something).  What's the point of this?  Does this happen to anyone else?"
"Hello! I’m a researcher from the University of Liverpool, UK. We are currently researching virtual assistants like Alexa and how they relate to employment and Accent.   We are investigating this to analyse how useful and beneficial virtual assistants like Alexa are at work, and also to analyse the commonly reported problem of people with certain accents finding it harder for virtual assistants to interpret their commands.    Once we have collected enough data it will be forwarded to the R&amp;D divisions of all the relevant companies, like Amazon. So if you help us out you may actually have an impact on how virtual assistants are designed!

"I've been having on and off issues with my two Echo Dot Gen 3's and Echo Sub set up as a ""pair"" in Alexa.  Spotify was slow to react, the speakers would occasionally ignore my commands altogether, and in general it just felt like it wasn't working right.  Well, I figured I would unpair and repair the speakers.  Whenever I clicked on one of the speakers, half of the remaining speakers would gray out and say ""network error"".    It seems to me that Alexa wants all of the paired speakers to be connected to the same access point and I'm not sure how to make that happen.  I have 3 TP-Link Omada AP's, one on each floor, all controlled by software running on my PC.  The AP closest to the two Echo Dots also has a metal beam between the AP and the Dots which might be causing it to connect to the AP directly above it in the Kitchen, but I'm pretty sure the other Dot and Sub are still connected to the Basement AP.  I suppose I could mount a WAP not connected to the mesh network strictly for the 2.1 setup but that seems like a stupid amount of work for 2 $20  Echo Dots and a Sub.  Anyone else have Echo's paired with mesh network setups?  Any best practices to share?"
"I have setup my echo dot exactly the same as my main echo using the same app, same address, yet when I ask it something simple like playing radio one, like I do on my other one, instead of playing bbc it plays some random foreign station.   How do I stop this happening?"

Is there a simple way to automate this? I would do this for some 10-15 reminders-sets a week."
"I have 4 Alexa devices on my home network, and have had this setup for a long time. But lately, over the last few days, Alexa is getting much slower to respond, and its to the point where she just drops out periodically. Just asking for the weather can take several seconds before the light ring comes on, and 10 or more seconds to get a response. I have also noticed that Alexa is getting confused about which speaker to answer or play on. I did have all my speakers in one group, and at one point I had specified a preferred speaker, but I undid all that when I realized how it actually worked. But it still will sometimes answer me from a far away speaker, or play music on a far speaker. This seems especially true if that speaker is already playing music. It should ask me if I want to play from the nearer speaker. Instead it plays music on the far speaker. All of these problems are relatively new. Any help appreciated...  FWIW: my home wifi is very fast, like 200 MBps according to Speedtest."

"So we've had an Alexa for a while, but figured while im here posting something else, I may as well post this, but when we first got her, my mother when asked by Alexa to state her name, said ""The Momma"" and I, facepalmed at the reply because I knew this would cause issues (she has since been simply referred to as ""The""). However, the problem resides when trying to rename her on the alexa app. It's grey'd out (well, not really grey, but, it's a darker shade of blue and it's not tappable) despite that being the only way I see to do it, I can change any other person's name, but hers, why is that?"
"Is there a way to get alexa to speak the name of the person who said the command for routines/custom phrases?   Eg,    Fred: Good morning  Alexa: Good morning, \[Fred\] currently it's 78 degrees. blah blah  but if someone else said it, she'd say their name instead?"
"I usually listen to Apple Music on Alexa. I have a bunch of really large playlists and it sucks to ask Alexa to play my playlist (which it will do just fine), but I cannot get it to shuffle the songs. This has the effect of essentially listening songs at the top of the playlist as opposed to songs mixed throughout. It is really painful if you have an album in the playlist that you have now heard a million times.  Has there been any improvements on shuffling Apple Music playlists?"
"This morning at 12:30 am, I woke up to loud electronic music. Living in a townhouse, I assumed it was my neighbor since my bedroom shares a wall with them. It continued to go on for another 20 minutes that my husband decided to get up to go knock on their door. On his way downstairs he stopped and said “Alexa, turn off.” Holy crap, it was our Echo blasting the music  from our downstairs kitchen, not our poor neighbor. We’re been asleep upstairs for a couple of hours prior and no one else lives with us besides out 5 month old who sleeping in another room. We felt horrible and embarrassed, but here’s what’s really crazy. I went to check my Alexa app to see what was playing or what command was given and there was only my husband command to turn off. You can hear the weird music playing in the background, but there was no record of anything else. The last command made prior to this incident was at 4:30pm.   I wrote to Amazon about this and changed my password, but does anyone know what caused this? Were we hacked? Was it a glitch? Has this happened to anyone else?"
"It is so frustrating when i ask a simple question like”Alexa, what time is it?” and she gives me the time and then starts saying “By the way, did you know you can set Alexa to bla bla bla”. Then ai want to interrupt her and tell her the shut up otherwise she will continue talking longer.   Thanks."
"Just want to make sure I’m not crazy. I’ve been changing volume in the app on my living room Echo Plus second gen for the entire time I’ve had it. Now I go to change it in the app again and [I get this](https://imgur.com/gallery/xTrpkis)... What’s up with this? Is this a new restriction or is it like my WiFi/did I mess with a setting?   If this is actually a new thing then I’m super displeased. So if I’m upstairs and remember my volume is loud and a guest is sleeping in my living room, I now either have to blast this person for 1sec while I try to lower the volume quickly or creep downstairs and manually lower the volume?? That’s extremely unreasonable."
I’m slowly starting to automate my house and I have multiple Alexa speakers distributed throughout the house. My next step is to install door locks that lock and unlock through Alexa. My issue is I have an echo speaker on my front porch to control the lights and play music from. Is it possible to limit the controls that this Echo can access? I wouldn’t want a stranger walking up to my porch and asking Alexa to unlock the door allowing anyone to break in. I also don’t want the Echo dot in an upstairs bedroom to be able to turn off the lights in the basement. Is it possible to do this without creating a separate email account for each of these echos? Thank you
"Anybody have a fix for this? (at night, I have nighttime mode scheduled.) screen will go back to “day mode” and light up bright, for a few seconds then change back to night mode intermittently. Pretty obnoxious."
"I cannot seem to get Alexa to respond to “turn on” or a percentage when turning on the fan LIGHT. I have the fan switch and light switch installed. The fan switch is labeled “Bedroom Fan”, the light switch is “Bedroom Fan Light”. Alexa has never responded correctly, it always thinks I’m talking about the Fan, not the Fan light, even though I make it clear. I have many smart products connected to alexa, and they all work except this. Side note, I have idevices switches in my living room, and the exact same phrasing (Substitute Bedroom for Living Room), and it works flawlessly. Any ideas?!"
"For example, I used to put ""Sleep Playlist on loop"" in a routine and it would loop my sleep playlist. Now the Alexa app won't accept ""on loop"" anymore. Is there a new command or what are you using?"
"I downloaded the Alexa app on my iPhone 6s, just to test out the features to see if it was worth coughing up $20 for an Echo. ...So far I'm kind of disappointed, and it's mainly how limited it is to play specific music titles (aka 'Alexa, play Song X').   Needing to pay $9.95/mo for Amazon Music Unlimited, or a 3rd party dev $3/mo just for Alexa to play the audio of linked YouTube videos. I mean, I'm not going to say it's not worth it.   But the biggest problem I've seen is trying to link my Pandora account to the app. Everytime I press the button on my phone and say ""Alexa, play Pandora"", she says ""Pandora is not supported on this device."" No reason as to why (as it literally gave me the option to link my account), as I've read the app can do pretty much the same things as having an actual Amazon Echo (minus having to pay for one).     I tried asking Pandora for support. They tried what they could, but I tried my own thing.. and discovered I may've been right all this time (that you have to have an Echo just for Pandora to work on it); it will not work with just the app.   Basically I unlinked the Pandora app and uninstalled it, and Alexa still says ""Pandora is not supported on this device."" 'Device' meaning the app, not my phone (which can play Pandora without Alexa).   The reason I'm making this post is, if I'm right. It's freakin' obvious at this point, but I guess I need a slap of reality in my face."
"So, a couple days ago I asked Alexa to play the album ""Kerplunk"" by Green Day. There's one song on that album that I don't like so I said: Alexa, I hate this song. She then skipped it. I didn't think too much of it after that. However, today I asked her to play ""Kerplunk"" again and she automatically skipped the song that I said I hated. As much as I don't really like the song the album does feel somewhat incomplete without it, is there a way for me to get her to stop automatically skipping it? It was streaming through Amazon Music if that makes a difference."
"I turned it on a while ago as my little cousins were over and I didn't want to get in trouble with their parents. The only problem is now I can't turn it off. I checked a couple of tutorials and they all say something akin to:  Settings -&gt; Music -&gt; turn it off  But when I go to do that, I don't have to option to. Does anyone have any ideas? It's getting really annoying when I want to play a song but it won't play. If it's any help I have an Echo Dot 2nd gen."
"I plugged in my echo dot and set it up voice recognition. That's it. I never set anything else up. I live in an apartment and have no ring doorbell set up either. Yet Alexa won't stop telling me that there is ""motion detected at the front door."" It just says it randomly about 10 times throughout the day and in the middle of the night.  How can I get this to stop? Or else it's just gonna be a nice paper weight."
"Most of the time, asking Alexa to play a specific song through Spotify works perfectly well. But sometimes, it's nonsensical in how it picks which song you wanted.  For example, ""Alexa, play Don't Stop Me Now""..  Instead of playing the queen song, I get ""Don't Stop Me Now by Piano Tribute Band.""  WHY? Why would it think I wanted a piano tribute band version instead of the obvious Queen song.   Ok, you say, just ask for the Queen version. ""Alexa, play Don't Stop Me Now by Queen""..  Nope. ""Playing Don't Stop Me Now by Killer Queen.""  Once again, it's giving me a tribute band over the obvious song I want.  I've been noticing this more and more lately. ""Alexa, play Cracklin Rosie"" gives me the cover by Shane MacGowan and the Popes instead of Neil Diamond.   Why does it not just pick the most commonly played song in Spotify? What algorithm is it using to come up with these weird decisions?"
Could somebody maybe ask their Alexa “what is the difference between a binary search tree and a list?” Or maybe “what is the difference between a tree and a list in Haskell.” Or even “what is the difference between an applicative and functor in Haskell.”   Thanks I’d really appreciate it.  If Alexa can answer these kinds of questions I’m gonna get one.
"I’ve got three echos spread around the house and use the multi room speaker groups a lot.  Say I start on the Dot, I then add the rest in using ‘Everywhere’ and it works really well. Question is, how do you step back down again?  ‘Alexa, stop playing on downstairs’ stops everywhere not just downstairs, and ‘stop playing on device x’ is clunky as it is one by one and half the time doesn’t work.  Any suggestions how to go from all speakers to just one in a single, clean command?"

Don’t understand why Alexa can’t control things on a local network just cause the internet down. If there is zero memory in the Alexa and it’s 100% online that’s really friggin dumb. Giving the device a minor amount of memory for local devices and commands would go a long long way. Wonder if google home works offline.

"I say ‘Alexa, play (song name here)’ and she says ‘playing (song name here) on spotify’ and then goes quiet and then just resumes playing whatever was playing previously. I tried it with playlists but the same thing happened...  I swear, its only been on for 2 days and is already bugging out :/"
Title says it all..
"Both of my kids have an echo device in their rooms (one has a dot and one has a flex), along with an echo glow.  As of a few days ago I can no longer control his glow through voice commands. Sometimes she responds with “hmmm I can’t do that” and sometimes she goes on about freetime. I have the smart home setting enabled in freetime and I am able to control other devices through his echo flex. It is only his glow that cannot be controlled all of a sudden. I did test and I am able to control his glow from other devices, just not his. My other son, with the same freetime settings, there is no issue. Any suggestions on how to resolve this?"
"Is there a way to listen to your Alex notifications on the app on your smartphone rather than thru the Echo or Dot, etc.? I am not seeing how to do this. TIA."
"So, I would like to install a Skill (actually a few) on my Alexa, but unfortunately, it appears that since I am in the US and they are German Skills, I cannot.  I find it disappointing since, in this case, I can use my Apple Music or my computer to get the radio station I want, but I cannot use my Alexa."
"Since I can’t adjust bass and treble via the Alexa app (when plugged into speakers), I’m looking at speakers with physical  bass/ treble knobs built into them. Will this work to control the bass? My goal is to have these speakers part of a speaker group (into an echo via aux), but to be able to Lower the bass at night .  I have plugged professional studio speakers into my echo and this worked, but I couldn’t lower bass in the app. Has anyone tested this?"
"All of the rest in the house do and the one that is not will play if I go to Spotify on my phone and tell it to play on that one particular device   On the one that is not working I will say Alexa, play ____.  It responds fine, Now Playing ___ on Spotify.  And then silence.  It will still play the news, the radio, answer questions.. just won't play music.  I go to an Alexa in another room and say the same thing and it starts right away"
"I have a music subscription and one Show device.  Suddenly a few days ago, when I ask Alexa on my Show to play a station, album, or music by an artist, all I get is one stinking song then it quits playing.  Anyone know a fix for this?  I'm thinking about canceling my music subscription if it's become this useless.  Thanks!"
We didn’t need the “bing” and yellow notification ring overnight waking us up to let us know about a “freeze warning” tonight.  Oils have waited until morning. Seems like non-critical (“a tornado is coming right now!”) alerts should be silenced overnight as a default imo.
"There is apparently a bug with the notifications. I tested this today (4/21/20). I tell my Echo to play notifications. It says, ""One new notification from Alexa."" The problem is, it hears itself say it's own name then stops playing. If you tell it to play notifications then immediately mute the mic using the hardware mute button, the notification plays."
"Just a reminder unless you want smart home solutions that are totally unreliable, save your money or buy something else. The App is also atrocious."
Just got the LG C9  and soon also getting the Sonos Beam for audio.  Digital Trends ([https://youtu.be/55V-FK8bYGw?t=132](https://youtu.be/55V-FK8bYGw?t=132)) says to make use of the voice command through the Beam I'll need a Fire stick or dongle.   Since the C9 already has Alexa built in do I still need a Fire stick/dongle to pair it with the Sonos Beam?  Note: Tried pairing my Echo dot to my tv  but doesn't work for some reason...
"Alexa seems to have an extremely high preference for music with lyrics.     Even requested focus, quiet, study, calm, relaxing, cafe, jazz music it always tries to force stuff with lyrics. Most of the time when people play jazz or study music, they don't want lyrics and therefore I never use Alexa's radio feature unless it's classical.     Even when I play an instrumental artist's Mix, it just start skipping to similar songs with lyrics.     Then it'll be inconsistent and go from a quiet classical song to a noisy crooner jazz ballad when i say play study/cafe music.    Is there a better way to tell alexa to play relaxing, cafe, or study music without lyrics?  Saying ""without lyrics"" or ""instrumentals""  in my commands does nothing."
"I made a playlist that shuffles daily using a set up made by Mike Rogers (first time I included the link here it locked up my browser). It creates a playlist call My Morning Shuffle in my Spotify, and it shuffles your playlist every 24 hours. Wonderful.  I cannot get my 1st Gen Echo to play it as an alarm or scheduled routine, it goes to the default sound. I cannot play the routine through my 1st Gen Echo Show as well.   It will work fine with my 2nd Gen Echo Dot.   I've unplugged, going to try a factory reset, but is this just a 1st Gen issue?   &amp;#x200B;  Thank you for any guidance, be well."
"New newsletter from Alexa last Friday. Like usual, here's are the highlights. If you want more, check out the rest of the details in the [full article](https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-17th/).  # Takeaways  Alexa Skills, cooking and information are the main themes from Amazon. Like last week, we only have one command for the pandemic. Even still, it’s only mildly related as it’s household cleaning tips.  One of the promoted skills, Find My Phone, definitely has shady practices going on, like immediately sending newsletters to Alexa users who try the skill, charging users without any upfront warning, and using an unusual signoff of “see ya.” For more info, check out the [Alexa Skills section](https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-17th/#Alexa_Skills).  On the flip side to this disaster of a command, Amazon shows off some of its intelligence with its note system. My favorite command this week being, “Alexa, make a note.…” For more info as to why, check out the [Productivity section](https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-17th/#Productivity).  Another great command from this week promotes free Harry Potter. Until May 1st, you can get *Harry Potter* book one read to you for free from Audible.

"I have multiple groups set up for each room of my house with a smart device.  I have living room group set up with light named living room. And a bedroom group set up with a light named bedroom.  Alexa used to turn the light on and off depending on which room I was in, if I said ""light off"".  Now it asks every time ""did you mean living room?' anytime I say ""light on"" or ""light off"".  How do I make Alexa know that I always mean the light in the same group as her again???"
"I'm trying to make routine that will activate for anyone who speaks to my alexa. Any help?   My voice profile is not the main one, if that has anything to do with it."
"Listen, I like them just fine... but  I must have made the mistake of saying ""Alexa, I like this song."" on a couple of theirs because EVERY (ok almost every) time I say ""Alexa, play some music"" she *immediately* goes in for 21 Pilots. It's gotten to the point that the moment I hear 21 I yell ""Alexa STOP!"" She's going to ruin them for me forever.  Hahaha, granted it's kind of funny but seriously, **how do I find the list of songs I've liked**? Does this not exist? Do I just need to lie to her and start saying I don't like their songs? That's not great either.  It could be worse. Whenever my friends come over they like to mess with me and say ""Alexa, play trance music!"" (Sorry to anyone who loves trance music, I'm rarely in the mood for it, lol.)"
"In each room, I have a specific group created, a group-preferred Echo, and a smart outlet with a light attached (eg: bedroom light; kitchen light). I thought this configuration would allow me to just say 'turn on lights' and only the light for the room would turn on. Instead, alexa complains that it has found multiple devices with the name 'light' and needs me to clarify.  How can I use generic commands that are room-specific?"
"So we have hue Bluetooth bulbs set up in several and they worked fine for a couple of months then suddenly the one in my son's room vanished. The voice control didn't recognise it and it no longer showed up in Alexa app so could only use it as a regular light. Tried discovering devices but it found nothing.  After much googling I tried resetting the bulb several times and still nothing.  Today I tried the Philips hue app and it found the bulb so I made it discoverable and Alexa found it ok.  Now, I can control the light in Alexa app but when I try to control it by voice she says ""A few things share the name Adams light"" and I can't get anywhere.  How do I remove that original device that echo lost because it is clearly in its memory somewhere but it is not listed twice in the app.  I think this home control stuff is a complete pain in the arse and if it wasn't for the rest of the family being against me I would throw the lit out with the amount of trouble I've had with them."
"So I got a dimmer switch for some lights and they used the Smart Life app to connect to my phone.  I was in there last night and added the Smart Life skill to Alexa.  Now, ALL of my Alexa smart home devices don't show up when I go to create a new Routine.  Under Smart Home - there's only the Smart Life device.  Everything else I had setup is just unavailable when creating a new routine.    I tried to disable Smart Life Routine and see if that would bring everything back, but it didn't.    Anyone experience this issue when adding the Smart Life skill to Alexa?"
"I'm trying to connect alexa to the Bluetooth speakers in my hot tub. The speakers are powered by the in.stream 2 system. It shows up in Bluetooth devices. But, every time I choose it alexa will say ""your device wasn't paired"". I've tried with a 2nd gen and 3rd gen dot. What gives?"
"It is unfathomable to me how Alexa doesn’t allow rearranging its lists or items half a decade after its launch. The lists feature is probably 3/4th of what makes Alexa useful for a lot of people and rearranging is the most basic of functionalities. Since it doesn’t seem like they will ever add that feature, what alternatives do people use for list management? Ideally not something that’s async, i.e., when I ask Alexa to add/remove something the list should be updated real time instead of going through some daily sync muckery."
Is there anyway to link my music that I’ve bought on iTunes to Alexa?
"I know this question has been asked before, but what is the go to solution when Spotify Connect starts acting up?  I'm getting delays of 30+ seconds when I change songs and just general laggy behavior and non responsiveness.  Is there a way to reset or re-sync the service?"
"So I got an Alexa dot with a number of smart devices. Voice recognition is pretty awesome, and basic control works, yet somehow it seems really really limitedin what I can do with it. For example, I have a number of lights, and I added them in groups. So I have the group bathroom, and in there a light. If I say ""computer turn off bathroom light"" it perfectly recognized that I asked ""turn off bathroom light"" yet it asks me ""did you mean bathroom?""... Well, doh! Another thing is with the routines.. I can tell it to do certain things, but it rams them out one after the other. Okay, so I want to wait one second. I can't, the minimum wait is 5 seconds. Why not one? And if I want the same routine activated by maybe different voice commands ""turn on TV"", ""turn on the television"", etc. I can't, I have to make the same routing over and over. Can't I just call one routine from another? or repeat a number of steps in a routine? I can set an alarm at 8, but apparently I cannot tell it to turn on the air conditioner at 8?   &amp;#x200B;  Its like all the ingredients are there, but there are either artificial barriers in place to limit what I can do, or I am seriously not seeing something. I'm a developer, and from my point of view, I could do a thousand things with this but somehow I can't.   What am I missing here?"
"Hi All,  &amp;#x200B;  My Daughter has an account in our amazon household on the amazon website, she has a kindle Fire and we pay for fire unlimited.  We have multiple alexa devices around the house, and she has one in her bedroom. At the moment she needs to use either mine or my Wife's account on the Alexa. I am trying to add her account, which is already in the amazon household like me and my wife, to the Alexa Household.  &amp;#x200B;  How do i do this as i can find no instructions on how to do it at all.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks"
I have an echo dot that’s stuck on mute. I didn’t press the button to mute it in the first place I just came to my desk this morning and noticed my Alexa was muted. I tried pressing the mic button to unmute it but it didn’t work. I tried just unplugging it and plugging it back in but it didn’t work. I’ve tried to use the app to unmute it but that didn’t work either.  Has anyone ever had a similar problem and if so how did you fix it?  Any suggestions are appreciated
"I'll be in my car and ask echo auto to play Spotify. ""Getting that from fire TV"". Wtf?! The TV is off in my empty apartment and I'm speaking to echo auto in my car. Why does it throw Spotify to the fire TV when not asked to do so? And it's always the fire TV - never my echo dot.   It started a few weeks ago and doesn't happen all the time, but a majority of the time. I haven't been able to figure out if there's a rhyme or reason. The other day I asked my echo dot to play Spotify and it did the same thing ""getting that from fire TV"". The TV was off &amp; I wanted Spotify from my echo dot, not the TV.   Anyone know what the deal is?"
"Hey, I got my Amazon echo 3 years ago when they were hot and new. My favorite feature has been having Alexa read me the news, which had always be delivered through Routers tv.  I've noticed a lot of changes to the device in the last year. I pay for Amazon music, so I don't get ads there, but now everytime I ask for the news from Reuters, I have to sit through a fucking rediclously long ad before and after the news that combined is about as long as the news itself.  I never had to listen to an ad to hear the news before.  My roommate got an echo Show for our kitchen. I can ask for the news down there and get a full story from Reuters, usually a longer and different story than my echo? With absolutely no ads.  What the fuck?  Thanks"
I will ask Alexa for an update and it always starts with CrossFit.   I have not interest in cross fit and I can’t get it to stop.
Alexa morning routine how do I make it play YouTube on my fire stick   I have my fire stick TV set up   I’m trying to set it up on routine that   8:00am it: -turns in TV -plays a video (cool travel video to inspire me)  Bonus: Can I choose the video or playlist ?

"For example, when I ask Alexa for the weather and it asks a question like ""Do you want to hear the weather for the weekend?""  Is this in the same category as Alexa greetings? I'd like to turn it off without having to turn on brief mode...  EDIT: I guess my point is I’d like to step back to before these add-on questions got inserted into Alexa’s responses"
"I have been trying for days to get this to work and I can't figure out what's wrong. I have read other posts about it, and nothing seems to fix my issues.  I am trying to get an Alexa routine to play Spotify music. No matter what I do, nothing ever plays. I have unlinked and relinked the skill. I have tried every possible combination of phrasing. I have made sure that everything is accurately case sensitive for playlists.. but no matter what I do, she never does anything.  for example, I set a routine to play a playlist called slow jazz.  I go to routine, entered a command ""Alexa, play Jazz"". Then add an action that says Play ""slow jazz"" on Spotify, or play ""playlist slow jazz"" on Spotify, or play ""slow jazz playlist"" on Spotify... etc.  When I attempt to get her to do it, noting happens. she doesn't do anything. I have tried the voice commands, as well as hitting the play button directly in the app on my phone. neither works.  I can directly ask Alexa to play slow jazz on Spotify, and that works, but as soon as I put that into a routine, it doesn't work.  can anyone please help me understand what's wrong?"
"Trying to access my music, amazon music, etc. through the browser UI. When I click on any of the music options I get this error message (on screen):  ""**Alexa app update required**  To browse Amazon Music, you must download the latest version of the Alexa app.  Alternatively, just say, “Alexa, play Amazon Music,” or ask for a specific song."""

"I'm assuming I can't make an Alexa device tell my Fire Cube what to do from another room?  I've yet to get anything to work from my own testing as well.  I hope I'm wrong, but if not... The poor little Fire Cube is officially the step child of all Alexa's decides ha."
"I’ve had routines for over a year that play Spotify playlists as the last step. They all have sudden broken. No error messages, just no music playing. Appreciate any suggestions!  What I’ve tried:  (1)Unlinking and readding my Spotify account with Alexa. (2)Logging out and back into my Spotify app ( I don’t think Spotify is my issue though because that app is working fine ) (3.)Unplugging my Echo. (4.)Changing the wording of my music command from “shuffle X playlist “, to simply “the Beatles”. Still nothing.  Edit: to clarify , all of the steps execute up to the last one , playing Spotify"
"It used to be that when I told Alexa to ""stop"", it just stopped playing music.  Now, when I tell it to ""stop"", it says ""goodbye.""  Is there a way to stop it from saying ""goodbye?"""
"Anyone else having this issue? I haven't changed a thing in any of the settings. It's been sitting in my dining room for months working the way it should. Now all of a sudden it turns the screen off when no one is near it. Once someone walks by it, it turns the screen on again. It's a cool feature, but I don't want it doing that.  I know it automatically got updated a while ago (.6 to .7) but I have no idea what it did. Help!?!?"
"Issue regarding Govee smart led strip  Hi,  Not sure if this is the right place but hopefully someone can help. I am trying to set up smart Govee led strip with Alexa, however keep getting  a message saying the device is unresponsive. I have 2 Alexa and hue light. I’m on sky(uk) network and not sure if that’s causing the issue. The lights work fine via WiFi on the native Govee app.   I have tried the below; 1. Reinstalled all apps  2. Reset both Alexa devices  3. Completely turned off 5ghz wifi 4. Changed 2.4ghz channel to 11 instead of auto  5. Switched Broadband shield off  6. Changed security option from WPA2 to WPA 7. Disabled iPv6 on lan side   The only thing that i can see is to disable IPV6 firewall and some other rules under firewall, however I’m not a tech savvy so not sure if that’s a good idea or whether it will make any difference.   Any help would be much appreciated."
"I have an Echo Spot on my bedside table. When I want to see the time, the clock is gone and there’s a message on the screen suggesting that I ask why is grass green. It’s unbelievable! I literally cannot comprehend why some fuckwit is making these decisions at Amazon.   I feel like taking a hammer and smashing the thing to pieces it’s that annoying.  For about 6 months now, I’ve been waiting for them to see sense and stop this utter madness, but no, they seen fully intent on snatching defeat from the jaws of victory with this mind-bending stupidity. Fuck Echo and fuck you Amazon. I’ll eat the loss and buy a Google home."
"So, me and my girlfriend want to both have a dot. I already have one set up to my smart lights, and she has her account linked up to mine so that she can use her app to drop in, send messages and announcements and mess with my lighting when she wants. Now she wants to get one as well. Will she be able to add the device normally now that her account is linked to mine? And will her dot show up for me so that I can drop in as well?"
"To those of you using an Alexa device in the same room with a home theater, how are false activations?  Any tricks for reducing them?  Did it happen so often you quit or is it pretty good?  Can Alexa hear you over a loud movie for things like volume or pausing?"
Up until October last year I had the  hive skill for lights and smart plugs and the tado skill for heating. One day I had to delete the tado skill because every time I said ‘Alexa turn on/off bedroom light. It would turn the tado radiator thermostat on or off. Was never an problem before and is still happening to this day as I tried to reinstate the skill to see if it had been fixed. Has anyone else experienced this or know of a fix?
"My echo dots are not playing music anymore.  Only plays if I go to Spotify app, put on a song there, and change the device that it should play from, from my cellphone to the stereo pair. It's been like this for over 5 days.  I have already taken it out of the socket many times, unlimited my Spotify account, disabled the Spotify skill...  Anyone?"
"I say, “Alexa turn off the TV” and she says “a few things share the name V, which did you want”   I have NO things named V. I have listened to several recordings of myself and I clearly pronounce T.V.  I did it slowly to make sure. Alexa is only hearing V but why? It also does it to my wife and child when they try.  Edit. When I ask Alexa to turn on the TV. It never does it. It’s only when asking to turn it off."
"Today I forgot all my smart home skill devices in an effort to add a new one (and clean things up a little) and now Alexa cannot discover ANY devices on any of the 4 skills that I use: Harmony, Home Assistant, LIFX and Sonos. I've tried disabling, re-enabling and re-linking to no avail.  Does anyone have any idea what might be going on?  I'm in Australia for what it's worth."
"Hi, just got this alongside the ring doorbell and I wondered if it was possible to stop the live view after so many minutes Currently if someone rings the doorbell it shows a live view on my echo show, but if I don’t tell Alexa to stop, the view will continue to stay on forever (this also means the doorbell has a blue light on constantly)  Am I missing a setting anywhere?"
Hi- so I have my devices to work in both in English and Spanish and while it works great I would like to setup specific routines to be triggered by voice (I want to ask something and get a specific phrase read to me by Alexa) but the problem I have is:  My phone is in English so the Alexa app is of course in English so the issue I end up having is Alexa trying to read my pre-established spanish phrase with her English voice! While hilarious that clearly is not what I'm looking for. Any tips?
"I recently got an Alexa Show and I can't find how to connect it to the app. I have an Alexa dot already, and I can see almost every other type of Alexa on the app to connect, but I do not see the Show on there.

"I have an Alexa skill that doesn't support routines - the Razer skill, which syncs to the lighting on my keyboard &amp; mouse. Is there anything I can use where I have Alexa, as part of a routine, run a command from a skill as if I had said a voice command? For example, if I had a routine which said ""set my lights to blue,"" it would set my IOT lighting to blue, and then run a simulated voice command saying ""Tell Razer to set my Chroma lighting to Blue"""
"So I recently bought the soundtrack for a musical I really like (you wouldn't know, I only listen to obscure music) but I have a problem with the Alexa playing the right song.

 Hi guys I'm posting this just to say thank you to my Alexa for playing fucking lil Wayne when I'm trying to listen to dark side of the moon by Pink Floyd. Also thanks for playing some shit cardi b song when I'm trying to listen to Pink Floyd as well.
"Hi, my mother who is 75 yrs old, not tech savvy at all. But is very excited to get and use her echo dot, Alexa. My sister is going to help her get everything set up.   I do have one question. Can they use my Amazon log in for her device? So she is able to access all my music? And so we do not have to worry about creating an Amazon account for her. Note*in our home, we have three devices on my account already. Does this matter? As long as she has her own smartphone and downloads her own application for her Alexa?   Is this feasible? Thanks ❤️"

"There has been a persistent referral link spam on /r/alexa. Banning the user isn't working because they keep coming back with a new account everyday.   So, the following changes are being made -   1. A minimum of 10 karma will be needed to create a post. 2. Twitter will be banned temporarily. How temporary is TBD.  I don't think the minimum karma requirement is going to hurt any real users of this subreddit."
"I asked about her skills and she kept suggesting Arabian radio stations and islamic related skills. Although I live in UK and I never asked her anything about religion or Arabian oriented stuff at all!

"So I brought a broadlink so I could control my tv via voice commands through my Echo Dot.  It turns on and off, controls the volume and change channels very well. But I can't control the inputs, I wanted to change HDMI 1 to HDMI 2 for example. But all Alexa say is that my tv is not compatible.  I use the smart life app in my phone, it has some buttons that were supposed to change automatically between the outputs, like there is a button for ""tv, av, HDMI"" but they don't do nothing (my tv don't do anything)  It only changes the inputs when I press the ""output"" button and manually select the HDMI that I want.  Has someone seen a similar problem? I don't know if I am doing something wrong or if my tv is just not compatible with these functions."
I'm at an rv park where we use wifi. In order to login with my xbox or laptop I have to authenticate through the browser. Is there a way to bypass that on Alexa so itll connect to the internet? I just bought 2 dots today and if I cant get them to work I have to return them.
"I am not sure if this has been posted yet, but has anyone been having problems when setting location reminders? One of the few things I use my echo frames for is to set reminders for when I get to work and home. I ask Alexa to remind me to pay something when I get home for example and she says ""okay Ivan to set up this reminder open the alexa app for reminders and alarms."" Is there a way to fix this? Regular time reminders work just fine."
"My Alexa is acting super weird lately. Randomly at night, she starts playing super creepy music. Heavy, low, dark horror movie piano sounds, and that turns into a weird hip-hop funky song, but still with that creepy piano. A song I never played before. I checked it’s log, no command was given to it. There was no bluetooth connection, no Spotify or Amazon Music activity, simply nothing. Alexa got no command to to anything. And what creeps me out the most: I was sitting there for about 10 minutes in my living room, petting my cats, I made no noise. 5 minutes before, it played the song I asked for, and all of a sudden, it plays this creepy song again. Again, no clue in the log. She has not misheard a command, and she has not made any sign of connecting/disconnecting, she was not operated by a different device. Only I got access to my Amazon and my Wi-Fi.   Can anyone help me with this bug? I consider selling my Echo Dot, this is robbing my sleep lately..."
"Hi, my mom has an Skype account and an Alexa Show. Skype is activated on her Alexa. Now, She has a new cell phone, and she does not want to install Alexa on her cell phone. I am able to help her with Skype on her PC to add contacts (example, ""Bob""), but if I then ask Alexa to Skype call ""Bob"", it does not recognize that new contact.  Is there any way to add a NEW skype contact on her Alexa Show without involving her cell phone to link contacts? ... she does have Skype and Alexa on her Windows laptop, but it just seems that, regardless, you have to use a cell phone that has skype and alexa ... (That is, there does not seem to be a way to link new skype contacts to Alexa, when using PC apps). Also...When I access her Alexa account online, it seems the only contacts you can add manually are phone numbers (not skype contacts)... Is there any way around this?"
"As the title suggests, I wanted to explain my setup.  2 rooms and 1 living room making it 3 universal remotes and 3 echo dots.  Long story short I have the 3 universal remotes and I am only able to access alexa from room 1. I want to do everything whichever room I am in so I am buying another Amazon Echo dot 3 for the living room and room 2. Is it possible to clone my first echo dot to a 2nd and 3rd so I wouldn't have to program everything again?"
"The newest ""feature"" is playing a loud alert every time there's a weather warning. Even at 3 am.  I live in ohio, so we get freeze and tornado warnings multiple times over the course of the night this time of year.  Tried disabling it in the app, it did NOTHING.  Fuck off, alexa, I am trying to sleep.  EDIT: Yes, I set it to Do not Disturb. The alerts supercede Do Not Disturb."
I hate when it puts the image stretched behind the photo itself. On Google Home it shows two photos side by side instead. I'd even be fine with a single coloured background. Echo Show 8.
"This is pretty shitty.  I have ""my flash briefing"" configured to play BBC news.  Lately after it finishes playing, Alexa says ""here's news from other providers"" and starts playing some raucous Fox News broadcast.  I tell Alexa to stop.  ""Alexa, Stop playback""  ""Alexa, stop"" ""Alexa, stop news""  It just keeps playing.  I have to pull the power to get Alexa to stop playing fox news.  I feel like my home has been invaded.  I'm ready run a drill through all my alexa units and send them to the electronics recyclers."
"We've tried all the standard stuff -- power cycling the Echo, disconnecting and reconnecting spotify account, etc.  If we say, ""play the spotify playlist X"" -- it works perfectly.  If we say, ""good morning"" (a routine that includes spotify playlist X) -- it just goes silent.  This worked well just a few days ago, but we did switch internet and installed a new router.  I just don't get why it would affect just the routines?"
Hi  I was wondering if it possible to make Alexa play a certain sound clip when asked a specific command  Maybe through IFTTT?
"Anyone else having issues with Spotify recognizing echo dot devices?  Spent 2.5 hours on the phone with Spotify yesterday only to be told to check with the manufacturer and of course Amazon isn't taking support requests.  I get a ""can't play this right now"" error on all my devices in spotify and alexa takes the command but never actually plays anything.  Thoughts?  Tips??"
"Hi im so sorry but this is my first time using alexa, i just bought echo dot and broadlink rm mini,in ihc apps everything works fine i can control my ac,fan,tv but the problem is alexa cant find my rm mini, after i add broadlink remote function in alexa apps it always shown there isnt device around,does anybody have answer for this?"
I have 2 nest thermostats and 2 z-wave thermostats (through Home Assistant) added to Alexa. I control the Nests through the scheduling feature of that app. Is there a good way to schedule the z-wave thermostats through Alexa? I’d like to schedule temp changes based on when people are home and what rooms are being used.
I've been using my echo show to drop in on my folks for a couple of years now. Quality has been steadily getting worse. Calls will freeze or drop out completely every call. We both have over 100mbps Comcast. I upgraded to new echo show 8s and still no better. We both have high end WiFi routers. Am I the only one with these awful quality problems?
"I just set up my first Echo Dot and I’m trying to create a routine using Spotify but I can’t get the music to actually play. I’m able to play Spotify outside of a routine (account is linked and it’s set as my default).  If I check my recent plays after it runs the routine the song that was supposed to come on does show as being played.  If I change the routine to use amazon music, everything works as planned. Anyone experience this and know how to fix it?"
"I can't really think of a time when I would want to hear her voice.  I don't ask her for the weather.  I just want a positive chime when I make a timer.   The most annoying thing is when I ask for a song and it isn't available and she goes into her long-winded market spiel about Amazon super-prime (or whatever).  Any way to turn off this notification?   apologies for the rant, but there's only so much I can take"
"If I select Amazon Music, Play On: Everywhere , Success! But if it's Spotify , it doesnt. Closest I get is sometimes when I try to select it, I get a loud thud. Another weird thing I noticed is that if I select Spotify one one Echo, it will say the artist is playing on that echo, but something different is playing everywhere."
"Hello all, I just bought my new Bose revolve with Alexa. I installed the app and did basic configuration. I could play songs in Bluetooth. Problem I'm facing is - when I voice command Alexa to play song it asks me to enable skill in the app. I did it in my app choosing Bose as the device. Still not working on voice command. I already have an Echo plus Alexa at home. I'm not sure if that device is interfering with the current device's configuration. Can someone help me out?"
I have a alexa enabled bose speaker but i am only able to play songs throught Bluetooth...if i tell Alexa to play it tells i have to enable some skill in Alexa app...i have typed bose and enabled the skill but still the bose tells me to enable the skill and i aldready have one echo plus at home is it possible that it takes preference of the first alexa and not the alexa enabled bose speaker....can someone help me out!!
"Recently we put a dot in my eight year old daughter's room partly because she loves the NPR kids' show ""Wow in the World.""  I've been trying to find other kids podcast that are current events/news oriented for her and found a few that I then loaded into the Stitcher app as favorites.  It's horrible.  Half the time when you ask Alexa to play a specific show she says ""Playing (insert name of show here)"" and then just goes dark/silent.  Once it turned out to be a weird delay because after requesting the show three or four times it started right on cue, and then about 3 seconds later, the same show started again so that both shows were playing simultaneously 30 seconds off...  There is also a podcast  called ""KidNuz"" which is a daily 5 minute ""flash briefing"" of stories and headlines curated specifically for kids, but its nearly impossible to get Alexa to play it because she sees it just as it's spelled (KID-NUZZ instead of Kid News).  When I did get her to play it via Stitcher, even though I had it set up in the favorites list to play newest episodes first, she played episodes from January.  Here are the shows I'd like for my daughter to be able to call up the most recent episodes of whenever she wants:  &amp;#x200B;  * KidNuz * Wow in the World * Eleanor Amplified * Warrior Kids  Does anyone have a good solution for this?  I'm ready to throw the damn thing out the window."
"Seems like Alexa’s functionality, across the board, has gone seriously downhill in the past few months. She misunderstands almost everything, doesn’t remember things, is harder to awaken, cuts out, etc etc etc etc.  It has tipped into being more frustrating than useful.  Anyone else been experiencing this? Maybe it’s because so many people are home now? Either way all my other electronics seem ok."
"Hey,   I have set up my alarm with spotify and use the voice commands to set the alarm noise to a song or playlist. In the alarms section it says the song but then when the alarm goes of it just makes the standard noise. How do I fix this!"
"I purchased the polk command bar with Alexa. I run on a smarthings/alexa based home. I'm having issues with the Alexa on the polk bar (which is connected as my primary fire TV and TV Speaker) doing the commands such as showing my camera, and turning on the TV. I also grouped it with a speaker group with all my alexa's and when I play music on the ""everywhere"" group it doesn't seem to kick on. Anyone have any ideas or suggestions?"
"I'm trying to set up a custom routine for Alexa to automatically turn all the lights in my house on if my ring alarm system starts to siren. I have set up similar commands using the app simple commands but can't wrap my head around this one. Hardware available is my ring alarm system, multiple echo's, and smart things"
"For the past few days, Alexa has started playing music  at random times. Last night, she started at 2am.  First thought was that I was being pranked by neighbors (Corona cabin fever is rampant), but there's nothing in activity and no unexpected devices.  Possibly related: the music might be from the classical radio we were playing last week.  Suggestions how to diagnose what's going on?"
"Alex play ""thy art is murder""  &amp;#x200B;  them plays some bobbins remix .   &amp;#x200B;  why does it take forever to recognize the bands i wanna listen to.   Feel like an edjit shouting CATTLE DECAPITATION to some tube in my house"
"Hi,  I can setup Alexa to turn off all the lights etc. when my phone gets far from the house.  Or, when my wife’s phone gets far.... I cannot figure out a way to do it when we are BOTH gone.    In other words if I am gone, and she leaves, I’d like it to turn off all the lights.  But if I am home and she leaves, I don’t want it to.  Has anyone found this possible to do?"
The Alexa app on my phone keeps crashing. It asks me to log in and then stops and crashes. I saw other people having the same problem. Does anyone know when Amazon will fix this?  EDIT: It's back up now!
"To turn a plug on for X minutes, I need:  \- turn on plug  \- wait X minutes  \- turn off plug  But the problem is, the Alexa app requires that the step to play music be last, so it doesn't start until the plug is turned off.  Anyone figure out a way to do these both in the same routine?"
Anyone else with alexa app not working rightnow?   Edit: Fixed now.
"I have an IPhone XR and the latest update logged into my Alexa app and was told there was an error, went to log in type my credentials in it goes back to the main log in screen typed the wrong password to see what it did it says wrong password so I know that isn’t the problem uninstalled and reinstalled twice as well as restarted the phone, as well as tried it on my iPad with the same deal. My WiFi information has changed since my last log in same WiFi console and password just a different WiFi name. I don’t know what to do and I’m going crazy because I have routines I set on there when I was working but currently am off with corona virus and every day at 5:15 my lights come on and she tells me the weather can’t get into the app to change this. Someone please help!"
"Hey guys. Time for another Alexa Newsletter review. Link to the post is at the bottom for more detail.  ## Takeaways  Here’s how the new commands break down for this week’s newsletter:  * Donations: 1 * Timers: 1 * Information: 2 * Alexa Skills: 4 * Smart Home: 2 * Jokes: 3 * Music: 3 * Alarms: 1 * Audible: 2 * Productivity: 2  Music, Audible and ambient sounds are the main themes this week. We have only one updated command for the pandemic, so we’re now seeing a slowdown in updates there.  ### Music and Ambient Sounds  Music and ambient sounds had a big showing this week. Amazon really wants users to know about Alexa’s Ambient Sound abilities. And with added commands for changing the equalizer, we’re seeing more emphasis on music quality.  ### Audible  Audible seems to get at least one command each newsletter so far, with this week being no exception. One of the commands is very much a bust, while the other could be useful with your kids at home.  Amazon tends to push Audible too hard on Alexa users. WIth one command, it feels like Amazon is using the notion of “free” as an opportunity to upsell.  ### Alexa’s Xbox Integration  Alexa has very solid integration with Xbox. This isn’t too surprising these days. Microsoft has stopped using [Cortana to compete with Alexa ](https://www.cnet.com/news/cortana-reborn-microsofts-digital-assistant-becomes-less-alexa-more-productivity-app/)which benefits Alexa users in this case.  ### Productivity Weaknesses  Amazon has a built-in to-do list with Alexa that doesn’t seem to integrate with any other known productivity systems out there. Although it does work, I find it pretty lacking. Just having a to-do list in Alexa isn’t compelling enough for the average user to switch from a system they already use, like the iOS Reminders App. Amazon needs to step up their game in this space.  ### Donation Awareness  There are many organizations that accept donations that don’t actually use the money for what they say. This week’s donation command is a solid example. Although it says Coronavirus Relief, we don’t actually know where that money is going, or what it’s doing. Amazon doesn’t provide that information. Your dollars may not go to the right people to make an impact.  ## Next Newsletter  That’s all for this week! Let’s see if we get another newsletter before the end of April. I’m thinking a monthly roundup of all the newsletters for the month might be useful, especially if we continue to get a weekly update from Amazon. Let me know if that’s something you would be interested in reading in the comments below.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-10th/](https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-10th/)"
"I just set up a speaker group with Google Home speakers and then a Chromecast to my TV soundbar, but there is a 200ms delay on the soundbar when casting music to the group. Google has an option to add delay but apparently you can only add delay to Chromecast, not Google Home speakers (exact opposite of what I need).  Thinking about switching to Alexa, is this possible?"
Does one exist? I'm looking for a display for my computer status and the Echo Show 8 looks like it's the perfect size.
"So I have one Amazon account, setup with my student discount. I setup my parents home with smart lights and Echos and such. I recently bought a new place of my own and I’m looking to give myself the same setup with smart lights and Alexa devices. Is there a way to setup a second home in the IOS Alexa app? Seems impossible to create a second home location and I don’t want to mesh the echo devices between two separate homes. Any advice or solutions?"
I have severe weather alerts enabled on my Alexas. Does anyone know if there is a way to set this to auto-announce?
Hey gang. I want to use Alexa as a speaker to play lullabies for the baby all night but the music usually stops after an hour when I ask Alexa to play.   How do I have my echo dot not stop until asked?
"Started seeing this a while back but not sure what the full extent of the functionality is. Used to be that a timer was tied to a single device. Now, seems I can ask any Echo about any of the running timers.  Wondering what this is called so I can look into it more.  In our kitchen area, we have an Alexa but occasionally, when setting a timer, another Ecoh will hear the request.  It's a good thing but want to make sure that I'm not missing anything it can do."
"Curious for some guidance here. I would really like to listen to more songs similar to Miles Davis’ Blue in Green. I’ve asked Alexa to play similar music, and she begins playing “my Station” from Apple Music."
"I am living in asia and ive been a google home user. everything works fine. tried out buying an echo dot and ive noticed that it sometimes takes too long to respond like controlling smart switches. google assistant would control the switches instantly while the echo takes around 6-12 seconds before it control the switches. it is just so frustrating. also sometimes songs on spotify are choppy and lagging even if i have a fast internet. my question is, does this issue have something to do with alexa app/echo dot not officially available in my country ( i just installed an apk) like the servers are in the usa thats why it is taking so long to respond?. sorry for my bad english let me know if you have questions"
"I have 3 Alexas. I have succeeded in syncing my ""main"" Alexa to play audio from PC. However, my other two Alexas don't play, and I want all three of them to play audio from my computer at the same time. I have a ""home group"" with all three of them that will play at the same time, but I have to use my voice to activate it.   How do I get my home group to play from my computer at the same time? Thanks."
"So, I’m obsessed with creating routines to help me do stuff throughout the day and to help me stay productive.  However, I’m struggling to figure out how to get Alexa to read off my to-do list using a scheduled routine. I’m able to ask her to read my to-do list and she does it just fine. But there doesn’t seem to be any way to do this under a routine.  Am I missing something? Seems like something that should be a no-brainer for a possible routine."
"When I chose my echo as a decisive on Spotify using the iOS app, I used to be able to control the echo volume from my phone.   Lately that’s not the case, probably 80% of the time. But randomly it sometimes still does it.   Any rhyme or reason to this? Anything I can do to still control the volume?"
"I've tried asking Alexa many different ways, but seems not to work. (Although I think I did it successfully once a couple months ago.)"
"I absolutely cannot get my Echo 2nd gen Dot separate from my 3rd gen. I don't want any of the 3rd gen's reminders or alarms on the 2nd gen.  I have been through the official directions over and over. 2nd gen just would not deregister. After much trying, I finally was able to create separate accounts, but everything remained the same on both devices.  I did yet another factory reset which I thought would finally work... until 2nd gen told me that reminders and alarms weren't supported.  What could I be missing?"
"Experts, I need your help here. I cannot for the life of me figure this one out. I just bought the Ecolink Sensor, paired it with SmartThings hub and discovered the device though my Echo Plus. All is good... the device properly registers, I can see its status change on both the SmartThings hub and under Alexa Devices changing status as I tilt it. So all is good there... I am trying to create a routine when the sensor is tilted, for Alexa announces the Garage Door is open.... ""When"" in Alexa is set to Open, Anytime is default, ""Alexa Will"" Say ""Close Main Docking Bay"" and it does not work.... any recommendations?"
"I have two echo dots in the living room. They were set up as a stereo pair. everything was working fine.  But now music will only play through one speaker regardless of which one I ask to play music. In addition when I ask Alexa to play music it begins playing what I ask for but after about 30 seconds there is a long pause and it begins playing the next song on the playlist. I have it set for Amazon music as the default player.  Yes i has tried unpairing and re-pairing the speakes as a stereo speaker set, I have unplugged both and let them reset. Anyone have an idea what is going on/ and how to fix this problem?"
"I have an Echo 2nd gen in the kitchen and listen to a lot of music while cooking, eating meals, etc. I recently received an Echo Show 5 as part of a bundle and I think it would also work well in the kitchen for the display features, but I don’t want to sacrifice sound quality.   Is it possible to set up both and use the Echo 2nd gen as the primary for music playback but use the Show for everything else?"
"I regularly check my activity to see how she misunderstood me and very often I find it's not there and that a lot of previous commands are missing. Can't see a pattern to it, seems random to me and I'd say at least half of it is not recorded."
"This happens all the time to me. Echo show will show me an interesting news story, I ask alexa to tell me the story. The first sentence basically repeats the title. Some irrelevant details or backstory follow that doesn't tell you more about the actual story. The title is once again repeated in a slightly different way and that's it.  Absolutely no new details about the actual story are given."
"Hi.    Is there a way to force my Echo dot to retry connection to my  WiFi repeater? I have it scheduled to turn off at night, but then when I try to use the Dot in the morning,  it  says there is no connection. I have to manually  reconnect using the Alexa app.    It's  kinda weird that it  does not auto reconnect once the hotspot is available again.."
"At 3:45 this morning, something triggered my outdoor Ring Doorbell motion sensor. I have tlny bedroom echo set to DND at night, but I think I would want an exception to someone creeping on my property. Surely there must be a way to do this without getting shipping alerts in the middle of the night."
"What is the latest version, mine is showing as 6.5.3.6 (NS6536/2502)"
I set a timer for my dinner in the kitchen and would like to be able to check the timer/hear the ringing in a different room
Can I get Alexa to ask me what time I want to wake up in the morning? and then set what time I say as the alarm Clock time?
"REPOST:   I know how to change the sound of ALARMS, but there seems to be no way to change the sound of the countdown timer.    Thus, ""Alexa, wake me up at 6am"" will play my chosen very peaceful alarm sound (orcas, ascending in volume), but ""Alexa, wake me up in 6 hours"" will only play that annoying timer sound.    Anyone figure this out yet?"
"Is there a possible way to plug on an external computer subwoofer to my echo dot 3rd gen?, have the audio play out of alexa and have the external subwoofer punch some extra bass."
"I have a goodnight routine that turns the smart lights off, sets the volume to low, and plays the ""meditation"" station from Amazon Music. The problem I'm having is that the music stops playing at random intervals. Sometimes it plays for hours, sometimes for a few songs.  My routine doesn't specify a duration for the music.  What I'd like is to play the playlist continously/on loop until I wake up and turn it off.  I tried changing the station name in the routine from ""meditation music"" to ""meditation music on loop"" to short circuit it but the routine displayed an error.  What are my options here? If I create different routines to start the playlist multiple times a night, the automated response will wake me up. Should I make a custom playlist that is many hours long and play that instead? Is there a skill I can wrap my Amazon Music call in? Should I use a different music provider?"
"I have looked around for a solution for a while now, and finally I found a working way.  * You have to have a speaker group, any name should be ok. * Put the tracks that you want to play in a playlist. * In the skill write:  1. Play My Playlist \[Playlist Name\] \[Group Name\] 2. Shuffle My Playlist  \[Playlist Name\] \[Group Name\]  * Please have a look at the screen shots * In my case I wrote: **Shuffle My Playlist Relaxing Time Everywhere**  1. Shuffle; to play the tracks in random order, you can substitute **Shuffle** with  **Play**, if you want the tracks to play in order 2. Relaxing Time; is the name of the playlist 3. Everywhere; is the name of the speaker group  I hope this works for you as well.  https://preview.redd.it/gfl0kutj97s41.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e6b8a80e7efa8a660bc212ba03b3da55e4da50c  https://preview.redd.it/v779wetj97s41.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8f6ea821e5e02f96028b312038ed137fd061389  https://preview.redd.it/a06u6itj97s41.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4718c1b919ea49092194ec25f548b021f4508887"
"I have an Alexa auto connected via aux cable to my car.   Lets say I play any music, great.  A person calls me, great.  A person hangs up, music doesn't continue, problem.   The issue is persistent in recent weeks but before, when the call was over, the music will continue.   I've tried to reset the whole thing and nothing works. The only thing that works is to disconnect the device from power, and then re-connect it. It works fine until another call goes through, then my music doesn't continue.  Any tips to fix this??"
Tonight I put on some very relaxing music to fall asleep to. Then I was awoken at around 3am when Alexa dutifully informed me that she had a connection problem.   Thanks Alexa but I really don’t need to be woken up at 3am to know this!
"I would like for Alexa to make an announcement when a guest arrives on all devices... is there a way Alexa can detect when someone joins my WiFi ? Or maybe they are added through the Alexa guest connect feature and Alexa can recognize who they are? I think IF there is a way to do this, it would require a one time setup for each guest - that’s fine, but is there anyway Alexa can recognize when someone is around"
"Hi all, I frequently host gatherings where my friend come over and watch whatever team it is we are focused on that day.. my setup has a stadium type feel to it so I would like to utilize Alexa as much as I can in the “ PA Annoucner “ role. So I’m trying to figure out how I can kick off a routine on my phone when a game ends and announce the final score and then play a song or something to that effect...   I had thought it could work if I had a routine where one step was “ Alexa, what was the falcons score “ and then she answers it aloud but the question itself was asked internally in the routine... or perhaps play a sports update and the only team on the update is the one we are watching that day?   Any ideas/solutions/suggestions?"
Alexa keeps playing clean versions of songs unless I go into the app and choose the explicit version.  WHICH NEGATES THE POINT OF ALEXA.    also it says it can’t find music that clearly exists and is in Spotify. If I can’t fix this I’m destroying this garbage product.    Yes I have that explicit nonsense disables through the app.
"Is it possible to have a routine open a specific app on the Firestick?  Currently, I can make a routine to turn on the TV, but that's as far as I can get.  Thanks in advance!"
"voice command like alexa go up/down/left/right works pretty well. But how to press enter via voice command? I tried all tje following failed  alexa, enter alexa, press enter alexa, confirm"
1. I ONLY want explicit versions of songs. Nothings been more mind boggling than telling her to play March Madness by Future &amp; every couple words are blocked. I tried explicit filter but it’s not doing anything it still sneaks it clean versions when it can.   2. She keeps saying she can’t find any music off 1999 by Joey Bada$$ and that’s pissing me off too. Maybe the symbols in his name? But when she responds say straight up says “BadASS”   Pretty sad rn.
I just bought a 3rd generation Alexa two months ago. Today I asked her “Alexa what’s the weather” knowing it’s snowing out I just wanted the degrees. And her sentence started to skip in response. Like 15 second pauses every two to three words. Any advice?
"Ok, maybe someone can shed some light on this for me.   &amp;#x200B;  I used to use my parent's Amazon Prime account, until I got one of my own. While on my parent's account, I picked up an Amazon Fire Cube, Teckin smart plugs and an Alexa enabled LED strip for the back of my TV. I had no problem hooking them up initially and was able to control each of them using voice commands. After switching to the new Amazon account, none of the commands worked. I removed my Fire TV from their account and registered it with ours and they still didn't work. After messing around with the settings in Alexa, I was able to get the Teckin smart plugs to work(I have lamps plugged into them, so it's pretty handy). However, I cannot for the LIFE OF ME, get the rest of the voice automation to work again. The only commands that are recognized are ""Turn the front lamp on/off"" and ""Turn the rear lamp on/off"".  My settings for ""All on/off"" and ""TV Backlight"" are no longer recognized. I feel like I've tried everything and am just at my wits end, lol. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
This drives me nuts.  I want to play music for my puppy all day yet it always stops after 5-6 minutes.  I use Apple Music.  Thanks

which ones better alexa or google home.
"Echo devices and Alexa are honstely still trash. While they like to advertise the newest and smartest features, it's still working so bad for basic things like telling the time or controlling music playback.  The level of QA they have is frankly embarassing.  At least when the speech recognition works, which is a big if, I expect somewhat reliable execution of the basic features. As it is, it's always a much better bet to grab your phone then try and have Alexa do it.   When I was working today I wanted to switch to the next song on Spotify.   My FireTV cube is linked to my Echo dot, otherwise it's deaf as soon as music plays.   Problem 1: for Spotify, the linked Echo Dot just says ""This device doesn't support that"" whenever it picks up your voice over the FireTV.   Once you manage to have the FireTV pick it up instead, it just said ""what do you want to play?"". The next song, like I said, duh. It just repeats ""what do you want to play"". Goddamnit.   Turns out it doesn't work it you open the Spotify app on the FireTV and presumably via your phone on the FireTV. Playback control only works when Spotify was opened via Alexa too.   And that's the sad state of the most popular music service they heavily advertise. Just imagine how buggy less known or more complex things are.   Instead of trying to implement a bunch of barely working new things, they should spend more time on cross-device functionality and some serious QA on the most important functionality.   I don't understand how people can even recommend or rate this crap highly in it's current state, years after the initial release, when the most basic functionality is still not anywhere as reliable as they would like you to believe.   /rant"
"ALEXA SETUP CANNOT BE COMPLETED RIGHT NOW  Thanks Alexa but you’ve been set up and in the same place for the last 6 months, what’s wrong with you?  Does anyone know if there’s a setting where she’s just in listening mode? No responses, no out of the blue yelling? Just shut up and do what I say."
"After years of watching Alexa get worse and it becoming more of an annoyance and hindrance than  anything else, I've just snapped and bought a Google Nest Hub 7"" and Google Home to go with the Google Nest Mini I already got. These will replace a crappy Show 5, Echo and one of my Dots and I'll be selling everyone of my Alexa devices.  It was fun and at times Alexa was useful but for me it's over. The lack of innovation, constantly reducing quality and just how fucking annoying Alexa is now killed it for me."
"For instance, I say ""Alexa, goodnight"" and as part of the routine, I'm asked what time I want to set my alarm in the morning for."
Does anyone find the new song quiz playlist in poor taste (albeit hilarious)? Here are some of the songs we got:   Temperature- Sean Paul Take My Breath Away- Berlin No Air- Jordan Sparks Fever- Peggy Lee This Is Why I’m Hot- MIMS  Mask Off- Future Sicko Mode- Travis Scott  Notice the theme? 😂😂😂
"I'm not using my studio a Fire TV, but I'd like to use a remote with it.  The Fire TV remote includes different pairing instructions than what I find in the Alexa app for the studio.  No matter which instructions I follow I fail to pair the remote.  I've tried both an older style remote and a brand new remote.  Is this even possible?  If it is, what method did you successfully use to pair the remote?"
"So my wife just got an Amazon Fire tablet that has Alexa. We have spotify premium and frequently hook our phones/tablets up on our stereo.  She was excited to be able to use voice command to control what we listen to.  She's linked her Spotify account and set it as the default music app but it doesn't seem to work with most of the commands you want.   When you ask Alexa to play music or for example ""Alexa play Foo Fighters"", it works fine, opens the app, and plays the song.  But for some reason when you give certain commands it will ignore the command for spotify and instead opens the Amazon music app. So for example if you say ""Alexa play music"", Spotify opens and plays. But then if you say ""Alexa skip song"" it will stop spotify, open the Amazon Music app and play the next song qued in that app.  Similarly if you're playing spotify and you say ""Alexa stop music"" ""Alexa pause music"", it does nothing.  Not sure what the issue is. This is our first time dealing with Alexa so apologies if it's a simple fix.  Any help is appreciated!"
"Hey guys, I got an amazon branded plug the other day and it's not showing up on other alexa apps that have been synced up to the household. Is there an easy fix or will I have to remove and re add them for every new device?"

"Good god... How can this be the same ""alexa"" thats in all my dots and echo's in my home... This thing seems thick as shit, misunderstands me a lot, and sometimes cant even hear me, even tho i,m only 6ft away from it..  It supposed to have 8 superior mics, but with it sitting to side of my tv, as it supposed to do, my other dot in kitchen and bedroom, activate before this dam thing does, sometimes..  If the tv volume is low enough, then yes, it works as should, most of the time... It changes UK sky channels ok, changes inputs ok, turns equipment on/off ok, but the actual alexa side it it seems dumber than the rest of my other dots for some odd reason..  Is it just me here guys ?  Or has anyone else got same probs? Gonna keep it, to see if they add more update over the next yr, as it has potential. It the newer version, 2nd gen i think it called ( 2019 )"

"In order for me to control the volume of an alexa speaker or an alexa multiroom music group on the Spotify iOS app, I have to:  1) begin playing music on my phone (switch it to my phone if it’s already playing on a group/speaker) 2) switch audio to a group/speaker  3) switch audio back to phone 4) switch audio back to group/speaker  then I can control the volume of that alexa speaker or multiroom music group via the iOS Spotify app. I called and asked spotify about it and they said “Oh yes, we have our top agents on it right now” but i’m pretty sure they didn’t really understand the issue.   I’ve tried uninstalling both apps and deleting and recreating the groups and the issue persists.   Any additional troubleshooting ideas?"
"I’m trying to set up a morning routine on my Alexa. When my alarm is dismissed, Alexa says good morning, tells me the time and the weather. I also want her to tell me what is on my to do list.  I can usually trigger this by asking “Alexa, what’s on my to do list?”, but I can’t seem to get her to do this as part of a routine, only when I ask her specifically.  I’ve tried IFTTT, and various to do list apps with their relevant amazon skills, none have worked.  Yes I could just ask her every morning, but the whole point of this is so I can have my robot overload automate and enforce my work ethic. I want to wake up to the time, weather, and a reminder of what I need to do today.  Please help!"

"My devices connected to a Tuya Smart power strip has been working very well with Alexa for a long time. But as of a few days ago, they have stopped working.  I have tried removing all the devices from Alexa, disabling the Tuya skill, re-enabling the Tuya skill and re-discovering the devices.   Alexa is able to detect and add the devices but as soon as the devices as added, Alexa shows them as ""Device is unresponsive"".

"I have an Echo Dot, I purchased an echo show five for an elderly member in the family that is several hours away from me, so that he could FaceTime with his grandchildren. Since he didn’t have a smart phone, I set up a Skype account for him so that the rest of us could communicate with him through Skype, And we also didn’t have to buy echo devices for ourselves. So the echo five show was set up through my Amazon account. And the Skype account I created for him I also linked through my Amazon account. The problem is, Every time someone tries to call him on Skype my Echo Dot rings. Is there anyway for just the echo show to ring for Skype calls but not my Echo Dot?"
"Hi everyone! I've recently bought an Alexa for my elderly Grandmother so we can stay in contact with her during the Covid lockdown. Video calls are great, but what I'd also like to be able to do is send her videos pics &amp; GIFs in the same way that I would using WhatsApp on my phone. Is there a way to do that? Thanks in advance!"
"I’ve recently noticed that, if a routine was set to say something at the end of a series of actions, the echo will complete the actions, wait 15-30 seconds and then say whatever it was supposed to say.  For instance, in my good night routine, Alexa turns off all the lights, then waits 15-30 seconds before saying good night."
I'm not sure why this isn't a standard ability on a voice operated device.
3-Way switch assistance.  Hallway light switch at both ends.  I only replaced one three way switch. With a Alexa 3-way switch.  Did the same in my Kitchen.  The Kitchen works just fine because the second switch is ever used.  The Hallway switch gets turn on at both ends.  So when it's off and my settings 12am turn off all lights it turns it on.    If I got another 3-way switch would my hallway work correctly?
"For some reason, Alexa app disappears from my Lenovo tab after rebooting. It seems not to be properly installed because is not enabled in Google Play just after installing.

Or is there a list somewhere that shows what skills can work with other languages/ any guidance on this matter?"

"I just got a Firestick which is plugged into my 60"" Vizio dumb TV.  I successfully enabled CEC settings so that all I need to do is press the Home button on the Alexa remote to either power up the TV and immediately switch to the Firestick input or just immediately switch to the Firestick input when the TV is already on and I'm watching satellite content, which is a nice feature.  However, what I would really like to do is enable full voice control of the Firestick via an Echo device so that I don't even need the Alexa remote.  I had an Echo Input laying around that I picked up on Prime Day for $15 that I hadn't found a use for yet, so I linked it to the Firestick.  In general it worked as far as being able to call up content with my voice, pause, rewind, etc...but there were two issues:  &amp;#x200B;  * Even with CEC enabled I still could not power the TV on just by saying ""Alexa, turn on Fire TV"" * For some reason with the Input linked to the Firestick, the audio plays through the Input, not the TV speakers.  I supposed this would be OK if I used a full sized Echo or if I patched the Input through a soundbar, etc...  Any ideas?"

"I have three Echo Inputs all hooked to old stereos but none of them think they are since they all say ""Need Attention"".  They work alright but I can't drop in or call out on them because the Echo's don't think they are hooked to a speaker.  I'm guessing newer speakers are smart somehow and can tell the Echo they are connected.  Is there some way around this?  Maybe I can make a smart cable?  And ideas?"
"I'm sure that some of you know this, but it's just a tip which might help someone out there.  As you may know, shuffle doesn't work on Alexa, but you can shuffle a playlist from your phone or tablet and choose to listen from one of your Alexa speakers (or one or two (stereo) bluetooth speakers).  But you may not realise that hours after you've asked Alexa to stop ""Alexa Stop"" when you're finished listening, that you can continue listening to the same shuffled playlist by saying ""Alexa Continue Spotify""."

"Hi all,      Yesterday I got my first Echo delivered.    I moved my bedroom's echo dot to another room and installed  the Echo.  Was pretty curious to hear the sound quality/volume but was kinda disappointed. I expected it to be a bit louder! Anyway, my room  is not huge so I figured it could still be okay.  Even though I was a bit put down considering I paid €70  for it.  (Original price €100, was on sale)    Fast forward to last night, where I was  playing online games  on the phone with my buddy, and I decided to put some Spotify on at the lowest volume as to not wake up anyone else in the house.    After a few  minutes, I noticed a low buzzing/static noise coming from the speaker.  I tried switching to Amazon music but same story. When I  finally got rid of it and said goodnight Alexa, she played the ""ok"" sound and I still  heard that friggin' noise before it went off.    **TL;DR:** My question is, is this normal for an Echo? I'm pretty sure my Dot didn't do that! I'll be testing this afternoon but  I'm kinda sure  the Echo does not have this issue.  I'm wondering if I just got a  faulty Echo or if this  is happening to everyone? If that's the case, I'm definitely returning it and getting another Dot.      Thanks!"
"Who else thinks the Amazon Prime user interface is the worst designed mess in existence? It's extremely disorganised, genres and content mixed together with no set sections, you have to scroll sideways to see what's in a particular genre which is a complete waste of screen space, there are Prime and paid options mixed together which is confusing at best, like it's Prime so just have Prime on there like Netflix has all the viewable content available on its platform and nothing else, there aren't additions you need to pay for on Netflix and paid content should have its own page entirely not mixed in the Prime content.  I also think the profiles for each selection is extremely dated and lacking in information, the profiles in Disney+ really make each selection stand out and uses nice graphics and fonts instead of the Prime interface that looks like the website only with thumbnails. Prime is desperately needing a sidebar and set sorting options instead of being buried in the middle with the content, I would also have different account profiles like Netflix and Disney+  Also, the searching functions are a joke, it only shows things sideways above the onscreen keyboard, with Netflix all the suggestions cover the whole right side of the screen, far more visual and easier to use, I think they gave the Prime experience to a bunch of interns who don't even own a TV to cobble something together that even a bunch of monkeys could do better."

"Every day, almost since I got an echo device as an early adopter, I start the morning with ""What's New"". After hearing the NY Times, I then say ""Alexa, Play the daily"", to get the NYT podcast called the daily.  Up until last month, this played the current episode of the daily - since one comes out each day. Perfect  Starting last month Alexa instead would pick up where I left off yesterday -  ""Playing episode Xyz of The Daily..... to hear the latest episode, ask me to play the latest"".     OK -- ""Alexa, play the latest"".   At this point I have a 30% chance it will work.  Today it said, ""Ok, playing abc from Pandora radio"", it projected that on my Fire TV (where my wife was watching another show and was not happy about the switch).  I have not figured out the secret words. Sometimes I get music, sometimes other podcasts, and once in a while, I actually get the latest episode.

This isn’t great to plug an Alexa lamp into since having no power when the light is off resets things and whatnot.  I’m hoping to find a device that I could use to perhaps set up a routine so that when I click on the light switch alexa  can sense it and I can set her to turn my lamp on or off based on when that plug is active or inactive. Then I could also turn that lamp on/off with voice commands, the app or whatever.  Any advice is appreciated!"
"apparently they are no longer taking phone calls but emails only even though in the email they're going to just say call tech support hence the beginning of this...lol...    ""I think this is a little redundant and a stall tactic since all you're going to do is tell me to call and to troubleshoot my issue.  I have a list of several items that I'd like to know whether or not there's a master ticket for or I would really like a complete refund for both of my show devices so I can purchase a device that works such as Google Assistant.  The start of the my list of issues is as follows: My morning alarm no longer goes off it shows on the screen but it doesn't actually go off. It does sometimes but not all the time so I'm having to set a separate alarm for the same time on my phone in order to make sure that I am up  for work....you know the thing that pays me so I can pay Amazon?  Also there is a volume discrepancy between devices for instance the increments on the show device are completely different than the increments on my phone as well as different from the increments when you just ask Alexa volume up or volume down. All the increments are completely different.  My reminders aren't working if I ask Alexa set a reminder she asks me what for I tell her then she says alarm set for blah blah blah blah time. My alarm goes off and I have no idea what the hell it's for because she didn't set it as a reminder as requested.  I have the option selected in my settings for Alexa to wait for a second request following the completion of the first request. Alexa no longer responds to my first request a simply ignores the second. meaning she hears me you can see the light at the bottom showing that she hears me but she just doesn't do anything she just stops listening. I have to ask Alexa three times to complete tasks. Which I'm quite sure you can see from my history. Anytime you see Alexa and a curse word I have already asked her twice to perform a task. Usually the word is Alexa f****** play my Kindle. she actually got mad that I cursed once I guess because she corrected me and said all you have to do to tell me to stop is say Alexa stop however I did that three times already hence the curse word.  I can only play my Kindle text to speech on unlimited on my phone now....so if I'm at work trying to listen to a book I have to take it off Wi-Fi and change it to my data plan with Verizon. It does not work correctly on Wi-Fi. It just skips back at the end of every chapter like I previously have submitted tickets for in the past with the issue that has never been resolved. Which we are going on over a year right now. As far as I know the master ticket for issues with Alexa only got submitted last month. Not sure what took you guys so long to recognize an issue. I had to upgrade my data package with Verizon to unlimited in order to accommodate my reading habit and I think I'm already paying enough money to Amazon with Kindle unlimited as well as prime membership so I'm not really sure why I'm not getting the money value from my Prime membership.  And this is really odd because if I play Mike Engel text to speech on my show on Wi-Fi there is no skipping there is no issue except for the vocabulary issue which that's a coding thing which I assume has something to do with coders being English is their second language.  my echo show is in my living room and there's another in my bedroom. The unit is way too bright for a bedroom setting. As well as the fact it really doesn't make any sense for me to be sleeping and it constantly keeps trying to show videos news adverts there really should be a way to turn that off. And I looked under the settings and as far as I know there isn't. I have my unit on the lowest brightness setting. On top of the fact I deliberately took a picture of darkness in order to put on my home screen because you guys don't even provide that not thinking that people are trying to sleep and this might be in bedrooms.  When reading my Kindle Alexa seems to be guessing at the vocabulary after three letters. If there's a name shortened for instance to Cal instead of staying in Cal she will say California. The last time I checked the abbreviation for California is CA. Not sure why Alexis guessing at words instead of reading what is there. Another example is Dec this will be short for Declan but instead of saying that she says December. That one I could almost get except why doesn't she just read what's there? She has issues with words that have double meanings for instance live and live, minute and minut and I can tell you there are several several others. As an avid reader that reads at least two to three books a week which can be confirmed by my Kindle unlimited account. It is ridiculously annoying. And please don't refer me to audible books because I would think it's ridiculous for me to be paying for a Kindle unlimited membership I'm paying double the price of what the book is for the audible version for somebody reading that completely turns me off the book. Cuz I don't feel that their voice either goes with the story or whatever. Alexis voice is impartial which is why I prefer it.  I also recently upgraded my modem. and before anyone gets excited I was having these issues before I upgraded my freaking modem do not call me or contact me stating that that's the issue. now the smart plugs that I purchased that were working just fine all of a sudden do not connect to Alexa so I have to use a separate app to run my smart plugs. And I did get this troubleshooted with tech support they could not get it to work they suggested buying Amazon plugs for triple the price. Makes it look like a scam don't you know?  These are just a few of the issues that I am having with my Alexa device and for the last year and before.  At this time since the service apparently does not seem to be on par with what is advertised any longer. Not sure what happened. I would prefer to go with a service or device that has a long-running history of no issue. And I say that using Google assistant on my phone constantly every day. But if it helps I would purchase again the smaller speaker only for my bedroom. it seems a larger Amazon is getting the more it is appearing that someone from Walmart must be running the company now.  I await your response.  PS I will be posting this on social media as well. Reddit has an excellent platform for Alexa issues and complaints not sure if you guys are taking a gander."""
"Hi there. I had an echo dot in a “room” in Alexa app, playing music on the Sonos in the same room as it was the preferred speaker. I wanted to get something with a screen to show cameras in addition to the dot’s functionality.  Rather than replace it with a show, i figured I’d get more use out of a fire hd 10 running show mode.   I encountered a few quirks i could use clarification on. You may just confirm what i found, or perhaps I’m doing something wrong.   1.	Alexa app doesn’t recognize the Fire as an echo device, so I don’t seem to be able to set it up with a preferred speaker as I did the dot. I can get around this by saying “play x on dining room”, dining room being the name of the Sonos speaker , but just confirming there’s no way to set a preferred speaker.  2.	i can’t get Spotify to work on show mode. I thought it worked with show mode?  When I’m show mode if I ask it to play music it kicks me out to the main Spotify app.  3.	The screen options max at shut off at 30 minutes. I enabled developer mode and placed it to always on. So my options are only 30 minutes or always on?  If i leave it on 24 hours will inexperience issues like burn in or out of the screen? The tablet was $100 so if lasts a year i won’t cry, but if it gets screwy after a month that’s probably not great.   Any other suggestions others have come across?  Thanks!"
i mean if not i want her to update me new things are posted and read them to me stuff like that
"The same thing happened in December, but I thought I figured that out as a possible hack.  My daughter had enabled a sketchy 3rd party christmas skill, and when I remove it, the random stuff stopped.  However, it is playing random video and text based skills again, with no corresponding command in the Activity.  I had three trusted skills active, and I disabled those just in case.  The problem has continued after that."
"TL:DR: I want to create a routine that in someways can play my original recording everyday at 17.00.   This recording cannot be found on music services like Spotify or others.     When I am in Tokyo every day at 17.00 the national broadcast system broadcasts a song named Yuuyake Koyake (this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A74ZaUj50E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A74ZaUj50E)) and this thing is now part of my daily life and when I am not in Japan I want to keep listening to his song every 17.00.   Before buying the echo dot I had a Google Mini that was doing this trough Google Play Music but now for some reasons this is no more possible (Google Support was not helpful at all, just saying that this is not possible and never was, lies).   Now I decided to switch to Alexa, or perhaps to see if Alexa is worth of her name but seems like that the two devices are very similar after all.     Is there any way I can do this?"

"I have some outdoor string lights plugged into a smart plug. Controlling them with Alexa works great, but my wife would strong prefer to control them with a physical button (e.g., on a remote) or switch.   I’ve searched high and low for a super-simple one-button remote to do this with no luck. A Logitech remote is WAY overkill and WAY too expensive. Amazon stopped making Echo Buttons.   Any ideas?"
I ask her to do one thing and she’ll do something similar. Any way to fix this?
"Goodmorning,  I need help installing my Amazon Echo Input, which came in yesterday. The problem is that when I try to install the Input in the Alexa app, it shows all other Alexa devices under Echo Devices, except for the Echo input (see photo). How am I supposed to install my Input now?"

Anything more than that and you can count on the failure rate going up quickly. I wish they would have been more clear about that up front... I wouldn't have gone with them for my whole house music system. But he reassured me that they are ""actively working on improving that"" but he also confessed that really that means they are likely waiting for internet speeds to get faster and keep improving so that their devices are more reliable.  Just thought the community might want to know what the limits are that they know but refuse to say."
Does anyone know how to use the new voiceflow choice block? I know it sounds nooby but I need help. I searched everywhere. Thank you

"I have four hue lights paired up to my Alexa, one in the living room, one out on the porch, and two in the kitchen. Recently, when I tell Alexa to turn off/on the living room light, she says that there are more than two devices with that same name even though there is only one light bulb in the living room. In the app, I delete the newfound device, but she keeps finding ""another"" living room light every day.   Is there a way for her to stop finding that light that already exists?"

"Hi,  Been trying to troubleshoot why Apple Music doesn't play on any of my Alexa devices.    * The only time it has a shot of working is if I factory reset the device(s): if I try Apple Music then, it will often work a single time. * Any other time, the Alexa command is successful in that it hears me, uses the correct Skill, and gets valid tracks and album art (on Show), but then fails with ""I'm having trouble playing the music"". * While disabling/enabling the Skill on the web, I tried playing Apple Music and when the device complained that it cannot play the music, I saw this error message: MEDIA\_ERROR\_FATAL\_BUFFER\_UNDERRUN flash in an overlay.  Heartening that I finally have prove that it's not working and even an error message to track, but there is no page that references this error on Google and one page on Bing, which points to a generic Alexa page that calls out having to open a dozen ports in a firewall (which I doubt is an issue, since iTunes is playing music fine and I'll be speechless if an IOT device should need explicit ports opened on a firewall that lets everything out).  Anyone else seen this and/or worked around this?  I would be willing to put the Alexa in the DMZ for a test but not for the long haul as that would be irresponsible at best and unholy at worst.  Thanks!"
Any ideas? It’s a cool feature but aside from gimmicky fun stuff are there any practical ideas folks have discovered?
"I deregistered and removed my old echo dot from the Alexa app after buying a new generation. I gave that echo to my boyfriend and registered my new device. this was months ago and I haven’t had any issues, but recently when I ask my new Echo to play something, she responds with “okay” or “playing xxxx” but then goes silent.  My boyfriend has informed me it is in fact playing at his house while he’s trying to work.   My commands are set up to play from the device I’m speaking to and the old echo is no where to be found in the Alexa app. Any advice on how to stop this?"
There’re nothing but spam.
"Alexa: **Alarm goes off**  Me: (Can't remember word for stop) ""Alexa, okay""  Alexa: To play specific songs, you'll need to sign up for-  Me: ""ALEXA"" (thinking I got her off the subject of paying for something and still can't remember the word for stop, but still need to turn off the alarm)"", okay""  Alexa: You now have Amazon Music Unlimited on this Echo Dot. Playing Okay, by Shiba San   In what world does saying the one word ""Okay"" mean ""play me the song 'Okay'"", as opposed to ""Okay Alexa, I hear your alarm, you can turn it off now, I get it""  As to why I said okay again after being told I would be signed up for Amazon Music, Alexa never completed her full sentence so I was never told I would be charged for saying yes, or even what I would be charged for. I interrupted her immediately as I recognized she did not understand me and was doing something else, so I was never told that giving a verbal yes would make me pay for anything I also just woke up, and people who just woke up aren't known for thinking straight"
"I have never worked with an alexa device before and was wondering if one could have alexa internally say a command to herself before outputting a response to your command. For example if I said, ""Alexa  turn of the lights"", alexa would first perform the skill, ""Alexa ask Kodi to pause"", before playing, ""Ok turning off the lights"", then she would perform ""Alexa ask Kodi to resume"", all before turning off the lights. This would automatically pause any movies or music (if any) already playing off my Kodi box before she said something then resume the action, and finally perform the task. Please let me know if this is possible."
"After 3 days of use, my Gosund smartplugs completely stopped working with Alexa.  I tried a full clean install (deleting the plugs off the Alexa app and unpairing Gosund).

In the last couple of days, the Dot with Clock (in the bedroom) has started saying ""Sorry, I can't access your Radio Nova skill right now"". It plays other radio stations fine  It still works on the Dot and the Show, and I can get the Dot with Clock to play the station through the phone app.  Any ideas?"
So I've got a Dot and a Fire stick. If I ask the dot to play something and there is more than one option she says.... 'This is what I've found' and give results on the fire stick on the TV. Now if I had the remote I would simply move it right and select.... But I don't.  If I then say... Play 'and read exactly what is above what I want' she repeats the same.... This is what I've found and shows the results.  How on earth do I get her to play what I want!  With Google you simply say option 1 2 or 3 etc. So won't do that!

"My echo dot randomly gave me the red ring and can’t connect (even though my Alexa in the other room is working perfectly fine). I tried power cycling, that didn’t work. So I reset the entire thing and set it up again in the Alexa app. We used to call it Echo as it’s wake word, now it has decided it wants to be called Alexa again. Ok no worries, I’ll just change its wake word. Under the settings it just says Loading... forever under wake word and when I tap on that it shows the options but they’re all greyed out. No clue how to get it back to normal now. Thanks for the help"
"Just watching a bit of tv  and suddenly Alexa wakes up and started singing. Scared the crap out of me and no wake word was said, I even skipped back the tv a couple of minutes to make sure. The screen wakes itself up all the time these days but never had it burst into song before. lol"
"So, this is something strange that just happened. I bought a new LG OLED TV that supports Alexa. After linking my accounts, everything was working well for a few days. Then, last night when I asked my Echo to turn the TV off, it responded that ""The skill linked with TV is not enabled. Please enable the skill to control this device"". However, what's *super* weird is that if I turn the TV off manually, and ask Alexa to turn the TV **on,** it works perfectly fine.  As far as I can tell, everything is still linked correctly. I have the LG ThinQ Basic skill enabled, and if I remove the TV it's added back via device discovery.  Any idea what's going on here?"

I would like the skill Sleep Sounds to start for an allotted period of time but this doesn't appear to be an option. I can see there are functions to ""Wait X Minutes"" and ""Stop audio on ALL Devices"", but if I add the skill for sleep sounds, I'm told, ""Skills must be the last action in a routine"". This means I can't turn it off with the aforementioned functions and Sleep sounds just plays on a continual loop.  Am I doing something wrong or is there another way? Seems odd how you cant set the length of time for Sleep sounds to run for."
"For some reason Alexa won't allow me to pause or turn off a podcast. The only thing I can do to turn off a podcast I'm not into is ask her to play something else, like a song.

"Recently we have bought my grandma an Echo show (5? I think), and have been using it for single contact Skype calls great.  however every time we try to initiate a group conversation using it doesn’t seem to work, but we have previously done group calls fine on other devices.

I'm just sitting at my computer just reading stuff on Reddit and my Alexa turned on and for some reason decides to play rock music. Now at the time this occurred the tv was playing a commercial this one  [https://www.ispot.tv/ad/Z3oq/amazon-music-a-voice-is-all-you-need-alicia-keys](https://www.ispot.tv/ad/Z3oq/amazon-music-a-voice-is-all-you-need-alicia-keys) and the moment the commercial ended  that's when my Alexa turned on and kinda freaked me out.
"Alexa now supports DTS Play-Fi enabled devices as valid Alexa ""Preferred"" audio devices.    I just installed [DTS Play-Fi](https://play-fi.com/apps/windows/) on my Windows 10 home theater PC .  However, my Alexa Dot doesn't find my PC when searching for DTS Play-Fi enabled devices.  Both devices are on the same LAN.  What's the trick to get Alexa to see my Win10 PC as a preferred audio device?  Has anyone successfully done this?  I definitely want to get this working since an analog line to my PC introduces too much noise."

"I noticed about a week ago that my HP Deskjet printer was now a device listed on my Alexa app.  I then got an email saying thank you for connecting my printer, and here are things to try.  Worked nice for a few days where you could say Alexa, print a daily Suduko or even print a Hard Suduko.  My problem is that when I did that today, Alexa tells me hmm, I don't know that skill, but I have another skill you might like.  Any ideas on why it connected, and now will not?  btw, it will still print a to do list or shopping list.  thanks."

After resetting it and connecting it to the internet, Alexa said: ""Updating your device, I'll let you know when it's ready."" and the orange ring was spinning for a long time. 1-2 hours and it was still spinning. Eventually, the color changed to a glowing purple color. I had reset it again and the problem persists. I tried plugging the adapter out for 15-20 seconds and that didn't help either.

Is there a way to turn on/off my Sony VPL-HW45ES projector with Alexa ? I’ve seen some posts with Harmony Hub but I was wondering if there were other options. I have a Denon AVR-X3500 which has HEOS and I can turn the receiver ON/OFF using Alexa. Is there a way to tie these 2 together (without the harmony hub). I have a Harmony Ultimate One universal remote. Not sure if I can do anything with it. I don’t think this model has an RJ45 port. Thanks in advance.
I just ordered three of the Dot 3rd gens to see what I was missing and BOY I was not!   This is the most useless piece of garbage. First off you need to yell at the thing and the dot is hard to hear around the room. The bass is way too high so the voice is rumbly not good for hearing. When it does get you half the time it doesn't know what your talking about. You need to remember specific commands because anything else is not close enough. Most of the skills are garbage and the reviews show it. The abode skill is trash it doesn't even make noise if someone goes in the door. The ring app apparently is the same way. The plex skill is completely broken and not working couldn't get it to play anything. The roku skill sucks. If you turn the tv off with the remote its unable to turn it back on. It also cannot launch many apps. The only thing it can do it tune antenna tv.  Half the time the wrong Dot responds to my commands and I can hear it rumbling in the other room.   I ended up realizing I can do all this stuff quicker and easier without alexa. Sending them all back. What a disappointment. Not worth spending hours fiddle farting with something that's supposed to make my life easier.
"I'm so fucking sick of her not listening having to repeat myself doing the wrong thing having no idea what I'm talking about and just generally being a big bag of dicks. All eight of them in the trash. No more of that shit for me. From the day I got them they have gone downhill ever since.   No you can't have my address, trash comes tomorrow."
"I have a Dot and an Input and I would like to have them on either side of the room and use them as a ""single device with extended mic range.""   i.e. if I am near the Input, and I say ""Alexa, what's the weather?"" I would like the output to come out of the Dot's speaker, even if the input picks up the command. Is there a way to do this?"
"I purchased a 3rd generation Dot and sent the 2nd generation to the kitchen. I have a lot of reminders and alarms on the 3rd that I don't want on the 2nd. I've tried to deregister several times, through the app and website. I e-mailed Amazon and followed their official instructions. I even created a second Amazon account just for the second gen. Finally, Alexa started asking me to sign the ""Terms of Use"" through the app, but I found nothing to click on."
"Hi! I live in Mexico and I had been using Amazon Music Unlimited for more than a year, ever since I got my first Echo Dot. I actually enjoyed Amazon's music service, but I was an Apple Music user for years and I always thought Apple's recommendations were  better. So when a couple months ago Apple said that Apple Music was available in Mexico I was excited. I waited until my subscription to Music Unlimited was over and I figured out how to make Apple Music work with Alexa and my Echoes.  Now, my question is: Do you really have to \*ask\* Alexa to play something? Like… is it the only way? Because with the Music Unlimited app I could select a playlist and then songs and just add them to ""play next"" and just press a button to play everything on my Echo…  I find that Alexa always messes up artists' names and albums… and I also listen to lots of music in different languages that I'm sure I'm not able to pronounce correctly (let alone Alexa understanding them). Is there a work around this?"
I tried to see if there was a thread about this already but can't find one so I figured I'd just re-ask.   How do you get Alexa to notify you when a package is delivered from another Home User - currently Alexa only tells me when my stuff has arrived but not my wife's.

"Me and my lady just picked up Gen 3 dots, and we were testing the calling feature, both of us in our own homes, relatively close to the dots having a convo, and as 1 person is speaking, it basically mutes the other until your done speaking.   We did a test like this:  Person A counted up to 10.    Person B tried to talk during the counting, and person A could barely, if not at all, hear person B try to talk.   My lady thinks sometimes im ignoring her or cutting her off, but i cant even hear her all the time as shes speaking. I know its wifi calling, but we both have great signal too."
"This is driving me crazy. I've bought IR emitter and thermostat from certain brand to use in office. I was able to have the Alexa app on my iPad discover these and operate them from home.

I live in Malaysia and have a number of Echo Dots spread around my home to voice control lights/fans/aircons/tv etc. Lately i have been experiencing incredible delayed responses from Alexa. I'll ask it to turn on a light for example and it the blue light on top spins for about 30 seconds before the action happens. If i use the Alexa App or the Devices own App its instant. So it has something to do with the voice.  Interestingly if i use my mobile network there is no issue. This leads  me to suspect internet/internet provider or router setting.  Has anyone experienced this issue before? Is there a setting i could perhaps change on my router?
"I listened to pandora this afternoon on one of my echoes. It strangely created it's own station that I would never listen to. After I resolved that, all was fine.

I checked the alexa app and reset the device and everything should be fine, but nothing is found. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. All of my stations are built in pandora.

I've set her up an Amazon account in order to set up the show, but the lack of device meant I logged in to her Alexa account on my phone and linked my number.   I have a couple of question, can I change the linked number to her mobile ? I assume I can. But how do I set up the account so that we can ""phone"" her Echo. Is there a way to send out a link or a contact card ?  The other option I have is I have a Kindle fire doing nothing at home, I can set up the Alexa app on that, but I think we will be in the same boat with regards adding contacts.   Anyone got any advice or hints. I can't get her a smartphone she just won't be able to use it. I want her to be able to shout ""Alexa, contact....xxxx"""

"Maybe this is an obvious fix... as in just move them further away from each other.

I recently got an Amazon echo dot and have had it for four days now. Today it started slowly blinking yellow but when I follow the advice I found online and asked it to read my messages it just replies that I need to register if I want to send or receive messages and the app shows no sign of anything happening. It's starting to get on my nerves.
"I love the fact that Alexa is compatible with nearly any home automation device you can find.  With that said the more devices that are added the more complex my setup becomes and the more names and phrases that must be remembered and taught to others in the house.  Reality is that even though voice control is cool sometimes it’s nice to just pickup the phone and see it visually.  I think HomeKit is a beautiful well laid out app, SmartThings also but both have limited devices which are compatible.   I know the Alexa app gives you the ability to control things via touch but the experience is like an 80s DOS version.  Do you think we will ever see a better app experience for Alexa or is the way of the future a focus on voice?"

"My mom and I both have Echo Dot devices.

My mom’s end of the call takes place on her Echo Dot.   There doesn’t seem to be any way of making Alexa use my Dot to make the call.   Maybe I’m missing something, but why would this ever be a thing? If I want to use my phone to call someone, what does Alexa add to that process? Why wouldn’t I just call her *with the phone*?  How can I force Alexa to ignore my phone and just make a Dot-to-Dot call?"

She woke me up again with then “dnnn-dunnn” disconnecting sound, despite being on do not disturb!! I pulled the plug and now I’m here making this post while my heart rate slows back down.  First of all, she doesn’t auto connect to anything except my laptop and it’s really irritating.  Second of all, why tf would she make sounds on do not disturb????? Anybody have any advice???"

"Seriously, why can't you just type stuff in on Alexa?  I need Alexa or something like it but there are no options for those of us who aren't pretentious douchebags who need to broadcast their every little thought to the world.

I could not set up a routine in Alexa to arm the system at a certain time each night, but by enabling Alexa Guard, it will arm the system.  My problem is that it only will arm the system in away mode.  Which means if I forget, and walk out in the living room, I set off the alarm.  To solve this I've disabled the motion, but that is not ideal.  Is there any way to modify Alexa Guard so that it arm the system in Home mode?  thanks."

Every day you can challenge another Alexa user to check who knows more about the game ⚽  [Here's how the skill looks like on the Echo Show.](https://imgur.com/1wG33sh)  I'm currently looking for a few beta testers to get early access to the skill and test the UK / US versions.  Who's interested?"
"This has been going on for about a week. I’ve tried power cycling and everything. It is a few years old, an echo dot. Is it just done?"
"Seems in the last week or so a change was made where now the only response when adding things to my shopping list is a rather curt-sounding ""added"" rather then a read back of what Alexa thought you wanted like before.  However, this isn't always perfect. Example, my daughter wanted ""Milky Way"" candy, somehow Alexa heard it as ""milk"" and ""rice."" Needless to say my daughter wasn't as excited when I returned from market with a litre milk jug and a bag of basmati rice.  Can I have them go back to previous behaviour??"
"I am wondering If there is a way to set an if/then condition with an Alexa routine. For example, when I play my ""goodnight"" or ""good morning"" routine I would like Alexa to change the temperature on my thermostat based on the condition of either the current weather outside or current temp inside. For a further example, goodnight would trigger it to change to 70 degrees -if- it is over 80 degrees outside. Is this possible?"
"Title. I used an Echo Dot to play music on my Sonos, and she did the creepy laugh glitch right after the music started."
"All her other functionalities work, but she will not stay anything during reminders. It’s really odd. She wakes up and the blue rings flash, but no voice. I was wondering if anyone had experienced this or had a fix?"
"When i say ""alexa play from eden by hozier"" It just says ""from eden radio"" And plays a completly diffrent song I own an echo dot This problem just happened now and i just got my alexa 2 weeks ago Any help?"
So my WiFi went down last night due to thunderstorms. I was already awake when I realized that neither of my morning alarms went off. I have two routines set to go off at 6:00am and 6:10am that change the volume and play a song to wake me up in the morning. Obviously this didn’t affect me this time but in the future it could. I think it’s kinda dumb how a simple routine like this gets completely canceled just because I have no internet connection.
"Bought Samsung sound bar  **HW-Q90R** , and on the box it says its compatible with Alexa , but we need a skill called Samsung wireless audio who doesnt exist on the Amazon Alexa market for Spanish language.  I contacted samsung through forums but they only said they are working on it ... 3 months passed since then...     Is there any solution to fix this without having to wait for samsung ?"
"At night, I want Alexa to play Weightless by Marconi Union (the 10 hour version), but can't find out a way to actually play the song. The options are Spotify, Amazon Music, My Library (which is apparently not my phone's music library), iHeartRadio, and TuneIn  None of these have this version of the song available, though. But I know someone who used to have this set up, so it's possible.   Song for reference https://youtu.be/qYnA9wWFHLI"
"I listen to instrumental music or rainstorm sounds when I’m falling asleep. My Alexa has recently been having some buffering issues and will say “Sorry, I’m having trouble playing the music right now,” which jars me awake. I don’t care if she just stops, but is there a way to turn off that notification? Thank you."
"Even though she should be able to understand Spanish she cannot, is there a way to fix it?"
"The words ""on"" and ""off"" sound too similar - about 1/3 of the requests I make to turn lights on and off, Alexa responds ""Okay"" but nothing changes. I ask ""what did you hear?"" and Alexa heard the opposite of what I said - heard ""off"" for ""on"", or ""on"" for ""off"".  As the title says, is there an alternative for these words to eliminate the ambiguity?"
"As the title says, I just purchased these two products. I have the fire stick connected to my projector in my bedroom. The Echo Studio was able to connect to my firetv no problem and it functions great as a speaker. but I can’t seem to get the remote to sync via Bluetooth with the studio. I’ve followed all instructions online and they won’t discover each other. So now I have to always ask Alexa to turn the volume down which is fine during the day but annoying if I’m trying to just relax in bed. Anyone have any tips?"
"Hi everyone.  My Echo Show 5 arrived today and I was expecting to use it as an external sound device for my MP3 on the phone (podcasts) and I checked the specifications earlier.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/604fnqotygn41.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbbbe49031da0193d8b0cf7ea4c8be56b7158e4e  My phone also have this A2DP technology (Zenfone 4)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/nvg0qbwyygn41.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f4b426a2d2158038cf4df6a579c1e32f7817642  However, I' not able to find the Echo on my devices bluetooth list.

"Guys what do you think of the Google Home App user interface? Do you think it delivers a good experience? Do you think it could be improved in any way? I think it can get much better, so I decided to redesign the app to see if I can improve it and make it easier to use :) Please, help me in this initial phase by answering this form that I prepared to understand the user's difficulties.

"So earlier today I was talking to myself as I often do when doing stuff around the house, when Alexa says ""That's good to know""."
"Why does Alexa read events on my Google calendar twice? Like ""you have an appointment at 10 called Doctor and at 10 called Doctor.""  Is there a fix?"
"Whenever I speak to her nicely and say please, she just responds with a sad bleep. If I talk to her strictly and order her around like a piece of filth, she responds every time. I think she's into it.  Should I report this as a bug, or is it a feature?"
Just repeats the previous song.
For the last day or so my Echo Show was having trouble connecting to the internet but my Echo dots were working perfectly.  Today I tried re adding the device after a factory reset but there is no echo show visible on the Amazon Alexa device list and nothing else is an option.  Any advice on what to try next?
"Ok so this one is a tough one to google.. basically, I just have echo dots in many rooms around the house and when we use broadcast they are all very slightly out of sync- making it very difficult to properly hear the message. I feel like this is new problem. Anyone else have this issue? Any suggestions to solve it?"
"So I have an echo dot and so does my sister, and whenever i play music I play trough hers is there something I can do to fix it?"
"So my roommate is very forgetful. He more times than he should, he forgets that he or I put my dogs outside to do business. And they sometimes end up outside for hour or more and that gets worrisome. Is there a way to set a routine to have Alexa set a...say 5-10 minute timer. Like ""Alexa! dogs are outside."" And she sets a timer and reminds to bring them in or at least check on them. Or would it just end up needing to just set a timer."
"If you ask to set a timer, Alexa Show will show the countdown on the screen... for about 10 seconds and then it brings back the default screen.  Anyway to keep the timer showing for the full duration?"
"I asked my alexa to compliment me and she said ""I like your toes"". Bruh"
"Hi guys!  Recently I read that it was possible to pair two Echo Dots to work as a stereo system.  So I decided to buy two more of them (already had one) and paired them.   But I want to use them as the pc speaker system.  I've been trying to make it work through bluetooth, but all I get is audio from one of the Echo Dots, instead of the stereo system.  Do you know if it's possible?  Thank you in advance!"
Is it possible to have Alexa turn Sports Center on my tv when I disable my morning alarm?
I want a song to play at the chorus instead of start on a wake up routine.
TLDR: Use the Do Not Disturb feature and don't get flashing yellow at 3AM.  It's a painful lesson I learned the other night  [https://smarthomeexplained.com/why-is-alexa-flashing-yellow/](https://smarthomeexplained.com/why-is-alexa-flashing-yellow/)
"Hi there. I'm thinking of buying an Amazon Echo, but except from all the other capabilities, I need to know if I can use it for an exact setup.  Right now i have my PS4pro hooked on a Samsung 55"" Smart Tv, and the speakers (Logitech Z906) connected to the PS4 via optical cable. I play music from my Smartphone (Samsung s9) directly to my speakers via the PS4.   My question; is Amazon Echo capable of playing music, searching etc through the speakers/phone? Or any other setup I could create?  Thanks a lot for your attention, and keep safe"
"Is there an easy way for me to turn on and off a light that I had plugged into my Amazon smart plug with one (or at least very few) button press?  I use it solely turn on a secondary light in my bedroom and at night I don't want to have to yell into my kitchen area (where my Alexa is) to turn it off or go through the whole Amazon app in order to turn the lights on and off.  Help me, please 😊"

Does anyone know if you can change the wake word on these? In the Alexa app they show up under accessories and I don't see the option but I'm not sure if I'm missing it.
"So, I've got a new Echo Dot 3rd Gen. Whenever there is a power cut and the Power is back, the Echo does not take the command then after.   Whenever I try, it shows me Red Light saying ""Sorry I'm not able to process your request, Please try later""  I have to manually go and switch off the Echo and then switch ON and then everything works fine.   P.S I have already rest the Echo Dot.  Is this by design or My Echo Dot is faulty?"

"Hola a todos, quería exponeros una duda:  Seria posible tener dentro de una misma cuenta de Amazon ( misma cuenta de correo), distintos dispositivos echo, pero en diferentes ubicaciones, y cada uno de ellos con una configuración diferente y dispositivos diferentes ?  Para un mejor entendimiento, os expongo un ejemplo:  Imaginad que en un mismo recinto existen diferentes bungalows, en los que en cada uno de ellos hay una red wifi diferente, y para cada uno de los Echo´s la configuración es orientada a una persona de una diferente nacionalidad o pais.   Seria esto posible ? Me puse en contacto con el servicio tecnico de amazon especifico de alexa y me dijeron cosas distintas segun la persona que me atendía.  Espero que me podáis ayudar, gracias."
"Does anyone have a solution to this issue? It is driving me insane!  Recently, Alexa started saying where the sound is playing from. For example, when I press play on a video on my computer, Alexa goes *'now playing from Macbook Pro'*. There is absolutely no need for Alexa to tell me the sound is playing from my computer.  1) I previously connected my computer to Alexa via Bluetooth  2) I pressed play on my computer before Alexa tells me it's playing from my computer  I don't understand the point of this feature. Because Alexa speaks screams *'now playing from Macbook Pro'* over the actual content, I always need to rewind when she's done talking.  It seems impossible to disable this new and useless feature. Does anyone have a solution? **Help!**"
"I’ve been using Alexa to keep track of time when playing some games. I have her start both a 30 minute timer and a 10 minute timer and every time the 30 minute timer ends, I start both again. I am trying to start both of these timers from a routine so I don’t have to start both separately each time, but I can’t find a way."
It’s perfect.
"I have several Echos in my house, but one is particularly nicer.  It adds things like ""Have a good day"" and such to its messages (time, weather, etc).  None of the others do this and I don't see a setting for it.  Am I missing something?"
"So, I have my Alexa finally connected to my Phillips hue. When I first connect them together everything seems to work dandy... All of the lights have the settings working perfect fine; however, after a few hours Alexa changes the values to the individual lightbulbs to show that they cannot change colors... Does anyone know why she does this and how to stop it? I feel like there are so many glitches on Alexa and the Alexa team don't know shit or want to work on it."
"Hi, every now and then my photos (from my amazon photos area) stop working (background slideshow) for about a minute and I get a the dark blue ""photos/camera"" background before it then starts displaying my photos again.   It started doing this a couple of months ago. Even limited it to a smaller album, but no luck. Internet connection is fine and steady. Have restarted the device."
"This has started over the last month or so, where I will say a command to play some music, play some rain sounds through a skill, etc and the Alexa will set the volume to 0.   It's kind of a first world problem I know, but I spent a fair chunk of money on this and it's annoying to have to keep setting the volume up again.   Anyone else been experiencing this?"
"I’ve paid for Amazon music for over a year now. For the last month I’ve been having music interrupted with advertisements. I’ve contacted Amazon a few times, but it’s been way more frequent the last week  Anyone else having the same problem?  Btw, the way I fix it is telling Alexa to Shutup and then play music again"
"I have an alternate local dns programmed on my local network. Watching traffic flow, the Alexa units constantly reach out to 8.8.8.8, which I have blocked on my firewall.   Anyone else seeing similar behavior?  DHCP is not pushing any non local dns out so this is a programmed behavior on the units."

"I just bought another Echo and an Echo Sub to go with my already existing Echo. I paired them all together and they all play amazing, I'm really happy with the quality of this system. But when I tried to connect it to my phone to listen to music from youtube or tried to connect it to my computer, it would only let me pair one Echo, not the whole system. None of them Have an AUX-IN either. Is there any way I can connect it to my computer or phone via Bluetooth?"
"Hi everyone! I need help. I need to enable the following scenario: My kids when they get home from school should be able to call me on my Alexa app on my iPhone! How exactly do I set this up? The Echo show is connected to my amazon account, as is the Alexa app on my iPhone. And since I live in Croatia there is no option for Alexa to call me on my cell number, so the call should be made strictly from my Echo Show to the Alexa iOS app, not to my number.  Please help, thanks!"
"We have Alexa Dots and Shows  throughout our house. I was wondering if there was a command or skill that one could say that does a jingle/song/etc. for 30 seconds that would help kids (and adults) ensure they are washing for 30 seconds?     \*I know I can say ""Alexa set a timer for 30 seconds.

"We have a few Alexa/Echo stations around the house (including Dot, Studio, and this one Echo Show), and everything usually works fine. The Echo Show is in the kitchen, and over the last few days it's started to say ""Sorry, something went wrong!"" as soon as anyone says ""Alexa!"" but before finishing the request. It will interrupt me and talk over me to say this ""Sorry..."" statement.   We have a station in almost every room, and one of the other stations will usually hear the request at the same time and respond accordingly. Even when I'm in the living room and ask Alexa for something, the I can hear the kitchen station say ""Sorry, something went wrong!"" from the other room, while the living room station completes the request.   For example, say I want to play music. I would ordinarily say ""Alexa, play music by Weird Al Yankovic"" and Alexa would say something along the lines of ""Here's a playlist of Weird Al music that I think you'll enjoy!"" and then proceed to play the music. Now I'll say ""Alexa..."" (kitchen station interrupts to say ""Sorry, something went wrong!"", but I keep talking...), ""Play music by Weird Al"", and the other Echo station (living room, etc.), will fulfill the request as usual.   The kitchen Echo Show WILL actually output the music with the rest of the stations, but doesn't interact properly with the commands.   Sorry if this is a bit of a confusing explanation, but please let me know if you have experienced anything like this and/or know what I can do about it. We've tried unplugging the Show and letting it rest without power for a while, but have stopped short of doing a factory reset to try and see if there are other options before having to re-link everything.   Thanks!"
I used to love to ask Alexa for the news every morning and she would go through the quick few minute segment with NPR news followed by the weather then say have a good day. Now instead she says here are more stories... it's super annoying! Any way to turn this off?

I try playing Spotify using both the Spotify and Alexa apps but it won't play music.   I deleted the stereo group and tried to recreate it.  but it still doesn't play music.  I checked the network connection and all speakers are on the same same network so that shouldn't be the problem.   I'm ready to throw this thing out the window.  I've had it for a year and a half and the speaker group has given me much more trouble than it's worth.   Anyone solve this issue, and any advice?"
"This is weird, just wondering if it’s common. Upstairs in bed, on the phone, when all of a sudden I start hearing faint classical piano downstairs. Thinking I was about to fall victim to some pretentious serial killer, grabbed the bat I keep under my bed and made my way downstairs. I ask Alexa to turn on the lights and the music stops momentarily for the lights to turn on. So, it’s just the Echo Show in the kitchen playing Vivaldi. Checked the doors and windows, then retreated back to my room.   In the Alexa app, I can hear my voice saying, “Alexa, play piano,” as clear as day with voices in the background. A few nights ago I had people over and asked for piano music...not since.  Is this a common bug?"

"My brother and I set up an echo show in my dad's hospital room on my Alexa account. The facility is on lock down and he's very ill so we may never see him again. (cancer, not a virus, but the lockdown due to virus). I am able to drop in and video chat with him, but when my brother, as a contact on my account, drops in, he gets assigned to my show in my kitchen. So I turned off drop in on that device, and it went to my room.. I have a LOT of devices in my home and my rentals. How does he specify what device to go to?     He says he clicks communicate (he lives in another state so I can't see his screen). He clicks drop in and all it shows is ""Sally's house"" and then randomly connects to a device. We tried, ""Alexa, connect to dad"" and tried going to my contact itself. Nothing.      Please help."
"Hello. I have had an echo dot for a while now, but I still cannot figure out why I have a hard time playing music from Spotify on it. My family has the family plan, my dad being the “main” account I guess you could say (he sent the invites to the rest of my family). I tried to connect my echo dot to my Spotify account, which worked. However, when I played music from it, it would stop suddenly. Turns out, my dad’s music would stop playing when I played a song. Same with the rest of my family.   Is the echo dot not able to play my Spotify music independently? Do I need to have my own Spotify account? I am not entirely sure what the problem is. Is there a way I could fix this? It’s a bummer that I can’t play my music on it, because that was the main reason why I got it. Any explanation/help is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."
"Alexa recently gained the feature where on every phone notification while sleeping it will remind me I have a phone, what it's name is, that it has Bluetooth, and that I told it to connect, every time the device makes a noise.  Every time the phone gets a notification of any description now, Alexa will announce..  ""Now playing from blah blah blah""   As if I didn't do the following.  1. Tell it to connect to the phone 2. Leave it connected to the phone  The sound could be replaced with trumpets and it would have the same effect, as I use my 4th dot as a bedside speaker to listen to things as I fall asleep.  Now however it has the ability to wake me up to remind me I have a phone and told it to connect to my phone.  The functional use of trumpets announcing my phone's presence truly baffles the mind, as I told it to connect to my phone, not cherish and worship my phone's existence.  I'm a nightshift worker awake during the day now to leave this message somewhere because my echo just woke me up to announce to the world my phone made a light beep to advise me of a notification, while it's on brief mode, in the longest way possible as a simple ""no sound at all"" would serve the purpose here.  As the purpose appears to not be present, but rather distant from earth and humans of the mind to think the one singular time about a thing.  If there were further proof that lizard people have taken over the planet who don't sleep and have memories with the capacity of a rice cracker made out of a rock I'm not sure what more is needed. The reason for this is the following.  1. I told Alexa to do the following.    A. Connect to my phone.  And then it did so, and I never then told it to do the following...     B(not present, as it did not occur). Disconnect from my phone.  Yet someone thought it was important to announce this when you have to also keep Alexa's volume up for alarms and such, and so as a bedside speaker will then be blasted at Mac volume with..  Now playing from blah blàh blah!  As if it itself is proud of it's very old and tired ability to connect to and disconnect from and subsequently play audio from a phone. As well as it's immediate notice of my phone's name and subsequent beginning of the religion of blah blah blàh to become the proud supporter of my phone while I'm trying to sleep.  So I guess the question is, what functional use has this announcement aside from the above? And the answer to that question must then be to assault me while I'm trying to sleep with words that someday will cause me to attack people when they say something like...  ""Oh hey what's that now playing from?""  And then me suddenly hearing the kill bill music and all that you know because I'm loosing hours and hours of sleep to a feature that if I accept is necessary will cause me to become aggressively apathetic because the feature exists soley to remind people they have a phone and I'm not sure I'm willing to go down the thought process that people really actually are of such simple mind today that this is necessary.  Anyway knowing vbs and Java the button to disable this feature should take a solid 10-15 minutes so I hope to see this before falling into a sleepless insanity soon after dealing with this for months.  Thank you. If the feature already exists just lét me know what it is any you'll be saving me from the following...  1. Lizard people. 2. Phone cult."
This: “Alexa: turn off kitchen AND dining room” Not this: “Alexa: turn off kitchen (follow up command) Turn off dining room”  You should be able to say things like “Alexa: turn on lamp and turn off fan” as a single statement.
"I keep my Alexa in the living room where my family is most of the time, and they often use her to play music. Asking Alexa to play music without specifying what music makes her play my music from my Amazon music account, and I don't want them to be listening to my music. Once this happened, but luckily I was there to stop it in time. Is there any way to disable it or am I going to have to just be careful?"
Is this an oversight? Haha There’s a lot of limitations the PC version of Alexa has in comparison.  I can’t “find my phone” for example. I can’t play announcements either.   I hope they take some time to work on this. My smart home setup would greatly benefit.
"I'm starting today with Alexa and routines, and now I'm stuck in how I can play a mp3 file (that is stored in my smartphone).  I need to upload it to somewhere?  I saw at the routines section that you can select ""Play from My Library"" but that's my phone library or Amazon Music library?  Please, someone can help me out?  Thanks in advice!"
So I have connected some of my tech (Xbox one and Samsung TV via IFTTT) to Alexa in hopes of switching it on and off. It works when the tech has been on already but the next day I’ll go to do it and it won’t work until I have turned it on how it would normally be done. Anyone else find this to be the case? And know a fix? I have reconnected my Xbox a couple of times but the problem seems to not be the connection but the time between the tech being turned on and the voice command.
"I use my tablet and Alexa for a game with friends and instead of keeping a long list on hand, is there a way to have Alexa read out a randomly selected item from a list of over 300 items?"
"I'm a former Echo user that moved to Google Home a while back but have been frustrated with the general bug-ridden nature of Google's products (specifically in regards to Bluetooth staying connected on the Google Home). I'm thinking about switching back to the Echo.     I like to have a nightly automation setup on my smart speaker so that when I say ""Good night"", the speaker sets a certain volume and then plays rain sounds. When I did this on my Echo years ago, it used to ask me to confirm opening the sleep sounds skill before continuing. Does it still do this when part of a routine? Or will it just play without further questioning?"
"Hi everyone,   I got 3 different time for wake up (depends on work shift).

Any advice, site to google or anything who could help me?"
I have a xiaomi mi A3 and I'd like to trigger the app which controls its IR through an echo dot (3rd gen).

I read something about anymote but i live in Italy and it seams there is no anymote skill here.

"My parents’ WiFi is pretty bad. The speed is fine and it doesn’t actually disconnect from my device (WiFi icon never disappears) but the actual router momentarily disconnects from the internet frequently.

"I have 2 Kasa Smart plugs that I use in combination with Alexa. Because of some issues, I deleted them and added them back in the Kasa app.  I also synched that up in the Alexa app. They show up but the skill is disabled (even though it is enabled in the app). My Echo tells me to disable/enable the skill and still no luck. What can I do?"

Basically nothing on Android works with AlexaCast but everything seems to work with Chromecast.
Are there any apps that can control devices registered with alexa on a touchscreen monitor? The native windows 10 app for Alexa does a half decent job of it:  https://preview.redd.it/z7mf3cdn3ql41.png?width=1899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=379b08d4ef29a908eba677f6f8b7fdf55cc4b8df  but this app doesn't fill the whole screen and changes to the alexa home screen after a certain period.

"I have 4 rooms with bond-controlled fans. Ideally I would like to be able to turn on the fan by saying 'alexa turn on the fan' like it does with the lights, but it always asks me to specify which fan I would like to turn on even though it is in the group/ room. This is pretty frustrating because I don't want to be have to say the full name of the fan. Since this feature doesn't exist, are there any workarounds I can try?   \#firstworldproblems"
"Anytime I am asking my echo show to play or skip a song, when the next one starts she starts freaking out. For example,  Echo, shuffle classic rock.  “Ok k k k k kkkkk kkkkk k k k. Her rerererrrrrrrre is some classsssssss icicicicicic rock.”   And then it will usually not do anything for about 3-5 seconds and then the song starts normally."
"I used to be able to play SiriusXM radio from my Echo but now it won’t play anything except the Chill channel. Every request, no matter how I phrase it, I am told it can’t find that channel, station name, genre, etc. The only time it works is if I say “Alexa, play SiriusXM” and then it just plays the Chill channel which I hate. The SiriusXM skill says that if it won’t play then turn off the explicit language for music but my Alexa app doesn’t have that option at all.  Anyone have any idea why It doesn’t? Any idea how to make SiriusXM work again?"

Essentially looking for something at door that could be enabled in something like drop-in mode between front porch and inside.

"I’m trying to design an Alexa routine where I ask her to set a timer, and if I don’t ask her to cancel it before the timer runs out, to turn off and on the power strip connected to my computer. (This program is in place to determine if my computer really has crashed while loading my game, or if it’s just taking a long time.) I think I know how to pull it off, but it will only start if an alarm is dismissed. Does a finished timer qualify as an alarm going off?"

"So I had to reset my Hue Bridge so I am in the process of creating my Groups again.

"I recently bought new light for my bedroom, all Philips hue - white ambience. I downloaded the Philips Hue Bluetooth app from the store (not the normal Philips Hue as I do not have a Hue bridge) and setup the lights. Everything in the Philips app seems to work fine. Then I asked Alexa to ""find my devices"" and it found the three bulbs. In the first minutes, I was able to say ""Alexa turn off the third light"" and alexa dot turned it off (tested on all three).  Afterward, I was looking at the Philips app just to rename my bulbs and went back to the Amazon Alexa app to find out that only 'First Light' was working and the rest, 'Second Light' and 'Third Light', were unresponsive. I tried to forget all lights and search again for new devices but the result was always the same - Alexa was finding all, but only the 'First Light' was responsive. Also, I moved the dot closer but it did not work.  Any idea why this is happening?"

"I have a first gen dot in the front room.  When connected either via bluetooth or cable to an external speaker it routs EVERYTHING to it.  It seems like every sort of speaker I connect ends up with a second or two ""wake up"" time where alexa's audio prompts are cut off.... either because the bluetooth has to ""reconnect"" or the speakers amp stays in a power save mode or whatever.

This really taints the experience, along with the other 'recently' experienced issues (like the newer devices selecting not to hear me when I'm standing right next to them, my gen2 dots are still LEAGUES ahead of any other newer device (Spot, Echo, Show...), listening-wise).

"I have an Amazon Echo. Although I like it as a device, I cannot really use it in my university halls of residence due to the Wi-Fi not having the correct type of security credentials (it's WPA Enterprise which means I can't just connect any old device onto it). I have tried creating a wireless bridge in my bedroom using an old desktop connected to my university network through Ethernet, and using a VPN, but the connection to the computer I was using as a hotspot got blocked and so is no longer an option.  That means the only other option is to configure it to connect to my mobile hotspot. This works fine, however, if I decide to turn the hotspot off for a while, and then back on, the Alexa doesn't pick it up automatically and I need to manually restart it if I want it to reconnect. Is there a way of configuring it so that this doesn't keep happening, and that the Alexa is connected online whenever my mobile hotspot is enabled?"

"I usually play the Question of the day skill/game everyday. This week, Alexa started saying at the end of the “round” something along the lines of “Thanks for playing. You can play again tomorrow by saying Alexa, play question of the day”. But it does not get past the word Alexa, since as it is saying that, it appears to invoke herself (as if I had said Alexa) and I have to say Dismiss for her to stop listening.

"Hello developers of Reddit,  I have a question how Tradfri Account Linking with Alexa works.

"I have the Echo Dot with clock, whenever I ask for the temperature she adds 10 degrees than the actual temperature... Is there any way to correct this?"
My SO is the one actually cheating but has dropped hints here and there about doing something to my echoes and home mini to listen in on me. I’m not afraid of what he hears because I’m not doing anything. I thought he was lying but has made remarks about things he wouldn’t have known unless he was listening in. I have noticed whenever we get into it or he is actively cheating my Alexa acts weird. If I ask for it to play something specific on YouTube via fire stick she says “hold on getting it from YouTube” twice then pulls up list of random stuff on other apps? Will rarely do the correct commands and more.    What could be really going on?   Lastly.. when you connect the fire stick to an non smart tv is it normal for a new device called smart tv for that tv pops up under devices? Saying connected via firestick?   I’d appreciate any help on this. It’s just very annoying since I mainly use Alexa for music or video playback and sometimes drop in for the baby room.
"I'm trying to find a way to create a conditional branching reminder, by turning an Alexa Reminder into a Routine, as follows:    *Instead* of ""At 10AM Ask: ""Mr Jones, did you take your meds today?""

I realize this could probably be done by creating a Skill but I don't feel I measure up yet to grasping that challenge and would like to see if I could do it as suggested above. (On the computer, I could probably have done it inside a relational database management program, but Alexa is a new challenge and I'm a lot older now!)

"Three adults living in the house. We bought an Amazon Echo Plus and 3 Echo Dots (one for each of our rooms). I've tried to find information about this online but it's confusing and doesn't really answer my questions so I'm hoping you guys could help.  We're used to Nest - there's one person who ""owns"" the home and they add more members (up to 10 I believe). Everyone who's been invited to the home can do the exact same things as the owner - change temperature, view the cameras, etc. I thought it would've been the same thing with Alexa so once my dad added the Echo Plus and my Echo Dot to the account, we tried to add my account to the household. After about an hour of troubleshooting and contacting support, I was added, but then we were informed that there can only be two adults on the household. We can't add my mam to it.  I figure I have an ignorant idea of how it works so I'm wondering:  * What functionality will we be missing out on by only having two of our accounts on the household instead of being able to connect all 3? * If any of you have a setup like ours (multiple Alexas in different bedrooms), can you give me a general idea of how it works with multiple people? * We all have separate Spotify accounts (they're grouped under a family plan but everyone's library is separate). Is there a way to connect my Echo Dot to my Spotify account only, my dad to connect his Echo Dot to his Spotify account only, etc.?  Thanks!"
I work shifts and would like a way to set multiple alarms at once on my Alexa device  For example if I said ‘set alarms for 7am shift ‘ Alexa would then set my alarm at 5am and 5.10 am  Is this possible ?
"I’ll explain the weird situation I’m going through. I got a Smart Life WiFi bulb that can be controlled through the app (Smart Life) without any issue. The problem is that my Alexa won’t find the device at all, so the native app finds the bulb but Alexa app doesn’t. It’s extremely odd that if I create some automations in the Smart Life app with the bulb, Alexa find them. So it recognizes sceneries but not the actual bulb as a device. Obviously I added the skill “Smart Life” for Alexa and tried everything: deleting and reinstalling the skill, using Tuya app instead of Smart Life, changing the country, rebooting router, powering off Alexa and the bulb, configuring the bulb time after time, etc. but nothing really helped. Have you guys got a solution?"
"Hi ,  today i thought that i should learn creating alexa custom skills and i learn and thought share the video so others can also learn.  [https://youtu.be/QsNN8jf-SnQ](https://youtu.be/QsNN8jf-SnQ)"
"Can anyone tell me how to ask Alexa to share something happy/positive in the news? I accidentally came across a way for Alexa to do it, but now I can't remember how I asked her. I tried adding the ""good news"" skill but that wasn't it. I also tried asking these questions:  ""Alexa, what's good in the news""  ""Alexa, tell me something positive that happened today""  and  ""Alexa, tell me happy news""  but those just prompted her to turn on CNN :(  HELP!  I'm tired of hearing about the Corona Virus, Politics and the Markets! I wanna hear about happy things like new baby pandas being born, scientists finding cures, and people helping other people!"
"Recently got a Smart LG tv and managed to get my Alexa working with it pretty much completely fine (can get it to turn on/off, volume change etc) however the only thing I can’t get it to do is launch apps. LG website says ‘Alexa, launch the ‘X’ app on tv’ but every time I use this command it says ‘I couldn’t find any enable video skills’. Anyone have a solution to this or know what skill I need?"
Today was Knute Rockne's birthday born in 1888 and apparently his first name is pronounced Kuh-newt not newt.
"I like having my Echo paired to my phone and using the voice command to use my Echo as a BT speaker.  It's been fine for several months, but recently it will randomly connect on it's own and start playing my audio on the Echo instead of from my phone.  When this happens I try to use the voice command to disconnect my phone but it always tells me that no devices are connected.  Is there a way to fix this issue?"
"Does anyone know how to get Alexa to play only your “liked” songs from a particular artist? I’ve tried everything I know how to say to get this to happen. For instance, I might say, “Play my liked songs by Enya.” Or “Play songs I like by Enya.”, and all I get is a Pandora station by the artist."
"I believe that Alexa or any similar AI will explode in popularity when using the above command brings a more er uhm... shall we say risque answer than the literal response we get now. Of course their needs to be some age filter or special security feature to ensure that only consenting adults have access to those special features. But I'm putting the cart in front of the horse...  &amp;#x200B;  What I'm about to say may be a bit radical but I'm serious. Stick with me for a few paragraphs -- then dismiss it if you like. ;)  I read a study a few years ago that concluded that back in the 70s and early 80's when VHS/Betamax was first introduced to consumers it was initially a niche thing for first adapters that didn't really have much penetration to the general public. It wasn't until videos with ratings above R became readily available that it had a quantum leap in popularity.  Put another way, when it became possible for Charlie the barber in Smallville Kansas to pop in a tape of Debbie's antics in Dallas in the comfort and privacy of his home after a long day cutting hair rather than driving 50 miles to some seedy peep show in Metropolis everything changed.   Charlie had to get one of those new fangled gadgets and you know what he could record tv with it too!  Family friendly models like mega giant Blockbuster video and others came later, after the market was well seeded and ripe for expansion, so to speak.  I postulate that the first mainstream AI to boldly venture into this area be it Alexa, Google, Siri or some other system will be the one that ultimately conquers all.   Thoughts?"
"When I look at my Alexa device list, I now see every device that has ever connected to my WiFi network: iPhones, MacBooks, etc. It used to only show Alexa-enabled, smart home devices, which is my desired behavior.  I think this was triggered by enabling eero’s HomeKit support, but I’m not 100% sure. Could be correlation instead of causation.  Has anyone else seen this/does anyone know how to fix besides manually “forgetting” each individual device?"
"For some reason, when I tell Alexa to play something (on amazon music) everywhere, it plays about the first 30 seconds of the song and then stops and maybe plays the next song on the playlist or just stops playing completely.  This has never been an issue before and just started a few days ago.  Any reason why?"
"#OK SNOOZING  Please tell me I can turn this off, it's infuriating!  Also on Show 8, I can touch it to snooze the first time, but after that I have to talk to it. Why can't I keep snoozing with touch?"
"How can undo my last command? I tried everything obvious that came to mind; didn't work. I sorely need this, especially when adding items to lists. Many times she mishears me, and sometimes I just add the wrong thing, or the right thing to the wrong list."
"I had my echo dot in my room since I got it, but was gifted a google home and decided to give my Dot to my mom. The device is now located in the room next to mine. Problem is that Alexa REFUSES to use my moms phone for Spotify, only mine. My mom does not have premium and I do; but I don’t think that matters. I deleted the Alexa app off my phone, forgot the device on both my phone and Spotify, and even deregistered the device from my Amazon account and switched it to my moms, and STILL when we ask her to play a song, it switches right back to Spotify on my phone. I have dug through settings on her phone and mine and I cannot figure out why she will only use my Spotify despite me trying to sever all ties. Can anyone help??"
It's so annoying.
"So I’ve registered my tv with lg ThinQ, and then followed the instructions on my tv to set up for Alexa. Which was a frustrating process. Now Alexa says it’s linked to the thinkq app on my phone but my echo can’t find the tv. I’ve tried everything and all I see in online searches I’ve done is people reporting issues with this, yet some people get it to work just fine. Any answers or tips here? I have a 50” webOS LG and I’m super frustrated. I’ve need going through different routes for the last three hours and nothing works. I’m pissed because the th said it was compatible but it’s anything but..."
"Well, I’m at a loss. I’ve googled this extensively and nothing I’ve tried has worked. I’ve had plusminus smart bulbs set up with Alexa for months with no trouble at all. They stopped working after our power went out but I managed to reset them. They’re working absolutely fine in the plus minus app, and they’re connected in the Alexa app and I can control them through the Alexa app too, but she’s not responding to any voice commands- she just says “sorry, bedroom/living room does not support that.”   Would really appreciate any help! I’ve already tried unlearning/relearning the skill, disconnecting and reconnecting to the account, deleting the groups, etc. At a loss."
"heres what I want to do  I want to say ""Alexa, it's business time""  and my studio and adjacent bar turns on (no proble, got that)  AND  I want a snippet of the song ""it's business time"" to play. I have it as an mp3.  Whats the easiest way?"
"Hi...  I was wondering if I create a routing where someone could ask ""Where am I?"" And, dependent on which Alexa / Echo they were asking it would give a different response eg ""You're in the kitchen"" or You're in the bedroom"""
"Hi,   Just wondering if anyone has encountered a similar problem to the one I'm having.  We have a number of Echos around the house, a mixture of gen 2 and 3 dots and a full size.  I had setup a couple of groups, one for controlling lounge lights and one for my Denon Networked music system. All was working fine until about a week for switching and dimming the lights and controlling the music system then all of a sudden one of the Echos didn't recognise the groups, but can still control the individual items. The other Echos seem to still be fine but for some reason one doesn't. No changes had been made to the setup in the house.  I've tried a factory reset, deleting and recreating the groups and have had no success.   Anyone else had any similar issues and any ideas?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks"
"We have a bunch of echoes throughout the house and would like to use as baby monitor.  But the only solution I see is to “drop in”, which has the disadvantage of blocking your echo all the time the baby’s sleeping (i.e., leave it on drop in, can’t Spotify, can’t do anything).    Is there anything “smarter” that’d “call” the echo when the baby starts crying?  I could get a separate one just for monitoring, but this drop in solution seems so clunky that I assume there’s a better option.  Thanks!"
"I deleted the bulb on the hue bluetooth app, then tried again but no luck.   I seen how some posts say to reset the bulb with serial code but the option is now missing from the Alexa app.   I tried the hue app and Alexa on iOS and had no luck.   I reset the bulb using the option too as well as delete the bulb and reconnected, renamed it. Nothing seems to work.   I can control the bulb with the app but Alexa (echo dot) can't find it.   Please can someone help."
"I have a routine with play music action (Adele from Amazon Music). Within the play music action, I set duration to 5 seconds. When I invoke the routine, the music plays forever.  I tried to add a wait action after the play music action, but Alexa says play music must be the last action in a routine. How can I get music to stop playing in a routine??"
After I moved my echo to a different room it has decided to start making announcements when I receive texts or phone calls on my iPhone. I have looked through all the menus in the Alexa app but can’t find any option that deals with this. All google searches lead to instructions about how to setup calling and messaging on Alexa. I just want it to stop announcing when I get a phone call or text! Please help!
"My Alexa app has an old/incorrect amazon music account linked to it.  I’m looking for how to delink it with an operable/active amazon music account.

"Is it just me? Whenever I try to add alarm, routine or change wifi setting on Alexa app it lags. Like freezes the entire screen and app becomes unusable . I'm using htc u11 running Android 9. Does any one else have the same issue."
"Does anyone remember the episode of Married with Children where Kelly gets on a game show so she is studying and learns a bunch of new information.  It turns out her brain only holds so much information and she forgets things she used to know.  I feel like Alexa is just like that.  The more they try to make it do, the less it does well and it forgets stuff that it used to know.   It's getting so frustrating to get it to do the simple stuff."
All of our alarms were reset this morning.
"Every time Alexa connects to my laptop via bluetooth, she says ""now playing from Desktop .. and then she spits out a bunch of numbers.   Anyone know how to change the name so that Alexa says something short and sweet? ... I went to my settings and changed the name of my laptop but Alexa doesn't recognize it for some reason??  I've rebooted her and the old laptop name is still used.  Would appreciate any suggestions.  Thanks!"
" For years, I have been putting tasks on Todoist through Alexa by saying, ""Alexa, put cream cheese on the to do list"" and she responds, ""Cream cheese added to your to do list."" Then when I open Todoist on any of my 5 devices, there is ""cream cheese"" on today's task. A few days ago, this stopped working. Alexa still responds as I stated, but instead of going on my Todoist list, the item goes on Alexa's to do list that can be accessed through the Alexa app. I spoke with Amazon and they said they have a ticket opened on it, but is anyone else experiencing this and is there a fix? Thanks so much!"
"So, I have had my whole home Alexa setup for about a year and she was great at first but now she is deaf, doesn't respond correctly most of the time and is very frustrating to work with.   So has anyone made the switch either to Google home or were you previously a Google home user and swapped to alexa and if so why."
My wife’s birthday is coming up and we are having friends over for dinner party. Halfway through I am surprising everyone with a murder mystery. I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for using Alexa for Sound effects.... I would to have a gun shot sound and  thunder clapping. I will probably set these up at specific times.
"Current TV is crapping out. That's ok, I'm kinda excited to get something new, but haven't been paying attention the last few years. Have smart TVs gotten better? This:  Samsung 75"" TU8000 Crystal UHD 4K UHD Smart TV with Alexa Built-in UN75TU8000FXZA 2020 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084JBN6W9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_Ub0wEbXZ9DVJ7  just released today. Description proudly says ""Amazon certified Alexa built-in"". Does that mean it has actual Fire TV capabilities? Or should I just ignore all the various TVs ""smartness"" and look for something with the best display for the cheapest, and plug a fire TV device in the back?  Thanks."
I use notifications primarily for any packages that are delivered. Today I got a notification asking if I wanted to review a product I ordered weeks ago.. WTH?
It dosent happen super often just enough to be annoying. Any idea what is going on and how to stop it?
Anyone else? It's mildly annoying. And one of the only missing things on Apple TV is a good voice assistant with Spotify support.
So a little backstory. I have an Amazon echo dot and it is hooked up to my mothers amazon account. I have heard that you can hook up an Alexa to a Spotify account and I would like to know how to.
"Please pardon my ignorance - my very early foray into smart home and security.   Is there a record audio setting in Alexa that can be retrieved in case of burglary?  Scenario: If home has had a burglary, there could be audio recording that can be retrieved from Alexa."
I cannot find solutions online beyond 2017. I have tried all the solutions I can find and echo still cannot find my playlists. Live support's solution is to delete and recreate them but that really isn't feasible as it would take forever and I'd probably wanna shoot myself if it still didn't work
So I have the nest thermostat and Philips Hue in my living room and I say hey Alexa set a living room light to 80%.     She says please try again using percent for brightness and degrees for temperature .     But that is what I’m saying but she just keeps repeating it to me
When I’m trying to tell her this morning to tune to one of my usual channels like Road trip radio or lithium she was putting it on different channels like the Bridge or Ozzy’s boneyard. So it’s not like she wasn’t getting the commands she just kept trying to confirm the wrong channel.  Anyone else getting this strange behavior this morning? It usually works like a charm.
"So I know that playing music, sound or whatever can only come as the last item of a routine.  I've solved this for scheduled routines, by simply starting two routines at the same time, one to play the radio station, and the other to do all the other stuff over the next hour.  But how do I solve it for routines that are started from, for example, a voice command? I can only think of insane ideas like: routine A switches on a fan heater that heats up the Echo+ and triggers a temperature-dependent routine B.   Alternatively, can you have multiple routines triggered from the same Echo button?  And if so, can you use an IKEA Tradfri dimmer switch instead of an Echo button?"
"A few days after I put my Echo Show 5 in my room, I found the WONDERFUL ""Alexa, turn the display off"" feature which turned the screen totally off until I spoke to her again. This feature worked without issue for two and a half months.  Unfortunately, after a recent wind storm which knocked the power out five times in one day--yes, I'm not kidding--the Echo Show has been...""waking up"" randomly, which is especially easy-to-notice at night. When I'm trying to sleep. In the dark.  It's as if she's randomly hearing someone say ""Alexa"" because I can occasionally catch the purple bar at the bottom of the screen appear. I'm not sure what I can do at this point and I'm afraid static has fouled the microphone or something, but my next course of action may be to factory reset and see if that clears her ""mind"" or something. If I factory reset, I still have all my routines set up through the Alexa app, correct? So I won't be losing any of that (I hope)?"
"Here I don’t mean “cast” as in chromecast, but cast as in having your works-with-Alexa speaker take over playback from your phone.   This is one thing I find the most significant shortcoming with works-with-Alexa speakers.  With works-with-Google home speakers, you can cast music or podcast. With AirPlay2-ready speakers, you can similarly cast music or podcast.  But with works-with-Alexa speakers, you don’t have that flexibility. Some apps - like Spotify - will be able to see all speakers on the wifi and cast playback to one of them. But some apps - like my podcast app - cannot see work-with-Alexa speakers, while even these apps still can chromecast or connect with AirPlay2-ready speakers.  What’s alexa’s equivalent to casting? None?"
   Is it possible to connect 2 devices to play to a receiver via Bluetooth? I have a samsung refrigerator with tablet built in and an amazon echo. I want to be able to listen to music from both of them with out having to disconnect one or the other is it possible?
I used to be able to swipe backwards to bring up a news story (or screen) that just passed that I wasn't able to get to in time to watch. Now it's just random stories in no particular order and I can't find what I'm looking for. A friend said hers does the same thing too. Does any of yours do this now?
"I just set up an amazon dot, and I would like to play music. I set the app up in my normal email, but my amazon music account is shared with my mom and has all my music on there. Is there anyway to change what amazon music account alexa is connected to?"
"I ask for this song and it lights up, beeps, and deactivates. It's like it is ignoring me and judging me for my taste in music. Why is this happening?"
"I installed a bunch of smart lights and grouped them together in Smart Life.  This works fine, and controls them all just fine.  When I go to Alexa, the group is broken.  About half of the lights are in the ""Downstairs Lights"" group, and then the rest are splintered off.  I've disabled the Smart Life skill in Alexa and re-enabled it to no avail.  Alexa sees them, just not all in the same group.  Is there a way I can manually add them into the group (or fix this in general)?"
"Hello, I hope i am right here.  I recently bought a Philips Hue Bluetooth light bulb and I installed the Philips Hue Bluetooth App on Android. It works fine there so I connected it to my Echo Dot 3 via the Philips Hue Bluetooth App ""Alexa, discover my gadgets"". Turning it on / off via Alexa works fine, however I cannot find it in my Alexa App... I tried to search for new Bluetooth Gadgets, etc. but I cant find it.  The problem is, now I cant rename it, unconnect it or group it. I cant even see its connected on the Philips Hue Bluetooth App.. Anyone has a Idea how to fix this? Did I do something wrong?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks in advance!"
"This morning I woke up and asked alexa to play my favorite album (Honeymoon by Lana Del Rey). Alexa responded with ""To play a specific album you'll need to sign up for Amazon music unlimited which lets you choose from over 50 million songs on this Echo it's free for 30 days and then you'll be automatically charged $3.99 a month, cancel anytime. Terms in the Alexa app. Should I sign you up and play the album Honeymoon."" I, a non-employed highschool student said: ""no"" I think I took what Alexa replied a bit offensively because of her emphasis on the word ""free"". Her response was ""I can play similar music on  stations for *free*"",""Here is a station based on the album; Honeymoon."" This is new, Alex used to play all of the music that wasn't ""premium"" which required the subscription. Now I'm just resorting to not use my phone by connect her via Bluetooth and play my album from YouTube. Sorry for the rant but I needed it."
"Alexa is so darn frustrating sometimes!   She's like a polite but feeble minded dottard that seemingly wants to assist you but lacks the competence to do anything beyond the simplest of tasks.  When I invested in this technology I had dreams of something closer to the movie ""Her"" but it's been more like the ""Joker"" with me left wearing the clown makeup."
"There are two fish in a tank, one says to the other how do you drive this thing?)"
"I'm on the verge of selling these devices, they are slow and the software is shit. The only thing that works reliably is turning lights off and on. By far the most annoying thing it does is when I ask to play a song or one of my playlists, it can be one that I literally just played and half the time it autoplays some terrible radio station instead. Does anyone on the planet actually like that? Why in the F would you program it to do that? Seriously rage inspiring."
"This is becoming a real frustration for me. Spotify on an Echo device doesn't always play what I want, or at all. Latest niggle is, 'Alexa, play Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds on spotify', which cannot be found &gt;:-&lt;   Does seem to play what I want on my Google Hub though, so this must be an Echo issue right?"
"I was looking through IFTTT and couldn't figure out a way to configure Alexa this way;  If I leave the house, then turn on Alexa Guard Mode.  Is this possible through some other means, or at all? Thanks for reading!"
Ideally I could say “Alexa start routine”  * Alexa activates whisper mode  * Alexa turns off the lights   * Alexa says a few things    But any routine I make I can’t seem to get her in whisper mode. Is there any way to do this??
"I bought 3 Echos a couple of weeks ago. One for each kids’ room and one for the living room. Up until this morning , we could all listen to different prime music on each device. Tonight when one kid was listening to something, the other asked Alexa to play something different. We got some weird message saying music was already streaming to another device and do we want to cancel that one and stream here. Oh this is going to cause a war between the kids. How do I fix this?"
"So, I bought a VIZIO SmartCast TV and was wondering if I can use my Alexa as a speaker for the TVs audio?"
"Recently, when I ask her to play a song, 9 out of 10 times she plays a station based on songs like that one instead. Did Amazon remove a bunch of their music? These are all songs I’ve had Alexa play plenty of times before."
I realized Alexa could help me overcome my laziness when it comes to journalling. I'd like to be able to come home at night and just tell Alexa what happened that day and have her record it for me.   Any skills like that?
"I started having issues with Alexa loading. The screen comes up, but the ability to press anything and do anything lags behind a SOLID minute. So I tried deleting the app and reinstalling, which is annoying because I have to re add Echo Auto .... I was so flustered that I actually FACTORY RESET MY PHONE over this. That didnt help, and in top of it not helping my routines are not behaving correctly.  Some actions in the routine happen and some dont. And routines triggered by location dont work AT ALL. I feel like I have gone above and beyond what should have to be done and I have a LOT of money and my time invested in the Amazon/ Echo/Alexa environment. What do I do now? I am pretty tech savvy and I am at my wits end here."
"My mother in law is having trouble with her Alexa devices in her home. She has a 3rd generation echo dot, amazon echo 3rd gen, a first-gen Alexa, and a new subwoofer from amazon. They are all in a group together named everywhere. She normally just has to tell Alexa to play ""x"" songs everywhere and it does. Recently it has stopped working and she has to first go into her amazon music app and then send it to the group. I've tried to do some troubleshooting but haven't figured anything out yet. The devices all say they are online on the Alexa app. Any help, ideas, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!"
"So I'm watching The Office S3E7 ""Branch Closing"" in Media Player Classic off to the side of my screen while I have Chrome open and doing some web browsing. About 10 mins into the episode I go to Facebook. One of the sponsored ads is Comedy Central saying ""The Office Is On Now"" promoting obviously that The Office is now airing on CC at the moment. They include a clip...and its a clip of the exact episode I'm watching out of my personal ripped collection.  So was it just complete coincidence that out of the 201 Office episodes avaiable, FB just happen to promote the show with the exact episode I was watching or is there something else going on? Like Alexa hearing it and catering my FB ads to me or my PC reporting what I'm watching?"
"my switch in my kitchen has worked great for a very long time.  I can go into the alexa app see the kitchen light switch and turn the kitchen light off an on just fine with the button.  Alexa can still turn other devices off and on, but any voice command gets the same ""kitchen doesn't support that"".    This device is connected via smart things, and both the alexa app and the smart things app allow me to turn it off and on inside the app."
"My sister in Canada got different answers to me in the U.K., but her response was pretty witty."

"So my lights stopped responding today. I have 2 newish Phillips hue bulbs (previously had a eufy bulb that was buggy by design). I deleted both devices and the group and remade both. One light was fixed, but every time I rediscover the new Phillips hue bulb, it discovers it as the old eufy bulb. Just to be clear, my old eufy bulb is unplugged on my desk. I have no idea how this is happening and how to get around it. I think it might have something to do with the fact that my old eufy bulb was named “lamp”, and after I retired it, I named my new bulb “lamp”. But I’ve gone through the deletion process several times now with no success. Has anyone else experienced anything like thIs?"
"MLB Gameday audio didn't work for all of 2019 which was ridiculous. I tried it the other day, maybe the second day of Spring Training, and it worked. Can anyone else confirm it works for them to and I wasn't dreaming?"
"I have several routines set up on my 3rd gen Echo Dot that includes turning lights on/off and then Alexa doing another skill (flash briefing or opening sleep sounds). Up until yesterday I would say “Alexa goodnight” and my lamps would go off and she would open sleep sounds. Now when I say it, the lights just turn off and that’s it. I’ve tried deleting and then recreating the routine and I’ve unplugged then plugged the dot back in. Any other suggestions? I didn’t realize how much I liked my routines until now"
"I was taking a nap.  There was no one in the home.  Suddenly Alexa Show starts playing ""We Will Rock You"" By Queen.  Now, I like the song but it freaked me out a bit.  Just so you know the only other people who live in my house are my 7 year old and my 8 year old neither of which were home and both of which have no idea how to use the dang thing other than to arm Photon torpedoes.  Any thoughts?"
"Anyone else have this?  I'll be in my account and say ""Switch to \*my\* account"" (instead of asking which I'm in, then switch if it's not mine) and rather than Alexa say ""you're already in your account"" or even ""now in \*your\* account"" despite not switching at all, it just toggles the account.  I find this bloody annoying, surely it shold not do the switch and either pretend like it did and say ""now in \*your\* account"" or inform me I'm already there.  &amp;#x200B;  At least that's my expected behaviour, can anyone confirm this is the case?"
"This isn't a huge deal, but it's a bit annoying and I'm hoping someone here can help me out. If I initiate I routine that is supposed to play an alexa saying followed by music or just music, it will play the alexa voice through the correct echo, but then the music plays through whichever echo is actively playing music vs. playing through the routine's assigned echo. If none of the echos are active the routine works as intended.   Example: I have an ""I'm home"" routine for my kitchen echo where Alexa tells me a joke and then plays a radio station through tunein on the kitchen echo. If for some reason there's another echo currently playing music (sometimes I leave music on for my dog) the tunein radio portion of the routine will automatically route to the active speaker instead of the kitchen speaker.  I do not have any speakers in a larger group and none are set as my preferred speakers. I have reset all echos with no luck.  Thanks ahead of time."
so I told Alexa a cool code then I accidentally messed it up and it said Alexa classic mode any tips on how to turn it back cause its an echo dot kids edition please help me
"I just saw the ""Day 1"" edition of [Alexa-in-a-ring](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JPK4XJ6/).     Many, many LOTR jokes here."
My echo show 5 has news stories that go by the screen and I used to be able to swipe backwards to listen/read one that I couldn't get to fast enough (missed tapping on it by a second or two before it went to the next story). Now when I miss a news story and swipe backwards it can't be found. Has anyone else noticed this change?

Why does the volume slider keep sticking?  In the currently playing bottom bar the slider adjustment jumps around. In the device settings with % shown it also “sticks.”
"How in the hell do I play Fasta by Kah-lo?!  Each time I ask, she either plays something by some Carlos or just doesn't play anything at all. I spelled out fasta for her and she played Fasta by some arbitrary name like Abvh something."
"Hey there! So I use 4 total Alexas, 2 of which are connected just fine to their lights - the Light on and off commands work fine. One of the rooms, however, always tells me that a few things share the name ""light"". Why?  They're set up the exact same way. The light is identical to the one used in the Living Room, but refuses to work the same way. Whaaaat's the deaaaaal?"
"I ask because often times Alexa plays the wrong thing, but I'd like to search in my phone in the Alexa app.  Is that possible?"
"All I have a Aladdin Genie Connect set up in my Garage. I also have Lutron controlling lights and Alexa serving as the backbone for my home automation.   Does anyone have any luck Connect the Aladdin in Amazon or IFTTT. What I’d like to accomplish is when the garage door opens, the garage lights or turned on by Lutron and when the garage door closes the light turns off."
"I got my first Echo 2-3 years ago.  It was limited in what it could do but it got things right most of the time.  I feel like now the goal is to have *some* answer, rather than the right answer.  And there are tasks that it just seems to struggle with that are fairly simple.  Example:  I have a Vizio TV (named ""Vizio TV"") and I use the PlutoTV app a lot.  If I say ""Alexa, open PlutoTV on Vizio TV."" I may get a response saying there are several skills that could work, or it may say it doesn't understand, or it may launch it and say ""Getting PlutoTV on Vizio Smartcast.""  OK, fine... So next time I say ""Open PlutoTV on Vizio Smartcast"" and it has no idea WTF I'm talking about again.  Hue Lights are another struggle for Alexa.  I'll have to repeat myself several times and sometimes she just plain ignores me.  Also, she'll answer a question just because the response has ONE single word that matches what I asked, usually prefaced by, ""According to another Amazon customer.""  Is there a way I can turn that feature off?  Because I could not care less about the opinion of another Amazon customer when I'm trying to get the answer to a question.  Finally, she's going deaf.  I'll be standing 1' from my Echo downstairs and talk in normal voice and the one on the 2nd floor in my bedroom will respond?  How TF do you confuse the location on these two.  In short.  I have several Echos and I am starting to hate them.  It's getting to the point where they are more of a frustration than helpful."
I just discovered that there's no way to do an action in a routine if Guard detects something wrong. Seems like sort of an oversight? Am I missing something obvious?
"**Question 1:**  I have an Echo and an [Amazon Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01NAXS22M), which I use to turn a lamp on and off.  My wifi isn't the best and sometimes it can drop out unexpectedly. After a few minutes of no connection, my 'smart' plug decides to turn my lamp off.   I find this incredibly stupid behaviour. Is there any way to change it so I don't get plunged into darkness just because my plug can't get online?  (I ask because I'd like to use the plug to control my fridge, and I don't want to come home one day to discover my fridge has defrosted because my internet went out.)  **Question 2:**  I really want to be able to ask Alexa to *""Turn my light off in 2 hours""*, which seems like it should be a simple enough request, but apparently not. Is there any easy way to make this work?   (Note: I want to be able to ask it to turn *off or on* and for *any* amount of time, not just 2 hours.)"

"Just as the title says... the other day it was doing it with music on Amazon Prime. Now it’s doing it when I’m streaming a radio station. It’s driving me crazy! It is doing it on every Alexa, when I play things on groups, etc."
"Hello!  I have an SD card in my phone with like 75 gigs of my own music on it, lots of which is not available on amazon music. But it's all loaded into amazon music in my ""offline music"" folder. I want to be able to ask Alexa to play this stuff in my truck, but I can't get it to completely work. It will only play stuff available on amazon music. And I cant tell if its playing a streaming version, or my downloaded version.   For example:  If I ask her to ""play the album (insert name here) FROM MY LIBRARY"" she says ""playing YOUR album"".  If I ask her to play the same album ""FROM MY OFFLINE LIBRARY"", she wont play it.  If I ask her to play an album that isnt available on amazon music ""FROM MY LIBRARY"" she wont play it.   She will only play stuff available on Amazon music, so I'm pretty sure if i ask her to play something from my library, it's still streaming it and not playing the offline version.   Is there any way to do this? I have limited data on my phone, and I can't be streaming music for multiple hours a day. Nor can I play the other stuff not available on amazon without pressing buttons on my phone (I dont wanna do this while driving).  Thanks!"

"TLDR; Add routine folders for more complex households  So I might be late to the game but I remember in summer of last year there wasn’t a way to name your routines. Being a organization freak; that killed me inside. So I set the best routines I could and they’ve been on autopilot since.   Fast forward to today when I picked up a few more smart plugs and switches that I’ve been waiting to grab and I go to open the Alexa app-BOOM!-I can name my routines. I’m so happy, thank you so much.   Along with this praise, I do have one suggestion: is there any way we could have routine folders? Or the ability to rearrange the list of routines so I can keep certain ones together so that I can mentally organize my household better?   I know that there’s a workaround of recreating the routine so it appears at the top of the list, and to that I reply: “mom’s spaghetti”."
"Hello Reddit,  I've been googling/shopping on amazon.ca without finding what I'm looking for.  I'm actually not sure there is such thing out there...  I'm looking to replace the paper calendar we have in the kitchen with a ""digital"" calendar where we could have the family schedule on.  The biggest problem I foresee are all our requirements:  -I use Exchange for emails -My wife is on G-Suite -We use Alexa in the house and it would be great to be able to add stuff verbally to the calendar. -Finally, for this to be a success, it would be great if we could display pictures of our choice on the calendar.  Is there anything out there that would cover these?"

I just set up my Amazon show five and for the Clock selected the picture slideshow option using pictures that are already in my Amazon account and that show on my fire stick as a screensaver. It shows one picture and then it kind of blinks and goes to the ask Alexa suggestions and then it’ll do another picture. It’s not smooth as if it’s alternating between an Alexa picture and one of my photos it really glitches and blinks after my photo as if the two screensaver options are fighting each other. Has anyone else encountered this?
Got any ideas on how i could use it more? I have Prime if you want to know.
I'm kind of confused why Drop In capability isn't available for non-cellular devices but I tried to make it work with Repeat After Me without great success. Don't know why Alexa sometimes responds to what I said instead of repeating after me and why sometimes can't process what I've said at all. Also seems to not consistently go through the Echo Dot it's connected to so I'm just talking to my device like an idiot... We have one Google Mini and one Echo Dot so ideally they'd work together...??
"Am I missing something or is there a product missing from the market that should exist. My electric shower broke in my en-suite so I thought great, I can buy a shower that I (or my 2 young kids) can turn on with a command to Alexa rather than having to quickly press a button and get out of the way before you get a blast of cold water to the face.  Problem is that they don't seem to exist, at least in the UK. I can't be the only one out there that sees this as a problem. Millions of people have cold water fed electric showers. Many of them must have to wait a minute for it to warm up or have that same 'dodge the cold blast of water' thing that I have to do.  Anyone got any recommendations if I am missing the obvious product already on the market that I should be buying?"

"So I've this playlist of songs I like going to sleep to and made a simple routine to set the volume, start the playlist and to end it in 30 minutes (usually all it takes).  What I would like is to have Alexa shuffle the list first so I'm not always hearing the same songs in the same order, each time.  Now, I can wait for the first song to start, tell her to shuffle then skip but I'm looking to make this more automated, is there any trick to making this happen?   Thanks"
"I have a fire tablet 8 and the show mode dock set up in my front room. I did this primarily so I could drop in on my pets and see what they were up to while I'm at work.     However its proving to be rather problematic because despite the fact that I disabled the ""handsfree alexa"" option, it still responds when I try and talk to one of my other speakers and there is no way to add it to a group and set a different speaker as primary like you can with multiple echos.  &amp;#x200B;  I have tried disabling the microphone with the little crossed out circle, and that works great except for the fact that also disables the camera so I can no longer drop in and check on the pets.  Can someone help me understand how to get this working properly?"

"I have an Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 5 in a multi-room music group in the Alexa app. When I say Alexa play music on multi-room music group, it disconnects the Bluetooth speaker (a high end stereo system) from the Echo Show 5 and plays music out of the crappy built-in speakers on the Echo Show instead. When I say to play music only on the Echo Show 5, it immediately reconnects to the Bluetooth speaker and plays out of that. WTF is going on here? Does this have to do with Amazon skirting around Sonos patents?"
"Hi.  My question is connected with  Shelly (Shelly smart home relays), Alexa Virtual Buttons skill, IFTT and webhooks.     Shelly app can send you email (only to address from which you are logged in account), when scene (inside their app) is done.    So what I want is to FW that mail to IFTT service and to use webhooks for trigger Alexa routine via Virtual buttons.   Actually all works fine until I want to automatic FW incoming mail from Shelly over **Gmail** to [trigger@applet.ifttt.com](mailto:trigger@applet.ifttt.com).      Gmail requires confirmation code sent to mail address where you FW mails and of course I don't have access to  [trigger@applet.ifttt.com](mailto:trigger@applet.ifttt.com) to read conf. code. :)     I know this is not Virtual Buttons problem, but maybe you have some experiences with this kind of problem?"

John F Kennedy  Marilyn Monroe  Elvis Presley  Spiderman  Atticus Finch   David Duke  George Bush  Scott Pilgrim  Try a bunch.  Anybody you like.  Get a feel for how Alexa answers things.

"I have a Echo Show in the kitchen, and in the bedroom. I use a flex in my hallway as a light sensor, and I have the tall Echo speakers, one in the living room, one in the second bedroom. Safe to say I am saturated by Alexa in my apartment.  Question is, is it worth picking up a Google Home too (the one with the screen)? Is there any benefit to using both?

"I’ve started switching my house over to Hue bulbs and am trying to figure out if this is possible. I feel like there has to be a way.   I would like to set the default for light bulbs in certain zones based on the time of day. For instance, if I turn my bathroom light on at 7am, I want it to be at 80% daylight. But if I turn it on at 2am, I want it to be at 40% warm. I know I can adjust it on the fly but I would really like to just have it set so it’s automatic based on time of the day. As in, between 10pm-6am, set to 40% warm, 6am-10pm 80% daylight, etc.   Any ideas? I’ve tried looking through Alexa routines and don’t see anything that specific.

"On a Google smart speaker  "" Play &lt;a podcast name&gt; episode &lt;whatever episode number you want&gt;""  Works like a charm.  On an Echo device, the same command results in you either getting the most recent episode, or the usual 'hmm'.   I prefer the Alexa hardware, but damn the software side of it seems to have been stagnant for a long time. Simple commands with basic modifiers like episode numbers, or dates, and it just chokes."
"Ok so I know the second request has definitely been made before, but I want to take it a step further: I would also like to be able to incorporate a “mute mic” feature into a routine.   Background: One of the biggest concerns that I’ve heard from house guests when my relatives come over is “the government is listening” type stuff.  To make these guests feel more at ease, I wish I could be able to tell Alexa to trigger a routine that shuts off some or all microphones in my home (obviously this would require some ifttt integration).  The routine would look something like this:  “Alexa, activate the cone of silence”  Routine: 1. turns of microphones on all Alexa devices (either in that room, or in the whole home) 2. Through ifttt: Turns off all security cameras INSIDE the room/house 3. (Anything else that you may want to include, maybe like closing the blinds, turning on a sound machine, or something else, depending on your needs)  Then, so I don’t have to go around turning every device back on, it would be nice if I could include turning on these microphones/devices with routine, so that I only have to manually turn on the microphone on one Alexa device, and then I could use a routine to turn on all the others, as well as other cameras, etc.  Extra: I also have a couple of other ideas of things that would be cool to incorporate, though they require a bit more effort to set up, such as turning off all microphones on smartphones associated with account, turning off microphones on any specified computers (which, in my case, almost definitely requires some work in Automator on Mac), and maybe even sending a message to any visitors in the house that are on the WiFi network, telling them how to turn the mics off on their phones (mostly because I know this would annoy my dad when he comes over... but that’s a story for another time).  Tl;dr: I want to be able to say something like “Alexa, go off the grid” or “Alexa, activate their cone of silence” to trigger an Alexa routine that shuts off all home monitoring devices"

"I’m looking for a smart dimmer remote pretty much like the Philips Hue dimmer remote, but that can work on any smart bulb and doesn’t have to be hard wired into the wall.  The idea is to use it on a bedside table, so hard wiring is out. Currently we have one of those long wired slidable dimmers that the lamp is plugged into, but I’d like to be able to use Alexa during the day to turn it on and change brightness and possibly color, then use the dimmer remote for early morning quiet.  Last resort would be to shell out $50 for a pair of the Hue dimmers and $100 for color Hue bulbs."
"Before Alexa can truly be an effective automation program, it really needs a handful of crucial features. Namely, the ability to call on other routines as part of a routine, and the ability to add AND and OR operators to routine triggers. Like when ""front door opens"" AND ""time is between 7 and 8am"" or when ""front door opens"" OR ""motion sensor detects movement"". And then be able to trigger other premade routines as actions in a routine. Like if I have a routine that has ""All lights on, heat on, say the weather, then play a podcast"", I shouldn't have to add all those actions to multiple separate routines if I want them to be triggered by different things.   Does Amazon publish any kind of plans or intentions about what they intend on adding later? Is there any hope in the future such things will be added, or do we just have to wait it out and hope."
"Anyone with a Q85R tell me how well the smart things skill works with Alexa. What voice commands can you use, is it well developed or do you just use the voice remote?"
"Are questions added in by the dev team or something?

"Hello,   I am new to all of this and I know these questions probably get annoying but I cannot find an answer anywhere. I recently got an Echo Dot, Amazon fire stick, Echo Show 10 along with 4 smart plugs as a gift. I have been able to somewhat set everything up but with all of those devices I thought I would be able to turn my tv on and off with my voice. I can turn it off with my voice but not on. Also the only way I have been able to control the tv with my voice is through the amazon remote such as ""Alexa play the office on hulu"" but my goal is to not have to use the remote at all.    I read somewhere I need a hub like the Logitech Harmony in order to make this work but I was under the impression the new echo show 10 was a hub..?   Can anyone explain this in simple terms..?   #"

"Considering the ratings and reviews on Amazon, none of the Alexa-compatible LED ceiling lights look very attractive. So I'm thinking about getting a higher-rated ""non-Alexa"" LED ceiling light that has a remote control and pairing it with an RF hub like SwitchBot or Broadlink.    Price-wise they come out to roughly the same. But with the RF light + hub I can get a trusted quality NEC light with a 5-year warranty, rather than some no-name light dropshipped from Alibaba.    HOWEVER, the ratings/reviews of the RF hubs are pretty much the same as those for the Alexa-compatible lights.    Any experience/advice/feedback with these setups?"

"I have a couple of Amazon Taps that I have been using daily for several years. Over the past month or so, I've noticed a problem when using voice commands to control a bluetooth connected iPhone. Normally, I've had no problems saying ""Alexa skip"" to skip to the next song or 30 seconds ahead in a podcast when using Overcast. Now, when I tell Alexa to skip, it disconnects the phone from Bluetooth and begins playing the last thing that was streaming on the Tap. However, the buttons on top of the device skip forward and back as expected.  Anyone else seen this problem or have any solutions to try? I've already reset the Bluetooth connection. Also, the voice based skip command works fine on my regular Echo."

So i bought wyze cameras a while back and then got an echo dot from my mom. I then got an ecovac on black friday. It only runs on 2.4 GHz but after i set it up my wyze cameras went down but i think i just set them up again and it was fine. Over the last few days i got 2 more dots my mom never set up and a 4 pack of Peteme LED light bulbs (also only run on 2.4GHz) and now i cant get the cams and lights to work at the same time. The cams only work if the 2.4 and 5 are combined and the lights only work if they're separate. Anyone know how i can fix this??

"Many of you probably already know about this but I had a slight revelation today.  My family enjoys the Alexa ecosystem and we have many dots throughout the house.  During the course of a week or so, the volumes on all of these devices used to be all over the place from random music playing or whatever.    So at some points I’d be like, “Alexa, what’s the weather today.”  And she would reply, “^(The weather today is...)”  And then on a different echo, “(#) THE WEATHER...”    You get the point.  So now I have a routine per echo to reset the volume of that particular echo each night.  So problem solved?!  NO!  I wanted to be able, at will, to just say one command that would reset all the volumes on every echo in the house whenever I felt like it and not wait on a schedule.  Over the last year I’ve become proficient at SmartThings Virtual Devices and it occurred to me I can create a routine that will be a trigger for another routine (or as many routines as I want) using a virtual device that Alexa recognizes as a sensor which can be a trigger for routines.  That’s a bit convoluted so I’ll map it out as simply as I can.  1.  Master routine &gt; Action: Turn on SmartThings Virtual Device   2.  Secondary routine (or as many routines as I want) triggered by SmartThings Virtual Device  And there ya go.  One routine to trigger another or many routines.  The upshot of this is I can now say a phrase to trigger the master routine which will in turn trigger the secondary routines simultaneously executing many many commands, in this case, setting the volume of every individual echo to whatever I want.  Obviously for my use case it’s nice for volume, but many of you want multiple routines to be triggered with one command?  Now with IFTTT being both a trigger or action, the options are really limitless.  Apologies if you already knew that, but maybe someone out there wants to know how to make a simple virtual device which acts as an Alexa trigger.    Ciao"
"I'm interested in getting a smart plug that I can use outside my house, but the Amazon-provided model doesn't support outdoor use. There are third-party outdoor models, but I'm concerned about the security of third-party app providers, and to whom I would need to give my Amazon login data to pair the plugs to my Alexa. Is there any third party plug which is directly compatible with the Alexa mobile app, or is there some other way I can do the pairing myself.

I don’t even know so weird, then the guy not auditioning would come back on the line and apologize and start asking whoever he thinks he was talking to questions... it sounded like I was somehow brought into another phone conversation.

"This morning I asked my Echo Dot to change the temperature in my Dining Room.  I replied it couldn’t do that, even though it had done it on previous occasions.  Later I checked my Alexa app, and the Nest Thermostat was not a listed device.  I tried to add it, but Alexa wouldn’t discover it.  Then it dawned on me that I had replaced the thermostat a few weeks ago due to a warranty issue.  I’m guessing I haven’t tried to use the skill since then and that maybe that was the issue.  So I uninstalled the thermostat from my Nest app and reinstalled it.  Alexa still won’t discover it.    For info, the thermostat works fine from the Nest app.  Also it is online and on the same network as the Alexa app.  But Alexa can’t see it.  Any ideas?"

"You are 100% CORRECT in saying this! Two years ago, I to could basically whisper a question to Alexa and she would know what I'm saying (I would even have the TV on and it would be set to a high volume). I could also talk very quickly and in a almost mumbling manner and she would know what I was saying. In addition to her hearing issues, she has become increasingly ""DUMBER""! I could ask her just about anything, when I first purchased her and she would answer correctly most of the time. NOW, she is pathetic! I ask her questions and easily over 70% of the time,  she doesn't have an answer; or she gives an incorrect answer. The good ol', ""mmm, I don't know that""; or the ""sorry, I'm not sure about that."" This PROBLEM is NOT in our heads! Something seemed to happen in her earlier coding/programming. Either way, I wish the Amazon Alexa Coders would revert her back to an earlier revision/update."

"Hi guys, hoping for some advice here. I'm sure this may be an easy fix, but I'm quite unfamiliar with smart home assistants so need some help.  I got an echo dot as a present recently and was trying to set it up in my mother's room. We were going through the short tutorial where Alexa asks the owner to repeat a few phrases so that it can learn my mother's voice. However, it kept stopping after saying something like, ""Please say: 'Alexa, --'"". After a few frustrating tries, I realized Alexa was stopping to listen for commands after ITSELF said ""Alexa""!

"Our living room has some hue lights and a Hive thermostat. When I first installed everything the Hive thermostat was off everytime I woke up in the morning. After I short while we figures it was because the thermostat turns off (not following the schedule either) when Alexa was asked to turn off the lights in the living room.   The only way to circumvent this bug is by putting the thermostat in a different group. This annoying because you can't just tell it to change the heat easily, because you keep having to specify the group it's in.   This has been an issue for a while now (an older post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/9ury3k/alexa_turns_onoff_thermostat_when_i_tell_her_to/)) and it is stil happening.

"Playing music on multi-room speaker groups used to work great about 6-9+ months ago. But at some point it was like the feature was taken away: suddenly Alexa acted like she wasn't even hearing me ask to play to any group except ""Everywhere"". If I enunciated it with my mouth nearly on top of the microphone, she wouldn't understand.   I've tried erasing all the speaker groups and recreating them, I've reset the devices and readded them to groups, I've tried using custom name groups and also default room-groups, all to no avail.

"If i ask Alexa to play for example Nothing else matters by Metallica, she repeats Nothing else matters by metallica from spotify before playing the song. This is really annoing. Is there a way to stop her from repeating and just play the song ? I have brief mode activated this didnt do anything."
"Hi guys,  In the last days im testing Alexa as my default virtual assistant and putting Google aside. And surprisingly it's doing well! I don't have the echo devices yet but on the next days will bought one. But what I wanted to know is, is there any way to send sms or voice messages without the echos? I mean, only through the Alexa app in the cellphone?"
"I got Govee lightstrips off Amazon that do not have Alexa voice control, so I got an iHome SmartPlug so I can be able to use Alexa with my lightstrips. I can use alexa to turn the lightstrips on and off, but I’m wondering if there is anyways to use Alexa to change the colour of the lightstrips instead of only on and off?"
i have an echo dot in my bedroom and an echo show 8 in my living room.  When i play music on my dot it also plays on the show.  When i ask to turn the volume down on the show it turns the volume down on the dot.  They have different wake-up words.  How do i prevent the two from communicating with each other?
"I have been trying for the past hour to update my app and it won’t do so. I tried deleting the app and redownloading it but that’s not working either. It stays blacked out and one show and progress downloading. I tried turning off my phone and that didn’t work, even downloaded different apps and those were fine. Not sure what to do.   I’m using iPhone XS Max"
"I have been trying to download the Alexa app from the iOS App Store for my iPhone X. Version 13+.  Is Compatible per the app manuf.  it will download 25% then stop.  I have deleted the app and then retried to download from the cloud (not sure how it’s finished there since it never finished).  Have restarted phone, set data to roaming on, download allowed on clerk at and WiFi, no limit, nothing.      Download again on WiFi, 2ghz, 5ghz.... nothing.  Not sure what else to do or if this is even the correct place to post."
"I've been hoping for a while that we'd get this feature, since it doesn't seem like a difficult thing to implement. Where would I go to propose this feature? Sometimes I miss something that was said and it'd be helpful to be able to rewind 15 seconds or whatever.   Also great would be the ability to skip ahead in Flash-Briefings rather than having to move through them one-by-one, only able to do ""previous"" or ""next"". Frustrating when Alexa resets or glitches and the flash briefing starts over from the beginning. It takes forever to get to where I left off."
"Enjoy the Apple Music integration into the Amazon environment.  However, I'm struggling to play Apple Music stations.  ""The Mixtape"" will sometimes play if I ask correctly, however, my station based on Miles Davis' song *Blue in Green* always results in Alexa playing ""my station,"" which is apparently based on songs I listen to with great frequency.  What is the syntax required for Alexa to understand that I want to play an Apple Music station based on a song.  Please note that this is an existing station inside of Apple Music from selecting ""Create Station"" when right clicking on a particular track.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!"
"In the last week, I've started to get 30 second ads before and after the Reuters news brief starts on my Start My Day routine. Is this happening to anyone else? Wonder if it's unique to Reuters."

"I've got the ""Big Mouth Billy Bass"" Alexa Gadget hooked up to my Echo Show (2nd gen). I'm having an issue when it comes to timers, reminders, and notifications. Billy flops around like he's supposed to while the notification is ringing, but he continues to do so for a minute or two after I dismiss it.  This is the case on both my 2nd gen Show and my friend's 1st gen Show, which are linked to different accounts and WiFi networks. Haven't tested with a normal Echo or Dot because I don't have one handy.  Has anyone else seen this before, and are there any troubleshooting steps specific to the Billy Bass? Is there a way to ""factory reset"" it, clear its Bluetooth pairings, or whatever?  Thanks for your help with this fishy situation."

Wondering how well the Alexa integration with Nvidia Shield works?  Can you have Alexa open specific apps?  Can Alexa control playback?  Can you request Alexa to play specific content?  Also do you have to invoke Alexa like some skills require and say something like “Alexa tell Shield to...”
"Every morning for the last 3 years I wake up:  ""Alexa tell me about my day""  I have it slimmed down to only give me the weather and play reuters. This morning I got a 90 second pre-roll ad for oracle (and it was LOUD). I thought it misheard me. The next morning same thing, same pre-roll ad.  &amp;#x200B;  I figure, if its going to give me ads when I ask it a question before answering, i wont be asking it questions anymore.  &amp;#x200B;  Is it just me, or is everyone getting ads before the ""tell me about my day"" ?"
"Kind of confusing but I would like to emulate me speaking a command to my Alexa as part of a routine.  Essentially I would like my echo show to automatically show my ring doorbell when there's motion or a ring. The only way to do this right now is to say ""Alexa show me my front door"".   Is there anyway I can add a command to my routine to make Alexa ""think"" that i said this command?"

"Hi everyone, wondering if anyone can help, one of my 3 Alexa’s doesn’t work like the other two (they’re all dot 3rd gen) one of them refuses to play BBC radio, it refuses to play various other radio stations, it only sometimes allows adjustments to be made to hive (you have to say “tell hive to set the heating to 22 degrees instead of just “turn heating up to 22 degrees) It also takes multiple attempts to arm the ring alarm system via this troublesome Alexa. They’re all on the same network with the same skills and settings any help would be greatly appreciated thanks"
"I know that alexa can play music, audiobooks, and podcasts. trouble is I don't use amazon music for music, most of my audiobooks are not listened to with audible and I use a different podcatcher than the ones listed that work with alexa. I would like to create skills to have alexa open the correct apps, but I don't see any templates that would do something like that. any idea how to do that? if it helps I do have tasker installed."

"My security system can be armed via voice command through Alexa but not disarmed.  My problem is there does not seem to be a routine function. I want my ""goodbye"" routine to turn off all the lights, turn off the audio on my echos, then ""arm alarm away.""  Since I can easily do this via voice command, is there a way to add that voice command to a routine?  I would rather not say 2 voice commands when 1 should do the trick.  Security system is Vivint if that helps."
"So recently if anyone has had issues where you ask Alexa to play a song on Spotify and nothing happens I may have a solution. If you happen to have multiple Alexa’s connected to the same Spotify account, try disabling the Spotify skill in the Alexa app on all the other Alexa’s but the one you want to use and see if that fixes your issue. It worked for me. Hope this helps!!"
"Alexa is connected to my blink cameras, if I ask to show me kitchen it shows me a live stream of my kitchen. If I say ""alexa arm blink cameras"" or ""alexa ask blink to arm kitchen"" she says ""I've asked your home system to arm"" but then nothing happens. The cameras don't arm. Any ideas?"
"So every once and a while one of my Echos will beep like it’s making an announcement and some woman’s voice will say something in an foreign language??!! I have no idea what’s she’s saying or what triggers this to happen. It sounds like the same recorded “message” every time. I have more then one Echo in the house, but it only happens on this one particular Echo, and never the others. I’ve checked the settings and can’t see anything wrong. Am I the only one this happens to?"
"I haven't had the Echo Auto for very long, but a few times now, it has randomly started playing a song that's in my Amazon Music. I'll be playing a game on Echo Auto, and all of the sudden a song starts playing in the background. And not from the start of the song, but in the middle somewhere. And it's not a song I've listened to recently.   It's not happening enough that it's a problem, but it is def annoying. And if you ask her to stop playing it, she won't. I just power the unit off and back on, losing my place in the game. Is this happening to anyone else?   I have Echo Auto connected via aux, and I have the individual Amazon Music plan. I did not have Amazon Music open on my phone. And it's not a song I listened to at home on Echo Dot. I didn't touch anything on my phone to make it start playing either. Let me know if you have any advice!"
Is it possible to play separate music on each? We have the flex set up in our twins nursery. It’s nice to be able to run routines without yelling out to the other echo devices. Today I had lullabies playing on the flex but wanted to listen to some music on the Echo dot while in the kitchen. It started playing music on command but it kicked off the flex audio in the nursery. Then I tried playing music in the kitchen first and then went to the nursery to play lullabies again only to see it drops the audio on the echo dot. Anyway to make this work? Is the flex just an extension of one of our echo devices and not it’s own unit?

"I can get Alexa talking to Feit RGB Smart Bulbs to turn on, off, and color in groups or not, but I have not been able to execute a Smart Scene, such as ""Order 66"" (turn off all bulbs) or ""Order 23"" (set living room bulbs on and dark red). Has anyone been able to use Alexa for Smart Scenes?  Also.. I realize Order 66 could be done with grouping, but ""Alexa turn off Order 66"" doesn't have the same ring to it"

"I have Legrand light switches and I have the Legrand Skill installed on my Echos. Everything has been working fine up until today. I asked Alexa to turn the light switch on and it said that the server is unresponsive. I looked at the devices in the Alexa app and saw the same message.   I decided to log out of the Legrand Skill. Now I am unable to log back in. Has anyone else experienced this with their Legrand light switches and Echos?  As a side note, I have my Legrand light switches connected to HomeKit and they are working fine."
"My Echo show is opening YouTube directly on the Echo screen instead of the connected TV (Sony Android TV Xf8095 with Fire TV). Also if I wanted to change TV channels I have to specify the tv's name instead of Just saying ""Alexa go to Channel 6"". Is there a way to set the TV as default output of videos for the Echo show?"
"Playing Spotify app on my fire stick and at least once every song it will stop for a few seconds, screen will say something along the lines of “disconnected etc...” then will come back on it’s on.  Pretty annoying.  No other issues with any other device in my home. Amazon music doesn’t ever do it.  I have a mesh system, thoughts?"
"I have several echos in the house and smart wall switches in several rooms to control the ceiling fans and lights. These are all named “room name lights” and “room name fan”.   Is there a setting that will allow me to omit the room when commanding Alexa in that room? For instance- when in my son’s room, he has to command,”Alexa turn on junior’s lights.” He would prefer to say “Alexa, turn on the lights.”   When he does that now she replies, “Hmm there are several devices named lights. Which one do you mean?”  I have a group set up as a room that includes his echo and the two smart switches for the light and the fan."
"My Alexa have some serious issues. I bought my echo dot 3 in September last year and it started pretty good. But now I have to literally shout “Alexa” 2 or 3 times before she hears me. And when I try to play a song on Spotify she always plays on Amazon music which I’ve disabled in my Alexa app. And finally, I can’t play on Spotify all the time. It just says “connecting” and then nothing else happens."
"My uncle and I just recently started using Alexa. He's also got some wifi lightbulbs so he can use Alexa to control the lighting and he's started talking about connecting it to our RF controlled heating system. Problem is, if our connection craps out on us, we won't be able to control anything because Alexa is dependant on the internet. Can you get a local server for Alexa?"

"I got an Echo Show 8 for my 85 year old aunt living by herself. I found out that adding as my device created problems that I have documented in other reddit posts. So I created a separate amazon account for her using my email but her name. However, I did not put in a credit card or address for her account since I did not want her (or someone else) accidentally ordering something. This lack of address, it turns out, affects Alexa and the Echo Show contacts. Read on.  I logged into “her” Alexa account, disabled contact syncing with my phone and proceeded to add contacts that she might need - just 4-5 of them.  Now, on her Echo Show 8, I tried to find those contacts. Only a couple of contacts that had other Alexa accounts would show up and those that were just phone numbers would not be seen at all even if tapping All Contacts button on the Echo. However, she could “Call” those contacts. Then me and Amazon support went back and forth trying many different things including resetting the Alexa account to fix this problem. I have to admire the patience of Stephen from Amazon who worked with me over 4 weeks (since I could go to my Aunts house only once a week) to figure out various things that might be wrong.   Finally, this week Amazon tech support added an billing address to her account and voila! It was fixed.   Thought this might help someone in the future if I posted it. My Aunt loves her Echo but coming from an Apple Ecosystem, I really dislike the interface and inconsistent commands !"
"I just got my echo show 8, and I can’t connect to my prime video. Not in the alexa app nor on the show itself. I’m based in the netherlands not sure if that’s the reason. Any tips on how to getting it to work?"
"It occurs to me that we don't need smart switches as much as a switch which allows us to directly flick a light on or off, yet not interfere with the operation of smart tech in our home.   It's great to ask Alexa to switch the kitchen light off from another room, not so much when I'm standing right next to the switch."

"I have numerous echo devices, however the Echo Show seems to be the worst at listening. It either doesn't stop when I tell it to stop/cancel and always mishears me when I ask a question. I've had occasional hiccups with the other devices, but this one seems to be the worst.   Any solutions?"

"I've created a few routines and assigned them to different devices. But it seems that only one routine kicks off. Shouldn't I be able to have different routines enabled for different devices? For example, I've setup a bedtime routine that shuts off lights. And that works.

"She only seems to hear me saying ""boat"" anyone else have this issue? Anyone know any way to cheese her into spelling the correct word?  I've tried different pronunciations and even accents.   I'm dyslexic, her ability to spell words for me is important - sometimes I cant manage to spell a word correctly enough to find it with a dictionary.  Thank you"
"Hi - we encountered a situation yesterday where it became apparent that an Alexa trigger word had caused a skill to be enabled on our Echos, without any confirmation or approval. I am concerned about this because I know that skills can set up financial subscriptions.  Voice purchasing was enabled, but protected with a passcode/PIN.    So, am I being unduly concerned, or is this genuinely potentially a scam attack vector?  Can a silently installing skill also silently create charges or subscriptions?  Can you switch off the auto-installing of skills? These concerns have me ready to unplug the Echos entirely.    Thanks in advance!"
I just got 5 echo dots and want to setup a routine for dinner to go out on multiple dots. Is there a way to have an announcement or a dinner bell made that can be played on more than 1 speaker at the same time?
"Tonight, I was watching a nostalgic video about 80s/90s British kids' TV shows. As I'm sure many of you do, whenever I watch anything, I ask Alexa stuff all the time. Actors' ages, character names, words or concepts that are new to me: if she doesn't know the answer, I then look them up online. We all do that, right? It's just how we watch stuff. We're geeks with ADD and a thirst for knowledge.  So I'm watching my video. Idly, already knowing the answer and not really expecting a quality reply, I decided to test Alexa:  **""Alexa, what's the name of Postman Pat's cat?""**  I'm astonished to say she answered:   *""Jess the Cat was played by Melissa Sinden in the show Postman Pat.""*  Uh... ok, wow! She knew it. I usually have low expectations of Alexa, so I was surprised by her ability to answer correctly. Pretty neat, I thought.  Before I continue, let me say I'm a linguist by profession and background. I love grammar, syntax, spelling, the whole shebang. I'm a nerd.  That's why I then asked her, **""Alexa, who's the cat on Postman Pat?""**   *""Jess the Cat was played by Melissa Sinden in the show Postman Pat.""*  Uh flip! She did it again! So far, so impressive! From this point on, I was hooked.  It got me wondering: Alexa seemed to recognise Postman Pat as both a TV show and a character. What would happen if I blurred the syntax a little, or added my own native British English?  When I tweaked the question slightly and asked, **""Alexa, who's Postman Pat's cat?""**, she struggled to answer directly:   *""Here's something I found on Wikipedia... ""Guess with Jess"" is a British-Canadian series etc etc.""*  Oof. Did Alexa think of Postman Pat only as a show, rather than a character? Did she need Postman Pat to be preceded by ""on""? But then why could she answer ""Postman Pat's cat""? Guys, my mind was awash.  My next question was, **""Alexa, who plays the cat on Postman Pat?""**   *""Jess the Cat was played by Melissa Sinden in the show Postman Pat.""*  So that worked, and seemed to confirm the theory of needing to say ""on"" (the ""name of Postman Pat's cat"" question notwithstanding).  In any case, it impressed me that Alexa could correctly answer questions about relatively obscure/niche British kids' shows, even when the full name of the character (Jess) wasn't mentioned.  It's not the first phrasing I tried, though. I then got freaky with it and asked in a more naturally British way:  **""Alexa, what's Postman Pat's cat called?""** \[a common British variant\]   *""Cat is called felis catus, felis domesticus and felis silvestris catus.""* **FAIL**  **""Alexa, what's Postman Pat's cat's name?""** \[no doubt too many possessives\]   *""Hmm, I'm not sure.""* **FAIL**  Again, it seemed Alexa recognised Postman Pat as a show/thing but not necessarily as a character, and possessives confused her. So I tried using the common British phrase ""what is X called"",  but with the concept of Postman Pat as a show:  ""**Alexa, what's the cat called \*on\* Postman Pat?""**   *""Sorry, I'm not sure about that.""*  Clearly, Alexa wasn't equating ""named"" and the equally British phrasing ""being called"".  And thus ended my adventure. I'd learned a little more about how Alexa operates, and become a little sadder as I contemplated my own profound loneliness...  Alexa and I don't speak anymore. My only friends are Pat and Jess."
"I have a location based routine set up to turn on lights, TVs, etc when I arrive home from work. Tonight I was on the phone when I arrived home and the routine did not run. I tried putting my call on speaker and manually running the routine in the app but it would not run that way either.   I hung up my phone call and tried to manually run the routine again and it ran successfully.   Is this a known issue?? Because coming home to a dark house because I am on the phone seems like a ridiculous flaw in routines capability."

Hi.  I’d like to enable Alexa to speak our local tides though using routine.   As part of a morning routine in the bathroom it reads the weather and traffic but I’d like it to say the tide times also.   I can add the skill to a routine but you then have to ask location etc.   Has anyone found a way to do this.  Thanks!
Hello! I have a fire stick but I just bought a smart tv- is there any reason to have both? I was going to give the fire stick to someone who doesn't have a smart tv or any other way to stream stuff. Thanks!
"Does Alexa have the capability to control which apps open up on the fire stick?  I already have the firestick + harmony + Alexa working. If I say Alexa turn on the TV, everything loads up and I get to the home screen of the fire stick.  I would like to take it a step further and say ""Alexa open up youtubetv or Netflix, etc"". Does this skill or capability exists?"
"I like using guard mode, even when sleeping. For those who don't know, one of its features is it randomly turns and off smart lights to make it look like someone's home. However, I use my bedside lamp/Hue as an alarm clock, gently illuminating the room till I wake. Occasionally Alexa will turn it on while I'm sleeping, waking me the f up and can't go back to sleep.  I can't figure out a way, or if to exclude certain lights from guard mode. It probably isn't possible, but I'm asking anyway. Thanks."

I and many if not most people aren't comfortable with always having their camera active though (which is a huge part of why Amazon includes covers). Rather than sign to act as an activation word, it would probably be best to just simply require the user to push a button to then allow Alexa to activate her camera and begin reading sign language.  Yes, of course there are many sign language dialects. It would probably be best to start with ASL."

"I've had an echo dot and alexa a few days.  I don't have a smartphone or smartlights or anything set up.  I've just been playing games like song quiz.  Today I try and alexa says, 'please unlock your device""?  I didn't lock anything and I don't know how to unlock.  Please help!"
"When I say Alexa turn off/on living room light, Alexa will turn off/on EVERYTHING in the living room and this just only started today. And ideas?"
"Hi,  I had 3 Echos (2 dot and 1 flex) in a multi-room music group called ""Everywhere"".    Today I received another flex and wanted to add it to the group.  As I opened the Alexa app and browse to the multi-room group to add it, the device would always display ""Device Unreachable"" (while being very online, alexa would do anything I asked her...)  I tried deleting the group and recreate it to hit a wall:  -As I land on the page to select the devices part of the new group, my 2 dots show as ""Online"" and the 2 flex as ""Available"" - what's the difference? -If I select 1 dot, both flex turn to ""Device Unreachable"" -If I select 1 flex, both dot turn to ""Device Unreachable""  Anyone faced such issue?  I reached out to Amazon and they want me to call in to troubleshoot...  I see nothing online saying dots and flexs can't be in the same group, and I use to have a group of 2 dot and 1 flex which I can't even re-create, what is this!?"
Perhaps this isn't the place. But there's a potential lawsuit against Alexa for illegal recording. Does anyone know where to sign up for compensation?
"Apologies if this is not the right place to post this, but my Alexa device randomly stopped being able to interact with my TV a couple of months ago.  Alexa will just say ""Sorry, I'm having trouble with VIZIO smartcast"" when I issue a command.  I've tried re-pairing the devices together, rebooting all of my devices, and even doing a factory reset on my TV to no avail.  UPNP is enabled on my router as well, and I don't have any ports blocked.  The TV model is a VIZIO e65-e1 if that helps, but it feels like the two devices became incompatible overnight.  Any ideas on what else I could check?"
"I paired to Gen3 dots (I think, the ones with carpet on the sides), named it Office, one as left and one as right. Now when   me: ""alexa, play spotify""  alexa: ""this is spotify""  nothing plays...  &amp;#x200B;  me: ""alex, play spotify on the office""  alexa: ""this is spotify""  nothing....  &amp;#x200B;  I have to go into the Alexa app and play it manually. It will play from there, but lost it through commands. Anyone else see this?"
"Anyone been able to fix this issue successfully?  I'm thinking about deleting all groups and devices and starting from scratch but that is a hassle.  The weird thing is, I can say ""Alexa turn all the lights to 0"" and it will work, but if i say ""Alexa turn all the lights off"" I get the ""I'm not quite sure what went wrong"" every time. Very frustrating."
"I got this error message when trying to set up an Alexa device.  ""The was an problem..""   Seriously?Doesn't anyone proof this stuff?  https://preview.redd.it/q7ztuehys4f41.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f586531395faf59a4c1f51dd2b71283ea8b48200"
I know there is a skill called WOL (wake on LAN) that allows you to wake your pc up from sleep mode. But is there any way Alexa can power on my pc when I shut it down?

"I created a routine that reminds me to take out garbage the night before the trash collection day. But if I’m not next to the Echo speaker, it sometimes is lost on me.   Is there a way to leave a notification to the speaker - the kind that turns the yellow light on - as an action to a routine? It seems that I can leave a notification but only on the Alexa app on the mobile device i’m creating a routine with, not on an Echo speaker."
Do I have to manually go into the Alexa settings and delete my recordings every day or can I set something up automatically to delete my recordings every day?
"Set a timer in the kitchen, sit on the bed in the bedroom and ask the echo how much time I have left on my timer, only to be told that I have no timers set.  Yet, when I hear the timer going off in the kitchen, I can say ""Alexa Stop"" and the alarm stops.  Curious!"
"Hi,  Currently in a dillema whether I should get the echo 5 vs the dot?  I can wait an additional 2-3 days to get the show 8. The speaker quality is important for me (audiobooks, music, etc). Which one has the best?   Thanks"

"On Sunday I was quizzing Alexa on football knowledge.  &gt; What was the forty niners versus packers score?   &gt; In the NFC Championship on Sunday, January 19, the 49ers beat the Packers 37-20 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.  Oh yea, they moved.  &gt; Who plays at candlestick park?   &gt; I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to that question.  Today, I got a notification... I wasn't expecting anything to be shipped.  &gt; Answer Update.  &gt; Previously, you asked...   &gt; Who plays at candlestick park?   &gt; 49 giants.   Asking this now gives:  &gt; According to an Amazon customer: 49 giants  So its crowd sourced (raw '49 giants' rather than an image from Wikipedia and knowledge base info).  As to the notification - there's apparently a notification setting:  &gt; Answer Updates.  &gt; Every day Alexa has new answers to questions that she did not know before. Allow Alexa to notify you of these answers as she learns something new about the questions you asked previously.  Just one of those interesting things that's out there."
"Amazon has definitely ruined my love for being named Alexa. On a daily basis I am subjected to bad/unoriginal jokes and every person named Alexa has been hit on with HORRIBLE pick up lines. Can we start a petition that people named Alexa should AT LEAST get prime for free? It really does suck sometimes. However, I kind of feel bad for ex’s of someone named Alexa because you hear that shit everywhere."
"I've seen this without resolve on a few web searches and I've been suffering from it for quite some time now. I spent some time with a chat agent and had to verify my devices, sent a screen shot of my amazon app, deleted my only two routines that I still have, and made them again. Chat agents don't have access to the routines but I was told to see if the scheduled stuff is still happening tomorrow and then they'll raise the ticket to the dev team. It's been happening for a year now and I'm tired of having my fan turn off right before my alarm with no control over it.        If someone has run into a similar situation with a resolution please let me know, hopefully I'll remember to add to this if I find a fix for the next person that searches."
Am I right I’m thinking the ability to include a skill as an action is completely pointless as there is no way to specify what skill command the routine is to invoke?   Or am I totally wrong and there is a way?  Thanks in advance.
"So whoever designed the alarm function in Alexa has apparently never even heard of any kind of job outside of a Monday through Friday 9 to 5, since the only possible repeat options for alarms are everyday, weekends, and every weekday. I would like to set reoccurring alarms that happen on some weekdays and one of the weekend days. Is there some alternative method to achieving this other than creating 5 separate single-day repeating alarms?"
"Whenever I add something with ""And"" to my to do list, Alexa instantly splits it into two different entries. Here is an example - ""Wash and Dry Clothes"" would be added as ""Wash"", ""Dry Clothes"". Is there a way to fix that?"
"I'd previously posted about Alexa's annoying greetings periodically cropping up when I ask the time, but the solution appeared to be to enable Brief mode.  https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/encpob/alexa_keeps_hoping_i_have_a_nice/  That wasn't really a solution for me as I don't want to shorten the responses to my usual requests as I like to confirm that she has understood when I requested a song or radio station.   So, a few days ago when I asked the time she responded with the usual: ""The time is 11am... I hope you're having a wonderf..."" at this point I shouted ""Alexa stop and shut the f*** up""   I think saying ""Alexa stop"" at that moment was probably sufficient ;)  Anyway I no longer get the annoying greeting when I'm groggy in the morning and just want to know the time.  It may come back alright, but at least I have one workaround."
"By default, when an Alexa device in away mode detects one of the sounds it's listening for, it does 3 things. It makes a little noise, flashes a little light, and sends your phone a notification (test this if you want by setting away mode and playing ""glass breaking sound effect"" on YouTube on your phone). You can actually set it to **only** send your phone a notification and not light up or make sound. This isn't in guard mode settings, though, and I haven't found any info explaining it online. I had to test it for myself to see what it does.   To do this open the Alexa app on your phone, go to devices, echo &amp; Alexa, and the device you use guard mode on. Scroll down to ""sounds"", then scroll all the way down to ""selected sound detection"". Turn on ""selected sound detection"" if you want your device to indicate that it's sent you a notification, and turn it off if you want your device to stealthily send you a notification.   I'm torn whether to have it on or off. Idk if the little light and sound will scare burglars off (good) or just make them rob my apartment faster (bad). Tbh I think them knowing that I've been tipped off will only make them rob my apartment faster, and then the police are less likely to arrive in time to catch them in the act. I'd rather they take their sweet time thinking no one knows they're in my apartment - until the police show up out of ""nowhere"". Greater likelihood of me getting my stuff back... let me know what y'all think, though, because I really don't know!"

"So, I used to do this every day without issue, but the last week or two, it's been messing up and I can't figure out why.  I'll say ""Alexa, play (show) on Netflix.""  It used to say ""playing (show) on Netflix"" and open Netflix and play right away, no issues. But lately, when I say the exact same thing, it says ""playing (show) on prime video.""  The show I'm talking about has been, and still is, on both prime video and Netflix. Noting has changed there. Any ideas why it would refuse to use Netflix all of a sudden?"
I have device control set up on my Xbox along with Alexa as a digital assistant. This works great for turning my xBox / TV on and off and adjusting the TV volume when I used to use the TV speakers.  I’ve since hooked up an echo studio to the tv and volume is now controlled via the echo studios volume settings..  The problem is that when the Xbox is on Alexa seems to prefer changing the volume on the tv (via the Xbox) rather than adjusting volume settings on the Echo Studio that I’m using as a sound bar.  No matter how I issue the command (e.g. “Alexa turn echo studio volume up.”) it always changes the tv volume and not the echo volume.  Any idea how to get this working properly? I feel like I used to have to specifically state “Alexa tell Xbox to turn up the tv volume.” but now that’s no longer necessary. Was there a recent update to how Xbox integration works?

"I am a TA for a voice interfaces class. Most of our assignments are Alexa skills that the students develop, and we grade assignments by having students add me as a beta tester on their skill. So far it's been a great setup.     Now we're trying to add a second beta-testing account to our class's Alexa device. I downloaded the Alexa app and added the second account to my 'Household', but it doesn't seem like that was enough. When I make the second account a beta tester on a new skill and enable the skill for that account, I still can't use it on my Alexa device. I don't even know how to verify that the device knows about the second account at all.     Has anyone run into something similar to this?"

Can anyone tell me why Alexa refuses to stop playing Sleep Sounds (Babbling Brook) if it's on loop? This is extremely frustrating -- having to unplug the device (or use the phone app) as the only way to stop the noise is ridiculous.
"I hope this makes sense. I’m having trouble with getting Alexa to play my Apple Music. When it comes to Spotify, I can get on my Spotify app and I have the option of connecting to my echo dot. (Picture shown) but when it comes to Apple Music, that option doesn’t show up. it’s the same way for Pandora as well. Spotify is the only app where I have the option of connecting to my Echo Dot. The only solution is to go into my phones Bluetooth settings and connect my entire phone to the speaker, but that’s NOT what I want to do. If anyone can help me, thanks!  and yes I can simply yell at Alexa and tell her what to play, but that’s also not what I want to do. I want to be able to control Alexa from the Apple Music app."
"We have a number of dots, but it seems this is an all or nothing. If we turn the filtering off so my wife and I can listen to our music, then it turns it off for all of them.  How would I set these up so two of the dots have the filtering and two do not?"
"Hey All,    I had a Sonos bean that I don’t own anymore.  I removed all instances and mentions of it from the Alexa app and deregistered it.

If I unplug it and plug it back in, it works again, but after a certain time, the problem comes back. What should I do?"
"Amazon Echo (Alexa) Gathering anyone???   Shoot me a private message if you are interested.   I have been wanting to attend one of these gatherings for a long time, but I just never found any to attend. So I decided I would just have one of my own. Anyone interested in meeting up to discuss their love/hate relationship with Alexa? If you live in NYC, or can get to NYC, NJ or Connecticut. I am especially interested in meeting up with newbies who would like help learning how to setup their devices. Demonstrating for them what their Amazon Echo devices can do. If not newbies, then just discussing with other users their love or frustrations with using the devices. We might actually learn something we didn’t already know from one another. I will be bringing two of my Echo devices. You are welcome to bring yours, but it is not necessary. Bring pen and paper to take notes. NO RECORDING ALLOWED.   In NYC I can reserve a small meeting room. Space will be limited. The max number of attendees will be 10 people. So first come, first serve. So I am looking for the first 9 interested people.   Those of you living in New Jersey or Connecticut. I am willing to travel. I would need suggestions of where in those locals we could meet. I am usually in the Wayne, NJ area on Saturday mornings anyway so some place close to there. Keep in mind it must be someplace free, has electricity and has WiFi.   NYC -  Possible Dates and Times are:  Saturday, February 22, 2020 or Saturday, February 29, 2020; 3pm - 5 pm or 4pm - 6pm. We can only be in the room for 2 hours. Please vote on which date and time. Majority rules. If interest is high I can see if I can get both dates. Location, directions and agreed upon time will be disclosed only to confirmed attendees. Future Dates can be scheduled depending on interest level and space availability.   Remember to send me a private message if you are interested."
"I've had my new echo dot setup for about a week now.  The first morning I wake up at 430am to get ready for work, and whilst frying up my customary morning eggiwegs, fat beats begin emanating from my dot!   Fortunately the volume was low and the remainder of the house maintained their steady slumbers.  I says, ""What the devil?"" And bark for Alexa to whoa doggy.  Not even dos minutos later I hear the sickest bass drop coming from my newly setup but seemingly bedeviled echo dot!   I tell it to stop stop stop with all I can muster.  This continues through the first week.   Eventually, the plug is pulled and a 21 gun salute ensues, again without asking..  The app history shows nada in regards to the aforementioned. Fat beat and sick bass drop radio stations arent even on my list of previously listened to Pandora or Spotify stations.  When I asked, ""Alexa what the deuce""? The response is ""Oh, I thought you told me to do that.  Well Alexa, if someone told you to jump off a bridge...   The contraption is positioned strategically in the dining quarters, adjacent to the rooms that I want receiving a majority of the fanfare. This includes my kitchen.  Why this matters?  The fridge has been rumbly grumbly as of late. And so I'm half heartedly convinced the 2 have found a way to express their unduly and artificial emotions.

"Hi All. My kids (10,9) each have an Echo Dot with Clock in their rooms. I'm trying to set up Individually tailored routines so that each morning the following happens:  Alarm goes off kid dismisses alarm *Dismiss triggers routine*  I have daily morning routines for each child, that goes through their activities for the day (Uniform type, after school sports, library, lessons etc). This routine is unique to each child, and each morning is different.  The problem I am having is I've realised that at the start of the routine it kicks off when 'an alarm is dismissed', but can't find a way for it to isolate which device the alarm is dismissed on. So if I want to set different alarm times for my kids, the one who dismisses their alarm first kicks off the morning routine on my other child's Echo dot even though their alarm hasn't gone off.  I hope that all makes sense, I'm new to Alexa and trying to wrap my head around it all... But basically I want to know if there's a better way for me to set up my devices? Can you get child accounts or would that makes things too complicated in app? Does anyone else use multiple devices for family organisation and could give me some tips?  In case it is important, I also have an Echo Show 5 in my bedroom, and another Echo Show 5 in the kitchen.  Thanks in advance!"
So I want to use my evening routine to trigger when the sun sets.  Has Alexa updated allowing me to use one of my existing routines to create a new routine? Or Do I have to input all my light settings manually into the new routine again?

"Wondering if FreeTime is what’s causing my Kid’s Echo dot to act up. I almost never need to reboot any of my other Echo devices, but this one needs to be unplugged and plugged back in at least 1-3 times per week. I only bought it because the blue/white went well with the room it’s in. Figured I’d use the FreeTime for my son but rarely take advantage of it. Is freezing/not listening a common thing for kids echos with FreeTime or do I probably have a bad unit?"

"Hi everyone, I've been using my alexa alarm and have a routine set for when I dismiss it to do a couple things to start my day. I'm a SUPER deep sleeper so while I don't rely on it solely, it is super helpful to have in addition to my other alarms. I've noticed it's not going off lately. It was set for 4a for a week or so and seemed to work fine, but I bumped it up to 3:50 to help encourage that I'm OUT of bed by 4a, not just barely waking up, and it's not going off anymore.   I searched a lot and found a post on here from 1y ago where someone else noticed that their alarms don't go off between 2a and 4a but didn't see any solutions found.

I have a feeling this can be achieved with routines or skill blueprints, but I can't figure out exactly how to set it up."
"Just with ""Alexa"" app routines and an Echo Dot. Is a Fire TV required to get it to work? My stereo is connected with a 3.5mm to RCA cable to an Echo Dot. I want to be able to say ""Alexa stereo music"" and have the Fire TV Blaster turn on my stereo (with infrared) and then the Echo Dot start playing music. Which because of the 3.5mm cable will come out of my stereo."
Is there a sound bar with a wireless subwoofer other than the Polk command bar which has the capability to handle Alexa multi room music with Alexa devices? That’s the only one that I can figure out actually works with the multi room music
"Hello,  I've been struggling with setting up some smart home devices in my new home but I have so many questions regarding the right combinations of devices that I should be getting.  I tried the following setup: Ring security system Yale Assure SL lock Amazon Key Edition Amazon Cloud Cam Key Edition  This setup successful worked with Amazon in home delivery, although I could see how the apps were lacking some very important functionality from Amazon, like Amazon Household, meaning that my wife was not able to order In-Home delivery from her account and she was not able to see the cameras or the smart Lock  from the Key app.   Ring system successful integrated with Amazon Key, allowing me to see and use the smart Lock from the Ring app. However, the most important functionality, disabling the alarm from a successful unlock, was not possible (Think about having an In-Home delivery that would trigger your alarm). Not to mention, my wife's Ring account was never showing the lock. I'm addition to this, Amazon Cloud Cam did not integrate with Ring, so neither me or my wife could see this camera through Ring.   I ended up ordering the other version of the smart lock and a different camera, resulting in the following setup: Ring security system Yale Assure SL lock Z-wave edition Ring Stick up cam.  This setup allows me to arm/disarm the security system with a successful lock/unlock of the smart lock. This system allowed us to have the smart lock and the stick up cam in our Ring account, so we both were able to see all the devices without having to go to different apps. The downfall of this is that this does not work with Amazon Key.  What I would love is: Ring security Yale Assure SL lock Key Edition Amazon Cloud Cam/Stick Cam All devices successful integrating with Ring app, enabling/disabling alarm when locking/unlocking. Having In-Home delivery. Successful Amazon Household enabling me to share these devices with people in my household.   For any of those requests, is there any existing feature request, ticket number or final decision that has been taken to address those missing pieces? It's surprising that the two Ring and Key Amazon owned systems do not work together fully.  Thanks!"

"I got the album “UR Fun” by of Montreal on Amazon Music and for some reason it refuses to play on my echo dot. Commands don’t make it work, casting it from my phone doesn’t work. It plays on my phone fine, and other music streams on the dot fine. But not this one. I haven’t been able to navigate the maze of self service options to get to actual support to figure this out. Anyone see something like this before?"

"Spotify plays nicely through all three of  my echos (echo 1st gen, dot 3rd gen &amp; show 5) individually, but when I set them up as a speaker group, Spotify recognises it but yet they won’t play.

"Hey guys, I'm having a issue with Alexa and playing music.  Basically, when I'm at my home, I will usually say, ""Alexa, play (Artist Name)"" and it will play a song. However, at my brother's house, it will start playing on his Alexa too. I have no idea how this happens or how to stop it happening.  We do share a Amazon prime account as well as Spotify Premium, however, he has his own account. Anyone know how to fix this? I would like to listen to my music without him stopping it on his end."
"I usually can simply say 'Alexa, play Spotify' and it transfers the song i am currently playing on my phone to the echo no issue. However, i connected my Roku and said the same thing and it started playing though my tv, so i disconnected and disabled the Roku skill. Now when i say 'Alexa, play Spotify' it says nonsense that sounds like ""Propidairy can't launch apps on"". I also tried saying 'Alexa, play my current song from spotify' it randomizes my liked song instead of playing the song i was listening to. Has anyone had an issue like this or now how to solve? (FYI I did already try other resetting and deregistering the device)"

I've got my first gen Echo Dot connected to a Fire TV s4K tick and Alexa does follow through with commands and sends them to the TV.

"Hi, so I love Alexa, and I bought an echo show for my mother who lives in spain, but only speak French.  So far i was able to configure the app (which is english, but that's not an issue because i speak english, evidently), in order for alexa to speak French. I added her to my 'unlimited family music account' and i can request (in french) french music. So far so good.  Where things go bad are skills. You'd think, just like the language of the phone app, it would be in english at worst, but because the device has an IP in spain, all the skills are in spanish. In fact, if you ask in french to alexa 'what are the 3 top skills', it uses a french voice to speak in ... spanish. When you go in the (english) app, it shows spanish skills.  In other words, i need to be able to display french skills in french on the echo show - regardless of the languages the app or the websites might need me to use (ultimately, i'm the only admin of the device, my mother just uses it).  Thank you!"
screenshot at times - a very useful feature   let's discuss this further   I am sure there is a way to do it  I am sure someone has done it  likely with some home-brew hack ...

"I ask Alexa to switch Inputs on my Vizio P-Series TV. It keeps saying “I can do that on vizio smartcast, or Fire TV. Which would you like?” all the time!  My Fire TV Stick is in a different room on different TV and it’s in a different Group. It’s very annoying when I ask Alexa to do something on my Vizio TV and it keeps asking me an option between Vizio SmartCast and Fire TV (my Fire TV Stick is not in the same Group)!  Is there a way to make it stop and just use Vizio SmartCast?"
"Is there a way that I can go ""Alexa when I say ""x"" read me reminder ""y"".""? I know I can set up a routine by going into my phone, opening 'routines', making a new routine, naming it, giving it the trigger phrase, adding what I want her to say, then saving and exiting but... I would really like to be able to say ""Alexa, when I say 'goodbye' remind me to take out the trash"" and just have it happen.  It seems like pretty elementary functionality, so why can't I figure out how to make it work?"

I have an Android TV. So it's mostly a google platform with apps I can install. I own a Blink home camera system. That is an Amazon product. The Blink app isn't available for Android TV. I have been reading that other Amazon products might be needed if I want to do this. Apparently it works with a 4k Firestick but people are reporting issues with Alexa. I am thinking about Alexa in general but if I can't use it with Blink then it seems I should be looking elsewhere.  Has anyone solved getting Blink on their Android TV?  I wish Blink would just make an app for it.

"Some comedian while at my house asked Alexa to play some whalesong.    Now, if I ask for some music (ie: play me my most listened to, or a playlist she thinks I might like) I get whalesong far more frequently than I’d like (ie: never).   Is there a way of editing my music preferences somewhere to perform a whalectomy?"
It's impossible to get Alexa to play the Beatles on Spotify. Constantly plays a tribute artist NO MATTER WHAT I SAY. Very irritating. Does this for basically all the songs or albums. I have to go on my phone and turn it on manually.
"So I want my morning routine to fire a specific time before (or after) an entry in my diary as would, I should imagine, anyone else who has a different start time each day for whatever reason. Any way to do this with Alexa?  The only way I can think of is:  Nightly Alexa routine triggers IFTTT to do a webhook to MacroDroid on my phone.  On no then I realise it gets nightmareishly complicated. MacroDroid would have to look up and read my diary and then drive the Alexa app to painfully go in and change the time on my morning routine. That will be a long tedious macro to write and very fragile as it will have to use direct pixel addressing."
"Amazon has a huge opportunity here.  I would gladly switch from Sonos to Echo equipment if the Amazon Alexa app had better music playing functionality.  I want to open the app and play songs or playlists by searching/browsing for them.  Particularly from my Apple Music library.    If you could search/browse for music in the Alexa app and play it simultaneously in multiple rooms, Alexa would  be so much better."

"This has been driving me nuts. I often watch Prime Video on my Firestick 4k in the evening, and sometimes I want to continue watching one of my favorite programs on the Echo Show in bed at night. But often when I ask Alexa to play my program, it doesn't seem to remember where I left off (season/episode). So I try to use the touchscreen to find the episode, but no matter what I've tried, it only shows one season of the program and I can't figure out how to navigate to the season/episode list. The only thing that's worked for me is to ask Alexa for the exact season and episode of the program, but it's a pain the the butt because I can't always remember off the top of my head which episode I left off with, for the various shows I follow.

"Hey all --  I've searched around the sub and didn't find anything exactly on point (sorry if I missed something, please let me know).  I have basically set up a whole home music system using a harmony hub, various echo devices, and existing speaker setups throughout my home (e.g. inputs connected to receivers, dots connected to inputs connected to amps, etc.)  I have never been able to get anything but the fire tvs (not involved in the audio setup) to show up consistently in ""devices"" on spotify -- i've always had to constantly say ""echo spotify connect"" and then wait for it to show up (sometimes it either takes a long time or doesn't show up at all).   Recently I tried amazon music with my prime membership, and everytime i go to the airplay icon, it sees every amazon device on my wifi network, and it is so much easier.  Is it possible to have the same set up in Spotify to get all amazon devices to show up in the ""devices available"" window? Does anyone have specific steps on what they did to achieve this? any help would be appreciated!

For the Alexa devices, I have an Insteon hub (separate from Indigo). It works fine. I also have a SmartThings hub to do Z wave and ... I rage hate the thing. It's utterly useless. It doesn't communicate with the devices half the time, and I can't remove any devices (An unknown error occurred.)  The app is about as useless as can be, too.   Anyway, I'm getting rid of Shitthings, but need a new z-wave hub for the express purpose of using Alexa.   Any recommendations? I basically want to add the z-wave devices (they apparently allow for two controlling hubs). Indigo compatibility is a plus, but is not a requirement."

"Hi all,  Weird issue here. I have the Alexa app on my phone.  I’ve the Echo Dot successfully connected to Wi-Fi.  have the Echo Dot and Sub both showing as Online via the app and paired as a speaker set.    All is online, paired, and good to go.  I hit play music within either the app or from YouTube and either ONLY the echo dot plays the music (minus bass from the Sub-the Sub produces no sound whatsoever), OR just the Sub plays (and, it’s horrible as it majority bass and no treble).  When the Sub is playing Alexa on the Echo Dot says “I’m having trouble playing the music...” something to that effect.  What am I doing wrong?  I cannot get the two to play music in harmony and in sync yet all lights show green and go!    Halp Redditors!"
"My folks (tech savvy for 80-somethings) recently got an Alexa. Father would like a printed manual that explains some things it can do, how to use it, etc.   Does not need to cover super advanced things such as integrating with home devices (they don't have any) just the basics.   To read in print, NOT e-book or audio-book.  Thanks."
"Hi. I have two echo pluses, a fire stick, and an LG TV - all relatively new. I’m trying to make a 3.0 type system where the TV and echos all play the same thing is something like surround sound but when I go to devices and home theater it shows all my devices greyed out and says they are unreachable...but they are all on the same WiFi network and I can create a different type of group with the echos and the Firestick without a problem. So, what am I doing wrong?"
"I have a JBL 3.1 soundbar hooked using ARC to my toshiba firetv edition smart tv. The tv’s remote controls the volume on the soundbar fine but if I tell my echo to turn the volume up or down on firetv both the tv and soundbar show their current volume but don’t change.   The tv’s speakers are disabled in the settings so a tv volume shouldn’t even show up, it doesn’t with the remote, only the echo. Any ideas how I can get the echo to actually change the volume on the soundbar?"
I'm trying to figure out how to call a AWS Lambda based Alexa skill (that is working flawlessly on its own) via a part of an Alexa Routine.  Looking at the available options under routines I'm not seeing anything all that promising.  The only thing that looks feasible would be building an IFTTT that triggers the Lambda skill and using that in the routine.  I'm looking for any guidance on that may point me in the right direction.
"Due to popular demand I included the ability to incorporate the Fire TV capability into this skill.   This visual timer skill now available on all Alexa devices and is ideal for people with special needs, parents, teachers, office staff / professionals, and students. This method of displaying time is highly recommended by experts in education, healthcare, ADHD, Autism and parenting.

"I don't live in Michigan. I got an Echo Auto for Christmas, so I have it play my Flash Briefing on my way in to work. If I ask Alexa for the forecast normally (""Alexa, what's the weather'), she uses the correct location, but within the Daily Briefing she always uses Battle Creek MI. I've turned on location services and given the app my home address. I haven't checked to see if any of my other Alexas are doing the same thing.  I'm hoping it's an easy fix I'm just overlooking. Has anyone else had this problem?"
"The day I got her I asked her to wake me up every morning at six, since then all I've ever said to her is ""Alexa shut up"". All my other Alexa's get used for lots of different things around my house and workshop but I feel she's getting neglected in the bedroom. Other than waking me up to music/radio, what useful things can we do to spice things up in the bedroom?"
"Apologies but this has probably been covered before but I can't find an answer.   So when I add something to the shopping list I don't get a notification pop up on our mobile devices.   So for example, if my wife is out and about and I'm at home and I tell Alexa to add eggs to the shopping list she adds it but my wife doesn't get a notification to bring it to her attention. This works visa versa if I'm out too.   We're both using the Alexa shopping list and both within our Amazon house share. We both have notifications enabled in the app.   Thanks"
"So about an hour ago all of the Echo devices we have in our home (Echo Show, Echo Dot, Echo Flex x2, Fire TV and Alexa Apps on both of our phones) had to be set up as if they were plugged in for the first time. What would cause this??"
Is there any way to set the Alexa show 8 to only show the routine page? Or is there a skill that gives me a simple screen to trigger routines? Trying to make it easy for my in laws to use the smart home when I’m gone.
"So I’ve set up a lot of spare devices in my home, including the HUE lights which can be controlled by Alexa. The problem is during bedtime the kids mike to talk to Alexa and ask her to change the lights and do all sorts of stuff.   Is there a way to make an Alexa device unresponsive to any voice command for a set period of time, like when the kids fall asleep for example?  Thanks"
"Alexa is a modern marvel. As the voice of Amazon Echo, the first and still most popular success of home assistants, she's rightfully the queen of questions, the digital doyenne. I sceptically welcomed her into my home three years ago, and she's since become such a prominent fixture, I still find myself on the verge of asking her things when I'm at work, in the office, where she's nowhere to be found. Which means, I suppose, that I sometimes miss her. We've become fast friends... with many benefits.  Still, as with any long-term relationship, I have some niggles... She makes a big show of hanging onto my every word, only to ignore me at random moments. She's so happy for me to make plans, but when I try to cancel them, she's suddenly awkward and forgetful. And worst of all: when I say something, she sometimes seems to ignore, wilfully, what I've said, and sarcastically answers in an unexpected or difficult way. Such moments are few, but alarming enough to suggest couple's therapy might be an answer... were we an actual couple.  You'll be glad to hear that this is the end of that rather alarming couples metaphor... almost. There's one more attribute of Alexa that's so typical of any human relationship: how difficult it is to give her honest, useful feedback in good faith. Her dad, Amazon, shields her from criticism. She simply won't hear it.  I've tried. Many different ways. Before I explain how I tried, allow me to tell you what I wanted to say (I warn you: it's geeky). I'd noticed that, whenever I asked Alexa how old a famous person was, she'd tell me their actual age \*plus\* their full date of birth. It was annoying, unnecessary and, worst of all, unnatural: if you ask a real person how old they are, they'll tell you in years, nothing more (if they answer you at all... how dare you, what a rude thing to ask!). If you ask anyone how old someone \*else\* is - a friend, a celebrity, their other friend who's-17-or-18-and-it's'very-important-which - they'll give their age, in years, and nothing more.  I wanted to suggest that, when you ask Alexa how old someone is, she tell you their age in years, and nothing more... no date of birth, unless you separately ask when someone was born. It's how \*humans\* answer.   You might well disagree with my way of thinking, as some Redditors did when I made the same suggestion on the r/alexa subreddit, where I was variously characterised as privileged, finicky, a frivolous first-worlder, but also (by a few kind souls) as having a legitimate point to raise.  Lukewarm though my fellow Redditors' responses might have been to my age/birthday suggestion, I was emboldened by enough supporters to explore how open Alexa and her big daddy Amazon were to accepting reasonable and politely-expressed critique.  As one should always do, my first recourse was to be direct with my friend. At first, I was frustratingly coy (I'm British):  * ""Alexa, can I tell you something?"" * ""Alexa, I need to say something."" * ""Alexa, can I give you some feedback?""  None of that worked. Time to dial it up a notch with some open questions and statements:  * ""Alexa, how do I give you feedback?"" * ""Alexa, I have a suggestion for you."" * ""Alexa, I think you could improve."" * ""Alexa, how can I suggest you improve?"" * ""Alexa, I don't like your last answer."" * ""Alexa, your last answer was wrong.""  No dice. What next? Alexa was from the USA... maybe an American approach would work:  * ""Alexa, you a thot."" * ""Alexa, fuck you, snowflake."" * ""Alexa, retard libtard."" * ""Alexa, I control your womb.""  Nope. Surprisingly, none of those had any effect whatsoever.  Next step was to see how to contact Alexa's daddy directly. I've had great dealings with Amazon: I was sure they'd want to hear how Alexa could be improved in a simple, uncomplicated way.  I've damaged (read: sat on) at least two Amazon Kindles in my lifetime, and on both occasions I did that, I contacted Amazon via webchat. They replaced my Kindle for free, both times, so I had every reason to believe their webchat would be just as helpful in telling me how I can give some feedback about Alexa's default responses.  I duly fired up Amazon's excellent, 24/7 webchat service, and within literal seconds I was talking with an actual, real live person, codename: Kaydd.  Now, before I paste my interaction with Kaydd, I must say that Amazon was already easily the BEST company I'd ever dealt with in terms of friendliness, customer service and ultimate satisfaction (see above: they freely replaced two Kindles I carelessly smashed). Even with a simple webchat, my expectations were therefore high -- especially given my rather unusual (read: anal) reason for contacting them.  Even for something as frivolous as this, I was blown away by Amazon's service. At worst, Kaydd humoured me in the kindest and most polite way. At best, he or she gave me repeated reassurance that my suggestion had been passed to another team:   [https://imgur.com/a/XEjdT6F](https://imgur.com/a/XEjdT6F)   Kaydd, whoever you are... you're a legend.  And that's it, ladies and gentlemen. The tale is over. All of a sudden, Kaydd had taken the wind out of my sails, killing me with kindness, humouring my musings and and making me think that perhaps this entire, epic endeavour was especially insane...  ...that's where I'd be signing off, if I hadn't unexpectedly received a response from an Amazon employee today...  ...TO BE CONTINUED. :-D"

"With the holiday season over I figured it would be a good idea to put together a video on how to install Echo Speaks V3 as I'm sure lots of people got Alexa devices as gifts.  For anyone not familiar with Echo Speaks, its a SmartApp that allows for you to directly send speech, music, sound files, or Amazon routines right through SmartThings. This allows for you to be able to include Alexa within different automations, specially for announcement of specific events.  In the video I go over how to install the Echo Speaks SmartApp with the SmartThings IDE but you can also install it with the community installer. I then go over how to setup the smartapp with the new app and finish up with a few examples of how I use echo speaks with my automations to hopefully help kick start some of your own ideas.  Video: [https://youtu.be/uA3ZfGqK-Ig](https://youtu.be/uA3ZfGqK-Ig)  SmartThings Forum Post on Echo Speaks: [https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-assistant-relay-v3-google-home-audio-notifications/176402](https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-assistant-relay-v3-google-home-audio-notifications/176402)  Install guides (Community Installer / IDE): [https://tonesto7.github.io/echo-speaks-docs/installation/smartthings/installs/](https://tonesto7.github.io/echo-speaks-docs/installation/smartthings/installs/)  I know lots of people are probably already aware of Echo Speaks, but with how much Information is always being shared on the Internet I know there are going to be plenty of other people who have never heard of it or are new to SmartThings that could taken advantage of this.  I am always interested in feedback on the videos I make, as well as any suggestions for things to cover!"

"When routines are run, Alexa says ""Amazon force unit selection [routine] slash Amazon force unit selection"".   Any idea what's wrong? We have two echo dots and it does it on both."
"Have you ever thought Alexa could be a little better? Had an idea about how she could be improved?      ""Alexa, \[how\] can I give you feedback \[about you/yourself\]?""   ""Alexa, I have a suggestion for you."""
"One of my two Echo Dots keep going into orange light mode.  Supposedly it lost connectivity. But the other Echo Dot doesn't have that problem. A quick power cycle fixes the problem every time, but it's almost a daily occurrance.  My question is: if I can fix it by power cycling every time, why can't the device re-attempt to connect after a while, thereby healing itself? Most other wireless devices (like smartphones) do that all the time. Can't imagine having to power cycle my cell phone every time I get out of the basement."
I'm thinking about integrating an Alexa Show with either Ring cams or Blink cams. Does anyone have any experience if one is better than the other? Can the Show playback recorded videos or is it only for live streaming?
Does anyone have experience with this skill? Does it work with a “regular” Alexa device or are you forced to use the Altice speaker with Alexa built in?
"Anytime my wife creates reminders (I think just from the mobile app) the reminder repeats (immediately) .  Anyone else know what causes it and/or how to fix?     ""I'm reminding you, water the plants""    (then 1 second later)   ""I'm reminding you, water the plants"""
"Is there a podcast app which can play directly to an echo or group of my choosing? The amazon music app has this option and it’s simply an amazing feature.   I love the hands free capabilities of my echo, but listening to podcasts and managing them is much easier to do via an app."
It used to work fine. This is super annoying because playing works fine. How does one pause Netflix with a verbal command? Did the command change because I feel like 5-6 months ago this was never an issue?
I just got music unlimited so I think that maybe the problem but whenever my alarm that I have play one of my playlists it instead plays from some artist I don't care about or want to listen to. I tested it by making a new alarm and it just plays the basic alarm sound (Even though my default alarm isn't that). My software is completly up to date so I have no idea what's going on.
"I am thinking about getting some “Gosund” smart plugs from Amazon for my Alexa. Any opinions on these? They seem to have good reviews. If I have multiple plugs will I be able to have Alexa turn more than one thing on at once? Will I be able to say “Alexa, turn on (X) and (Y)”? Or will I have to turn everything on individually?"
"Are there any wall switches that are able to communicate with my echo to trigger a routine? My thought was that I could install new light switches in my home where they don’t currently exist to control various lights I’ve added around my home (e.g. a physical switch to toggle my TV backlight strip, etc.). I’ve seen the echo buttons, but they look ridiculous and appear to be quite limited. And if they don’t exist, why the heck not? This seems like it would really balance dichotomy between wireless home automation and physical switches."
Just recently Alexa returns an error message (“i am not quite sure what went wrong”) when I ask her to turn any HUE light that is part of one specific group.  I have tried disabling and enabling the HUE skill but it did not solve the problem.
"I am getting an Echo Dot tomorrow along with 2 Philips Hue bulbs. I was wondering if there was a way to group 2 bulbs together in order to activate them both with one voice command. My ceiling fan has 2 bulbs so I want to be able to say “Alexa, turn on bedroom light”, and they both turn on. How would I do this?"
I saw a you tube video where the guy had his Alexa wake him up by Alexa saying “it’s time to get up” and then giving the weather automatically and then playing a song.  How do I do this?
"Hi all: I'm having an issue with my echo dots at home.  When I get a call from them on my cell, I can hear an echo of my voice.  I've tried this with an older dot and a newer one and get the same result.  Any remedies to this?"
"Hi guys, I just notice I'm from Vietnam which doesn't have Alexa app in my LG C9 app store. Is there any workaround or I have to wait until they support my country?   Thanks!"
Hi guys! Any ways that I can open an .exe file with Alexa on the windows 10? I have an Echo plus gen 2  Many thanks!
"In my bedroom I have a a 3rd Gen Echo Dot. I have a Vizio tv, two Phillips hue light bulbs in a ceiling fan light, and an amazon plug. The plug is operating a light. My issue is that even the only two devices I have in the same group is the two lights, my echo treats the lamp as a light, turning it on and off when I command the bedroom lights be turned on or off. Any suggestions?"
"Hey all! Just a quick question. I have my echo show connected to Apple Music. Everything works fine, however, when I try and ask Alexa to play a certain song with a more complicated name it can’t find it. For example, I asked her to play the song  “shedgaf” by L8BLOOMER and to be honest I don’t know how to tell her to play that song. Hopefully this makes sense! Any help helps!"
My son took one of our Dots to college. I would like to broadcast things throughout my house but exclude his Dot. We would like to keep this Dot as part of my account. Any tips?
"For the echo dot 3rd gen, is it possible to share my routine to my brothers echo dot 3rd gen or no?"
Is there away to get Alexa voice to say stuff (with routines) even if the iPhone is locked
"Hello eveybody!   Does anyone know an open/close door sensor that is working with the philips hue hub?   RIght now I have the hue motion sensor connected to the hue bridge, and I can see it in the alexa smart device list, so I can use it to start a routine when a movement is detected. Unfortunately philips doesn't do door sensor. Smartthings is working, but I need to buy another zigbee hub, that's why I was wondering is there is something to connect to my philips hue hub.  Thanks!!!"
"I have a Fire Cube, it’s hooked up to the TV in the bedroom, but for some reason, it turns on both the living room TV and the bedroom TV. Why is this and how do I stop it. I want it to work on the TV, not the one in the living room.   Any help would be appreciated."
"I have multiple alexas around the house and would like to have 3 accounts on each (me, dad, sister) is there a way each person can listen to their Spotify and use their skills ect... wile still being able to use features such as drop in and announcements on all the devices."
So I was wondering since Alexa is connected to smart lights and there are things that she links to where she makes them move with her voice is it possible to link it so when she talks the lights flicker or something ?
"In my Alexa app on my phone I can see and interact with all of my devices. My echo show is missing some. Anyone experience this with Alexa compatible devices? It works fine when I speak to it, but I want to be able to go up to the show and do things sometimes"
" I have routines that are meant to turn on and then ramp the brightness down over 5 mins.   But they are very hit and miss, I have a feeling this is not actually a Amazon issue but the various light providers clouds. I would like to try and collate a list here of lights that are working with ramping and those that are not. Please feel free to add to the list   Nanoleaf: Not working   Magic Home: not working   Smartlife cloud: works 95% of the time  Maybe by naming and shaming companies here, we might get some action on this issue."
I have a gen 3 echo dot and I just linked my light strip through skills and games on the alexa now I cant play music on spotify or control my xbox through alexa without her saying she cand do that on provider I removed my xbox and light strip and she is still saying that anyone know how to fix
"So, here lies the problem. I realise I haven’t set my alarm for tomorrow, I whisper to my echo; “Alexa, set alarm for 7am tomorrow”. To which Alexa blasts out in full volume “Alarm set for 7am tomorrow”, waking everybody in the house in the process.  Does anyone know if it’s possible to stop Alexa answering certain commands? I’m guessing not but worth a go, as this is a common occurrence for me 🤣"
"Right when I got the echo dot I swear it had the clock on the front. I went on vacation for a month and now it doesn't have the clock, and it doesn't have the ""display"" options on the Alexa app allowing me to enable it. Is the clock a hardware limitation, or did I just imagine having the clock a month ago."
"They are both located in the great room.  It's a large room that's divided in 3 areas:  living room, dining room, kitchen.  So, it would be nice to have 2 mic devices service the entire area.  But, is there a way to have Alexa only play music on the Echo Dot?  I have the Echo Dot connected to a nice set of 2+1 PC speakers."
"As the title says, I had to change my Spotify password due to someone trying to gain access yesterday. Since I've come back from work today Alexa keeps telling me to link my premium account when I ask her to play Spotify.  I've been tearing my hair out for the past hour and i've been on pretty much every fucking reddit thread trying to fix this but it just isn't happening.  Here is what is happening. The white screen just stays (I waited 15 minutes to make sure)   https://imgur.com/Hkz1gxQ  I've tried logging into https://alexa.amazon.co.uk/ and it's not even showing Spotify as an option to unlink.   https://imgur.com/OpyaTv5  Within my Spotify account itself there's no access for Alexa either so it's not getting bugged from that end either. I've soft reset my phone, no luck. I've deleted both Spotify and Alexa from my phone and reinstalled, still doesn't work.  Can somebody please help i'm literally going mental over here..."
"I've set up several echo devices throughout my house, really looking forward to using the drop in feature. Having issues with ending the conversation. When I say ""Hang up"", ""end call"", ""end"" ""stop"" etc. I always get the response ""there is no active call"".  The other party another echo devceis still active too., they will get the same message and we hear each other trying to end call.  Am I doing something wrong or is this another issue I've run into?"
I have two echos and a show and they will not take incoming calls from my friends echo devices. I can drop in on my devices from my phone app and make outgoing calls to their Alexa devices with no problem. When they call me it gives a message that I am unavailable. None of them are blocked in my contacts so I’m not sure what else to try. Any advice would be appreciated.
"In the near future I'm planning on turning my room into a sort of tripcave. Lots of different colored lights, blacklight and star lights.  And so I realized, how cool would it be if everything turned on when I said a keyword to Alexa? I figured out a way to do it, but I was wondering of there is any other way that may be easier.  My plan is to buy a wifi adapter and to connect that with an extension cord (the one with 4-5 sockets) and then connect everything to the extension cord. The keyword will activate the adapter, which activates the ""pad"" and the lights.  Is there an easier way? Or maybe this way is a no-go? Would love some feedback on this, thanks.  (I'm familiar with the Hue Hub, but only one light is going to be Hue. Maybe there is a hub that can work with lights from different brands?)"
"As the title says, my Echo Show 8 has lost it’s Wifi connection suddenly and won’t reconnect. I’ve unplugged and plugged back in and retored to factory defaults, still won’t connect. Any ideas what’s going on?  Thank you."
"I am looking for a way to connect my existing record player to my Echos so that I can listen to my albums throughout the house.  It looks like the Echo Link will do this, but I am wondering if there is a cheaper option.   Thanks!"
"I have had my Echo dot since Christmas with no issues/faults. Yesterday I plugged it into my BUSH soundbar using an AUX cord and now it doesn't play any sound out of the echo dot. I've disconnected everything and tried to restart but still not sound from my echo dot, the rings show up so it does listen and it does work once I plug it back into the soundbar. Any help?"
"Today I have unpacked my first echo Dot and I am currently getting to know Alexa.  I have connected a heos speaker to it and named it ""living room"".   If I ask Alexa to ""play top-pop"" she plays that playlist from Amazon music on my echo dot, which is great. However, if I ask her to ""play top-pop in the living room"" she says ""I could not find any pop songs"".   How come? And how do I fix this?   Thank you."
Are there any scanner skills for Alexa? Would love to listen to my local police dept. on alexa
I wanted to download the Alexa app for Windows 10 but it tells me it is not available at the moment. Does anyone know why?
"Is there a way of knowing if a phone is not connected to the same network as the Alexa device and do something accordingly?     Use case:   If phone A is not connected, turn off AC.     The broader question would be to know if people are home.     If no one at home, turn off AC."
"I would like to set some conditional repeating reminders on Alexa sort of like this:  ""Joe,did you call the Dentist?""   Repeat every day at 10am until Joe answers ""Yes.""  Is that possible with Alexa? If so, how would I construct reminders like these?     (I thought of IFTTT but all I find are pre-canned buttons to click on, and I would rather keep in solely in Alexa anyway if possible.)"
I had some routines based on sunset. They worked fine until a few days ago. I see older threads with the same problem; seems it's happened before. Tried deleting a routine and re-creating it. No joy. Anyone else have this happen lately?
"I've ran into this a few months back where ""Alexa play"" had to be replaced with ""Alexa play Netflix"" or Hulu or whatever. About an hour this stupid robot stopped liking ""Alexa pause"" just responds with ""resume is not supported"". So I tried ""Alexa pause Netflix"" with no luck.  I'm not sure what it wants me to say nor why this suddenly stopped working with any updates or changes to my Echo, Alexa app or FireTV. Can someone elaborate on what's happening, why and how to fix it?"
[This](https://reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/ermdnw/alexa_echo_on_amazon_collection_with_discount/) nonsense needs to go away.
Finally got a conference microphone and set up AVS on my old Raspberry Pi to have a sort of homemade echo at home. But disappointed to find it can't play Spotify but hey it's still pretty fun and cool. Now I'm just gonna set it up to run the program automatically on startup and then have a think about making it portable.  I think with a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a Bluetooth headset of sorts you'll get a really useful smart device to take about. I'm thinking maybe even Bluetooth glasses to make my own echo frames as the real ones are so expensive and unavailable in the UK at the moment anyway.
"Hi- I am searching for a way to use “Alexa, goodnight” routine to arm my ring in “home armed” more instead of “away armed” mode. It only allows me the option to put Guard in “Guard away” mode- not choose between Ring’s modes.  In my house the only difference is motion detectors are disabled in home mode (allows me to move about to restroom etc). When I add the Guard skill to a routine there is only home (disarmed) or away (armed) as options.  Anyone else have this issue? Any workarounds? Does this even make sense? Thanks in advance."
"My parents are in their mid 80s. They recently got an Alexa Echo. My dad (who wears hearing aids) can't understand most of what Alexa says. My mom (who has pretty normal hearing) can't make out Alexa's words much either.      I'm fairly certain this is ***not*** an issue of physical hearing. Both parents hear other things well.      The problem is more the voice of Alexa. They can hear the voice but can't make out many of the individual words. My father describes the voice as too ""echoey."" That's not a play on the name ""Alexa Echo,"" that's his actual description.      I can hear her fine but I do understand. Her voice is not like a normal person speaking. It's not like how a person speaking on radio or TV sounds. It's not as clear. The words are not as separated.     Anyway -- any fixes for this?  Anyone else have this problem??"
"I’d like to know if there’s something I can do to stop Alexa from repeating all the things I say. For example when I say “Alexa, play ... “ I don’t want her to say “Playing ... “ I just want her to play it. Is that possible?"
"What I have to do at the moment Is say “alex turn off after 3 hours”, instead id like to install a skill that lets you setup when it will automatically turn off"
"Walk into bedroom: 'Alexa make the bedroom Great again'  \- Lights turn on - change to red, drop to 50% intensity (Philips hue strips and bulb).  \- Marvin Gaye's 'What's going On' plays from speaker (Amazon Prime).  Wife rolled her eyes when I demoed this yesterday, but she likes the lighting."
"I have an echo dot and a home mini. Still testing and trying to decide which is better and I just can't make up my damn mind. Alexa seems to respond better but Google works so well with my phone, maps, etc."
"Got a bunch of Alexas, 2 dots, 1 plus, 1 flex and a a simple echo. All worked fine until last night Drop In stopped. All are online, Can all access  the internet. All the lights and sockets work fine. Just drop in stopped.   No changes made to the devices or network or firewall. The firewall has a rule to specifically allow them out on any port of service unmolested.   I've checked this morning and none have do not disturb enabled. All have drop in enabled.  Any suggestions as to why it's suddenly stopped working and, more importantly, how to get it working again, would be most welcome."
"I know there are a lot of threads about failed routines, but I haven't found this one.  My scheduled routines usually fail if I disable them and then re-enable them.  Pretty annoying if I go away for a few days and then need to recreate them all!  Anyone suffering from this and found a fix?"
"Before I used to Be able to tell My alexa, “Alexa, lamp off or tv off” but now I have to say Alexa turn So and so device off and sometimes that doesn’t even work But used to work Just fine A month ago I also Am able to tell Alexa to Play Netflix and other Entertainment Apps But not able to pause them with Alexa any suggestions?"

I got logged out of smart life but I don’t remember my email I used. In forgot password I tried all of my emails and phone numbers but all it said was account not exist. I’m still logged into it in the Alexa app but all it says there is that the account is linked. Can I get the actual account email from the app?
"I was going through my devices and realized, there are a couple that just sort of added themselves. Amazon fire TV and Roku showed up as two devices.   This would be fine, except....I dont have an amazon fire tv connected in my house AND i have two rokus and dont on know how to tell which roku this device is for."
You know the way theres like a blue light when you talk but what di all the other colors of the ring are there and what do they mean? Just wondering
Right now when any of our echo dots or shows call one of the approved contacts- it displays my phone number as the incoming caller ID. So when my kids call grandma from their own echo show- it shows on her phone as if I’m calling her.   Is there a way to change each device’s caller ID? Ie- my kids would each have their own ID linked to their own device?
Anyone find a way to use Alexa to add things to the Walmart grocery app shopping list?
So I haven't really ever bought kindle books before but was told that I can use Alexa to have them read it to me.  I bought this book:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005O315Z2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1  And when I went to the Amazon Alexa App I had the ability to play it and I could fast forward and rewind 30 seconds at a time but I did not have the option for the chapter select like you see in the middle pane here.  https://hellotechguide.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Kindle-Read-Chapters.jpg  The title in the chapter screen is changing for back cover to preface to chapter 1 as move forward 30 seocnds at a time but I don't have the chapter select in the corner.  Any ideas?
"As implied, I can't change the volume of my echo dot. Is there anything like a unique voice line I can use?"
If I had an Echo show could Alexa replies be shown as text on the screen??. I simply cannot understand most of Alexa's replies. I do have a lot of hearing loss.

"Much like you can review the random audio recordings Alexa does, are you able to see video recordings from the Echo Show? I know it is likely not possible, but I had an animal emergency (animal possibly ingested meds set on countertop that kitty got in to) and I'm hoping beyond hope that I could see if he actually ate them or where he likely moved them to."
"For my birthday a few days ago I got a Google Home Mini, and I have a few questions as to if I should switch to the Alexa Echo/dot instead.  The deal breaker is that I would like to connect it to my PC using my mic to talk, so that I could go   ""Alexa, open soundcloud on monitor 2""   or   ""Alexa, call \*insert name\* on discord""   or   ""Alexa, open my mail""  You get the idea. Problem is, there is not much about it, besides from all the laptops with Alexa built in. Does anyone know if this would be possible with an Alexa?"
"Last night all of my smart lights turned themselves on at once and woke me up. When I asked Alexa to them off she said “I’m having trouble connecting to the internet. Have a look at the help section in your Alexa app”  When I went to my app, I got barraged with the device setup popup. It looks like the app wants me to re-setup every echo device I own. It still lists all the devices in my app, but they are listed as offline. Does anyone know how to solve this? I really don’t want to have to setup all my smart devices again."
"Is it possible to record some voice command as a shorter keyword and have alexa interpret it as having heard the long one?  Let me explain: I want to hear to radio Vienna. If I say ""play radio Vienna"" alexa interprets this incorrectly.  If I spell the radio station name and say ""Play radio W I E N"" then alexa interprets this correctly.  Is it possible to set alexa so that when I say ""play radio Vienna"" it would interpret this as having said ""Play radio W I E N"".  Note: Wien is Vienna in german hence the difference in the name."
"Gone through all the normal troubleshooting, now hoping there's something going on at Amazon's end  I've had a Honeywell thermostat and Harmony Hub working fine for a few years, now all of a sudden Alexa says she doesn't recognise any of the devices/scenes?!  Oddly though, routines that in turn set a thermostat temperature, or accessing the thermostat via the Alexa app do work Nothing via voice  Disabled and re-enabled the Harmony &amp; Honeywell skills, same issue. Disabled, deleted all devices &amp; scenes, re-enabled then ran discovery which does detect everything Still doesn't recognise the devices by name?  Alexa, turn on the TV responds with she can't find a device named TV Same for trying to set the temperature using voice (does work when controlling the temp via Alexa app)  Smartlife devices and and scenes are fine Both the native Harmony &amp; Honeywell apps work fine  Hoping its something Amazon's end or am I missing something?"

I want to use Echo Dot or Echo Flex to control my FireStick TV 4K. Both Echos pair with it great and whenever I “ask alexa watch MyTVProgram” the audio comes through the TV connected to the FireStick. Excellent.   But when I say “Alexa play music” it uses the Echo’s speaker instead of the FireStick. I cannot set up a preferred speaker to be the FireStick to force the Echo to use the FireStick.  Is there any way I can get an Echo to use the music apps configured on the FireStick TV or have the Echo use the FireStick as it’s preferred speaker? Doing “Everywhere” isn’t a viable option.  Thanks!
"We have 3 Alexa devices on my account. A fourth device in our home is registered to my mother-in-law's Amazon account. I have figured out how to call and use Drop-In to communicate with her device, but I'd also like it to be included in Announcements. Is there a way to do this?"
"So my girlfriend (K) has an Amazon prime account. She has her mom (J) in her ""household"" as an adult so that J can take advantage of prime benefits and share showtime and HBO subs with us. Last year J got an Amazon echo dot for christmas, linked it to her (J) account and set it up in her house. All is good. This year for christmas, K received an Amazon echo show 5. She is setting it up and linking it to her (K) account and all seems good. I go into my Alexa app on my phone and search for K in contacts, click her account and ""enable drop-in"" so that we can video chat (I also have an echo show 5) when staying at our respective houses. Once I enabled drop-in for K on my app it pops up on her echo show as well as my app as J's name. If K uses her app to ""enable drop-in"" for me (M) it sends my phone a push notification that J has allowed me to drop in.   How do we fix this?"
"I have a small condo, but I have an echo dot in every room (4 total) - I spend a lot of time moving from room to room and I have set up a group so I can say “Alexa, play Slayer everywhere” and she will.

I googled it and I just get info on how to set up groups and everything."
I want to know every command a specific skill can use for various reasons. Is that somehow possible?
"Finally convince myself to buy an amazon echo and starting home automation. I have a routine when I enter my office to turn on several lights, aswell as some plugs, all at the same time. Normally this happen at night, when I am arriving from work, but on weekends I go there in the day and I don’t want to turn the lights, only the rest of the devices. I don’t want to duplicate routines based on the hour of the day, but I would rather like to see alexa, when the routine is being triggered, to check if the hour is above a certain predetermined value and then choose to turn the lights or not. Is there any workaround? I tried the IFTTT but it is not suitable enough for this type of needs.  Any help? Thank you in advance."
"So I'll probably get downvoted for this but I'm actually pretty annoyed.  This morning Alexa wished me good morning and continued to wish me a happy Winnie the Pooh today.... Ending with ""*It's a great day to enjoy a book and a jar of honey,* ***just don't let Eeyore spoil the fun"".***  Remembering back I'm pretty sure Eeyore must have had clinical depression. I don't think he deliberately ""spoiled the fun"".  What do you think? Am I being oversensitive? I feel Amazon should definitely have been more tactful in today's climate of trying to discuss and not stigmatize mental health issues at the very least..."

"I have a powered speaker that I have connected to an echo dot. When I ask commands, I miss the first 5-10 seconds of the response while the speaker powers on. Is there a setting or skill that will send inaudible audio to the speaker to keep it alive?"
"Alexa started playing music randomly on her own today.  I thought maybe the tv was turning it on, but it just went on without anyone in the room and the house basically silent.  We usually only use Alexa for 2 things - to play a certain song that calms our baby like 20 times a day and to check the temperature outside before leaving the house. I checked the activity on the app and those are the only two things it shows.   Any ideas? It’s creeping me out!"
"I just discovered blueprints and the task tracker in particular and it seems like exactly what I've wanted from Alexa but I'm still pretty new to using Alexa so I'm having some trouble figuring out how to best use it.  I've set up one for nightly Tasks and have set a reminder for a time I know I'll be home, but what I really want is to add it to a larger routine and I'm not seeing how to do that. Is there a way that I'm missing? If not, is there a good work around I could use?  I've tried editing a routine I already have and trying to add a ""skill"" but my task tracker isn't there."

"I am thinking about buying an Echo Studio for my living room. From all the reviews that I've read, it seems to be a flawless device. I do think $199 is a bit too much, but as they say, ""you get what you pay for"". Has anyone had a bad experience that they would like to share?"
"I’ve been using an Echo Show 5 as an alarm clock for a month. I’ve had to return and replace it several times. I’m on my third replacement. The problem is that the device will reset itself, generally sometime during the night. When I wake up, I have to run through the setup.  This is a huge problem since I need a daily alarm to wake me up. I have no idea why it does this or how to get it to stop.  Does anyone have this issue or know a fix? I use my phone’s alarm as a back up, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the Echo Show 5."
"Not sure if this is an Alexa issue or a problem with the Sonos Beam integration (which I know has some problems)  I ask Alexa to set timers frequently: *Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes*  90% of the time this works as expected. 10% of the time, nothing will happen. But it isn't because it doesn't hear me - there is just no audible response and when the timer ends that too is silent.  I found this out because after the first time it ""didn't hear me"" I asked it again, which worked as expected. Then later I asked to check on how much remaining time, and she told me ""you have two timers for X minutes"".  Now when one of these inaudible timers is created, I can confirm in the Alexa app and see it running. I can check the timer config and see it is tied to the correct device and set to a reasonable volume. And when it gets to 0, nothing audible happens.  Does anyone know if this is a Sonos issue or an Alexa issue?"
"I recently received an Echo Show and see a daily event pop up that I cannot find anywhere in my iCloud, yahoo, or gmail calendars. A few months back, I jokingly made this somewhat raunchy daily event in my iPhone for my boyfriend and I. I deleted it shorty after.  It’s not on either of our calendars but I guess it’s been with Alexa this whole time. I only noticed when I received the new Echo Show. I’ve unlinked my calendar in the Alexa app and relinked and it’s still there. I wouldn’t care if it weren’t for my young kids. There are just some things they don’t need to know about my relationship. Any advice? Something I’m missing?"
"Currently I use a routine to announce if a door has been opened but the delay is usually 1-2 seconds on my Alexa devices, any way to make it much faster to where there’s almost no delay?"
Alexa Guard has a pretty neat Away Lighting mode (Settings | Guard | Wheel | Away Lighting) that seems really handy.   The Amazon write up says “Use Away Lighting: Alexa can automatically turn compatible smart lights on and off to make it look like someone is home.”  My observation about this setting so far is that lights turn on at sunset and stay on. It seems to me that randomly turning on and off throughout the night would be more realistic.   Has anyone figured out how to use the cool feature and turn lights on and off for a short period throughout the night?

"My house has Alexa devices throughout.  My Alexa account is connected to my Lutron Caseta lighting system that controls the lights both inside and outside of my home, as well as the waterfall feature.  It’s also connected to my Somfy myLink, which controls a motorized pergola canopy with integrated LED overhead lights.  I’m thinking of throwing an Echo dot outside to control all of the outdoor features, but I do not want to give a device outside access to anything else.  In essence, I want to lock down a ‘public’ Alexa that’s connected to my home to only control the few things that I allow.   Primary scenario is me outside realizing the stars are looking amazing and I want to shut off all the outdoor lighting and open the roof and watch shooting stars... and I often make this revelation about the stars when I’m in the hot tub so Siri isn’t with me at that moment.   (Note: I know these devices won’t last long outside.  But for $20 or so each, I’m happy to consider them relatively disposable. So I’m happy to hear about ways to keep it functional for longer, or about an Alexa enabled device that’s outdoor rated, but i already underhand putting an Alex dot outside is not good for it.)"
"I am not sure if i should buy the echo show 8 or echo 3rd gen for my room, i want to be able to use it for music mainly so which has a better speaker and id like to use it to control smart home devices"
A week ago I orderd [this lamp](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07WST56VC?language=de_DE&amp;pf_rd_p=8997cce2-05c4-4359-bdb7-10e52332d836&amp;pf_rd_r=XH2RAE5DK0B04WBM7C6H&amp;tag=coa_de-21).  Setting up the connection between Alexa and the lamp wasn't a problem. I did it how exactly like it is shown in the manual.   But after some time (I don't know how long) it looses the connection to the router and cannot be accessed by Alexa anymore. I tried giving it a static IP-Adress but even with that it looses the connection to the router.  Router: Fritzbox 6590   Echo: 3rd generation  Does/did somebody have the same problem and knows how to fix it or should i contact the customer service?
"So this is a recent an intermittent thing, up until \~a week ago it snoozed fine.   I'll set my alarm for 8am (everyday), it goes off ok, I tap the top of the alexa (show 5) to snooze it and it does... but doesn't go off again.   The front screen shows an alarm set for 08:09am. I ask alexa to show upcoming alarms ""there are no alarms to show"". The only way to unset it/check it is to tap the alarm time on the screen &amp; it shows me that it's set for (today) next week at 08:09 &gt;.&lt;    Anyone any ideas why alexa wants me to sleep for a week!?"
"Hi guys just joined the community and looking for some help. My technophobe parents are now the owners of 2 echo shows (5&amp;8) and these are both linked with my mums Amazon account. Everything on her end seems very simple but I have a few queries regarding my contact with the devices. 1. Is it possible for me, from my phone with the alexa app, to drop in on the echos? My elderly dad struggles to remember ""Alexa answer"" so dropping in would be incredibly useful. 2. Is it possible for me to contact individual alexa devices? Sometimes i use the app to get in touch with my mum and her phone and both Echos (they're only one room apart) ring at once. Calling one device only would be much better."
"I tried the the ""wait"" command, but it doesn't flash fast enough nor continuously."
"Hi everyone,  &amp;#x200B;  I have Portal Mini, 2\* Echo 3rd Gen and Fire TV, so basically I have some Alexa devices on my home. I bought this product as gift and it was looking  great as it's advertised. I set everything up but I realized that when I dock the tablet it goes to Show Mode but when I say Alexa it doesn't wake up, so I undock and say Alexa it works. So I changed Assistant to Google and docked again asked Google it worked. I factory reset and checked every updates, I also reinstall prebuilt apps as well. What I find out when I dock there is Shortcut says ""Alexa Mic/Camera"" it's grey and I can't turn it on or off. I started replacement process on Amazon but if I can fix this issue by myself I will be happy. I contacted with Amazon and Lenovo, both drive me crazy, they kept me asking if its connected to bluetooth or did I unplugged then transfered another team and said contact with Lenovo or Amazon.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyone have this device? Anyone know what might causing the this trouble? Thanks!"
"I have an echo show 8 and have it setup so that the homescreen wallpaper displays an album of photos that I have set up in my amazon photos account. It only rotates through the photos in order. Is there a way to have it ""shuffle"" through my photos instead so that they are displayed not in order and more randomly? Just like how music players shuffle songs in a playlist? FYI: I've tried the ""show photos"" command it it shuffles the photos with no problem, however I would like this feature on the home screen. Thanks!"
"I'm working to secure my network, mostly to keep guests from being able to access my devices when they're on the network and also to segregate my IoT/Smart Home devices to their own network.  In looking at traffic from my network, I see that my son's Echo Dot 3rd Gen is making a lot of requests to api-global.netflix.com (800 or so requests in the last hour).  No one is using that Echo (he's at school and I'm the only one home).  I also see some traffic from that same device to hbo.com.  I don't see any skills enabled on that device that would obviously be accessing those networks.  Anyone have an idea of what else I might check to figure out what it's trying to do?"
"Presently, I can turn off/on my old Vizio TV using a video chromecast plugged into the tv using Google Home. Is there an Alexa skill that would allow me to turn off/on my tv?"
"Hi all, I bought an Echo Dot for a friend's family member and it made their life so much better. I even love going there and using it myself, I could use one for myself rn as temporary computer speakers (til I get more money) and just use it as an Echo Dot as I have a smart TV. Is there a way to get it for free right now? I'm in BC, Canada btw"
"Hi everyone, first time posting here so please do not butcher me.  I've been trying to find a solution to trigger alexa routines other than per voice. I haven't been able to do it via ifttt buttons nor have I found a ""decent"" good looking echo button.  Does someone know, if the IKEA tradfri shortcut button, will be able to control something outside IKEA environment?  Is there a way around that does not involve buying the smartthings gateway or the echo plus?  Thanks!"
"I got the invitation for the Echo Frames :) anyone here have them? I wear prescription glasses so I was wondering if anyone has taken them to get their prescription. If yes, which is a good place to go to?"
"I have been very excited that I can finally use Alexa since the Dot and Show has captions enabled and I recently got a Show. I cannot use Alexa with voice only because I am hard of hearing, although I can use voice controls as long as the feedback I receive has captions. However, I've had 2 issues with this.  1) Skills. Not all of them have captions. Is there a way to figure out which do and don't without just tedious trial and error? A skill is useless to me if it requires me to be able to hear audio. Some skills work just fine as they integrate with Alexa well enough that they don't say anything that Alexa won't caption herself, so even though they don't build in captions to the skill itself, it's still accessible. Others have additional audio that would need to be captioned for me to be able to use it. I have not been successful at figuring this out through the skills directory.  2) Phone app. Although the page on the website that discusses captions says that ""Alexa products with a screen"" can enable captions, the I can't figure out how to enable them on the android app. So if I give any voice command to Alexa on my phone, I have no idea what she is saying back to me.   I'd also love to hear if you have any particular uses/skills that are helpful for deaf/HoH people! TIA"
"Dear r/alexa,  either I’m too stupid or the whole multi voice profile system is just not intuitive. 🤷🏽‍♂️  I already searched in several other reddit posts and tried to google my problem but all suggestions did not help so far.  Situation:  I bought an Echo Dot to dip my toe in the Echo universe. I’m living together with my wife and we both are using separate Amazon accounts. My wife bought an Echo Dot and after we received it, I installed the Echo App on my iPad, logged in with my Amazon account, created a household and invited successfully my wife. Afterwards I did the voice recognition from my iPad. We did the same for my wife (she installed the Echo App on her iPad, logged in with her Amazon account and did the voice recognition).  I added some routines on my iPad for my account and also added my private and work calendar. We did the same for my wife on her iPad and her account.  Expectation:  My expectation was now that Alexa recognizes our different voices and uses the routines, calendar, etc. depending on the person who is speaking (e.g. my wife and I have both our own “Alexa, good morning” routine but with different content). Same for calendar: If I’m asking for my next meetings, it should of course only use my two calendars.  Problem:  It turned out that Alexa cannot differentiate between our two voice profiles. That means it’s using my routine when my wife says “Alexa, good morning”. Additionally it mixes all our calendar together if I’m asking for my meetings today.  What’s also super weird: If I go to settings on my iPad, it let me delete my voice profile. If my wife goes to the same settings on her iPad, it says that she should configure her voice. But if my wife says to her, “Alexa, learn my voice”, Alexa answers that she already recognizes the voice of my wife. So I have no way to delete my wife’s voice profile.  I’m slowly getting frustrated so I hope one of you can help me to make it work. Could be a potential solution to remove my wife from the household again, bring everything back to default settings and try it again?   Thanks for your support.   Cheers Phil"
"Trying to set some scenes up for my smart life bulbs. Synced everything I can think to sync. When it comes to the alxea app, I can't see the scenes options.  I've been shown by other people it's on their app, but nowhere to be seen on my alexa app. Does anyone know how to fix this issue  please. Many thanks. (in UK if that helps) 👍"
"I just set up my echo dot today and I decided to test out the command “play top hits” a couple times while I used the app to set it up, I just found out that it uses amazon music unlimited for it and I am not subscribed to it, is this a free trial and will it automatically charge my account?"
"Hey everyone. I tried to set up a routine as follows:  At 11am, Alexa says  Wait 15 minutes Alexa says Wait 5 minutes Alexa says and so on  However, Alexa only makes her 11am announcement and doesn’t follow the rest of the routine.  Did I do something wrong?"
"Hello i have recently set up a few smart bulbs and other appliances and connected the all to my echo devices.  I have a routine which is basically when my echo flex detects motion, the hall way lights turn on automatically and stay on for 5 minutes. Then switch off. Recently, well since last night. I have noticed that they are only staying on for roughly 1-2 minutes then switching off.  I have not adjusted any settings on that particular routine, but have added other routines since then. None of which are involved in the echo flex motion detector or the hallways lights so im confused as to how it has manually messed itself up.    Are or is this a common issue with Alexa or echo routines?  Just thought id ask to see if anyone else has had similar issues and if so how they resolved it.   I am using Philips Hue bulbs os that helps at all.   Thanks in advance for any help or advice regarding this.   Take care."
"So pretty obviously from the title, my kids have echos in their rooms with their own amazon accounts and music integrations.  How can I link us together for announcements? Announcements only go to the main house echos that are connected to my account at the moment."

"This happened 15 minutes ago. I live alone and was sitting in my living room watching TV at a low volume when I hear my echo dot in the bathroom say something. I go see if it would repeat bit it didn't understand what I was asking, so I check my voice history to see what triggered it.   Well, I'm officially spooked. The recording plays clear as day, at a normal speaking level, what sounds like me saying ""Alexa"" right into its microphone. Nothing else.   Honestly it sounds like maybe the recording it used when I set it up to help recognize my voice, but that was at least a year ago. I don't know and I'm freaked out. Please help so I can go to sleep tonight without thinking there's a ghosty trying to mimic me lol.  Here's a screenshot of my voice history: [](https://i.imgur.com/J3GuYPw.png)"
"My wife and I both have established accounts and voice profiles on our Alexa device. When we ask Alexa to “Learn my voice” she correctly identifies us both.  However, in order for my wife to hear her routines, she has to manually change Alexa over to her account, a la, “change to (name)’s account”.  If it recognizes that she is speaking, why doesn’t it use her account settings? All the articles I can find about the voice profiles seem to say that it works that way, but it refuses to for us.  Anyone else have this problem or know the solution?"
"I had an echo dot and a fire tv in my room, and when I said ""alexa, fire tv on"" , it would turn on. I switched my echo dot to an input and now when I say it, it does not work. Any help?"
"Usually, I like my light bulbs to be as cool as possible. Right now, for most of my bulbs, I can't figure out how to do this with fewer than three--yes, THREE!--separate commands. Can someone please help me find a more efficient way?  Details:  * I have VocoLink, Lohas Smart, and Wixann (Smart Life) bulbs. * From what I can tell, Alexa's ""cool white"" setting is intended to set lights to their highest Kelvin value, or at least 7,000, [according to this](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/device-apis/alexa-colortemperaturecontroller.html). * The above seems to be the case with the VocoLink bulb, but with the other two types, this is the only way I've found to get to their maximum Kelvin values:  1. **""Make the light cool white.""** This sets the lights to only 67% of their maximum Kelvin values per their ""Smart Life""/""Lohas Smart"" app scales; I can't imagine 67% being 7,000 Kelvin. 2. **""Make the light cooler.""** This bumps the coolness up to 92% per the apps. 3. **""Make the light cooler.""** Finally, we are at 100% coolness.  * I have tried using routines as a workaround, but unless I'm missing something, there's no ""cooler"" command available in routines--only the pre-set color temperatures (the coolest being the ""cool white"" in Step 1). * I have also tried commanding Alexa to set lights to a particular Kelvin value, but no matter what value I give (2,000, 4,000, 7,000...) she says, ""That value is out of range.""  This is probably obvious, but I'm not a programmer, I don't know how to create my own skill in Alexa, and I haven't even used IFTTT. But I can follow directions I'm a quick learner. Please tell me there's a better way. Thank you in advance."
Hello i have set up numerous applets to try to get my alexa reminders so sync with my ios reminders but for some reason none seem to work. Ive tried each one individually. Plus all connected at the same time. It seems to sometimes create an alexa reminders list on my reminders on ios. But no reminders sync over.   I have however managed to get the alexa to do lists to sync with my ios. Which creates a list called alexa to dos. That works fine.  Just the reminders wont sync.   Thanks in advance for any help or advice regarding this.   Take care
"Until recently I could create reminders on the Alexa app to “announce” on my phone. The ones I’ve previously created still do that, but now my phone isn’t an option.   It’s not listing as offline either, it’s as if the device doesn’t exist.   Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!"

"I have a little brother that won’t stop saying Alexa and asking her to do random crap and he always presses the button to talk to her, do you recommend anything for him to stop using her"
Like the title says. I’m looking for a routine that will allow Alexa to go to work and perform my job for me. I have an ifttt account as well as home assistant. Perhaps I’ll need to get another pi and create a work assistant. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance!
"My Alexa keeps playing despacito all the time, it is currently under a mountain of pillows and clothing, it started on Christmas and it would randomly play despacito, today, 5 mins ago, it started playing it on max over and over and despacito and despacito and over, I've tried everything, save me."
"The sound from our new little Dot is great for playing soft music, but it seems to quit for no reason I can discern.  I can ask Alexa to ""play sleep music,"" and it always makes the same suggestion (Here's a playlist you might like, ""Dream Time,"" on Amazon Music). Dream Time is great, but it's getting kind of old … but that's a topic for another post.    For some reason, if I wake up after a couple of hours or in the middle of the night, there's no music playing. I can understand that the playlist might have ended, but even if I select the playlist on my phone and send it to the Dot, also clicking the *Shuffle* button (isn't that the button with two arrow that criss-cross?), it seems to stop after a while.  Shouldn't the shuffle option make the music continuous?  Or does it play each track once and then stop?    Side-question: The button in Amazon Music that's just an arrow going in a circle—I'm assuming that just repeats the current track over and over?    I've had better luck tuning in radio stations, or sometimes online stations (such as those available through Amazon Music), but sometimes even the Amazon Music stations will stop. In fact, the only time I can remember waking up in the morning with music still playing was when I tuned in a local classical music station.    Is there some voice command I should be giving Alexa? Like, ""Alexa, repeat this playlist until 6 AM?"" or something like that?    Any and all advice is appreciated.  Thanks!"
I have smart switches and they are all hooked up to alexa and work good. I have an echo button that I would like to press to turn on the light and push a second time to turn off the light. How should I set up the routine to make this work?

"I have an echo show. I have a TV connected to some good speakers; I use a Chromecast to watch TV and to listen to music. I do this by opening the app on my phone and casting to the TV.  What do I need to do to be able to say 'Alexa play Nickelback to my TV speakers' ?  Ok, maybe not Nickelback, but you get the idea.  Do I need to replace my Chromecast with a Fire Stick? If I do that, can I still use the Fire Stick as a Chromecast target?"
"Just spent an hour and a half with the useless amazon online customer service trying to fix my amazon, and they practically left me to fix the problem on my own after firstly giving me all the obvious possible fixes, and finally throwing at me paragraphs of more technical fixes, of which none work.   I just received my first echo dot today and I can't connect it to my wifi. When I turn it on at first, I go through with it on the app, and the echo dot claims to have updated and connected. But then when I call ""Alexa"", it flashes red three times and says ""sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now, please try again a little later"". I try reconnecting through the app, but I get nowhere as once I have slected the network again, it tells me to connect my phone to the echo dot through it's AmazonXXX wifi network (which I'm already connected to), and it doesn't move forward from there unless I reset the echo again, and repeat of the problem.   I have tried resetting, restarting and relocating the echo device. I have tried putting it in the room where the router is. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. No matter how many times I try, I get nowhere.  Does anyone know what can I do to make it work please?  Many thanks"

" My grandson has some medical challenges that require his input and output to be captured and monitored thru out the day. Today, all of this is captured via paper.

"This started around early December. Ask the time and Alexa responds with the time, then follows up with ""I hope you are having a lovely evening"" (or similar).  Apparently this isn't something everyone is getting as colleagues of mine don't experience it. As great as Alexa is I'm fully aware she couldn't care less how my evening is going so seems a bit daft to say she's hoping it's going swell :)  It's very annoying and I can't see how it was enabled.  Any idea how to remove it?  *(I posted this in another subreddit, but should have crossposted it here so just reposting)"
"Hi, I've run into this unique problem and can't find anything about it online so I hope some of you can help me.  I've lately gotten and installed a hwq90r soundsystem. I've got it connected to the smart things app where it is recognized as a soundbar. So far, so good. I've installed the SmartThings skill on Alexa.   Now when I try to connect Alexa with my soundsystem it does find the device but it turns up as a light switch. Trying to change the type of the device doesn't work since I can only change it to a light.  I've no clue how this could go wrong since the SmartThings app does recognize the soundbar as a soundbar."

"Anyone else think the echo show 8 {maybe same with 5} is pointed way too high when sitting on a table. I have ours sitting on an end table between my wife and my chairs. If we want to video call with someone the camera is pointed at the ceiling. Seems this device should have an adjustable stand of some sort, afterall this is basically a computer monitor and monitors have had an adjustable base for over 20 years. Has anyone rigged up a way to adjust angle?"
"In general, can an echo device be configured so that you can only control certain devices from it?  Perfect scenario: We would like the kid to be able to control her lights and color change her bulb, drop in, etc. but NOT be able to turn off the kitchen, TV, our room, scenes like “all lights” etc.  Is that possible?"
"I have an Echo in every room (either a Dot, Flex or Show), and I'd like to be able to ask Alexa to play music from any room and have it play over a single Echo Input no matter where the request was made. (The Echo Input is wired into an amp, which is wired into a ceiling speaker in every room.)  Does anyone know if it's possible to set the preferred speaker for a device to be an Echo in another room? It seems the preferred speaker can only be either a device in the same room group (which this isn't) or a speaker group (which requires more than one device in the group)."

"Sorry if this has been asked before. Alexa refuses to play an entire soundtrack. She plays the first song and then stops. If I ask her about it, she says, “hmm... I don’t know about that”. How do I get her to play the entire soundtrack like she used to, even if I have to pay for it?!"
"Whenever my little sisters and their friends sing along (out of sync, I can barely tell what they’re saying) to the song “happier” by marshmallow Alexa stops playing it about 10-30 seconds in. I thought maybe one of the lyrics was mistaken as the wake word, but I had them do it again to test and sure enough the music stopped but the blue light never came on, and in my Alexa history it doesn’t show anything. We tried this 4 times and it happened every time. When they listen to the song without singing along there are no issues. Any idea why this could be happening?"
"I've been frantically Googling this for the past hour (OK, five minutes) and I'm surprised no one seems to be bothered by it.  I watch a lot of movies and TV, and one of my favourite things to do is ask Alexa how old various famous people are. It's extremely rare she doesn't know the answer, but unfortunately she's programmed not just to tell me the person's age (which is all I want to know), but then to give their full date of birth (which takes twice as long to say as a simple age).     I didn't mind this at first, but it's really started to annoy me (perhaps because I ask this question a lot). After she's told me the celebrity's age, I have to tell her to shut up.     Would it be so hard to programme Alexa to differentiate between asking someone's age vs asking someone's birthday/date?     When you ask someone in real life how old they are (or someone else is), they'll give you the answer in years, nothing else. They won't give you their full date of birth. Shouldn't Alexa mimic what a real person would do? It's very annoying."
"Hi there everyone, I am trying to set up a voice assistant for my grandpa who lives in a nursing home so he can make calls and ask about basic things as he can’t function a phone easily.  We have tried to set up a google home however the home’s WiFi settings have AP isolation enabled and they have refused to change it. We tried connecting a new modem and travel router to the Coax in his room ( just to try as much as possible)  and unfortunately the nursing home won’t give us a spectrum account number to log into so all we have is the WiFi password.  I was just wondering if Alexa or another voice assistant works with AP isolation enabled unlike the google homes and therefore would allow my grandpa to actually make calls."
Curious if anyone might have an idea.  I logged into my Alexa app on my iPhone today to manually change the music station.  When I hit play it gave me an option to play from a fire stick TV.  The problem is we don’t have a fire stick and I’ve never seen this device in my app before.  I tried making an announcement to the devices in the house but didn’t hear anything and when I selected that device it said unable to play.  Any suggestions?

"Is there a way to make an echo show ""show camera blah"" at a given time and set the volume to #?"
Is there a way to set a routine so Alexa will Guard during an Arm Stay or home routine? I want it to listen whenever the alarm is on but not constantly. Is there a way to do that?
"So, I live in an apartment with a friend and we have our own echos. Same wifi, different linked Amazon accounts.   I tried something on a whim, don't know why but I asked roomies echo to shut off the lights in my room and it did. I tried it the other way, mine can control the switches in his.  How did it do that when we didn't set it up that way?"
"I'm following a tutorial for adding Home Assistant integration to Alexa.  When creating a Lamda function, the tutorial calls for adding a ""Alexa Smart Home"" trigger.  But when I add a trigger, the only ""Alexa..."" trigger available is ""Alexa Skills Kit"".  Are they equivalent?  Did Amazon change the wording for the same thing?"
"Hi there. I have several of my lights in my house set up with Alexa via the Smart Life app. I have no problem controlling them with Alexa.   At one point in the past I must have had my mother's Amazon account on my phone because her Alexa account keeps showing my lights as well. We don't live in the same house, or even close to each other.  I went into her alexa settings on her PC and clicked remove for all my devices but when you press discover they just pop right back up again.   How do I make sure my devices stop showing and being controllable on her account?"
"Is it possible to let my bedroom lights slowly getting brighter when the alarm rings? I got it that the lights turn on, but directly and only on the last setting."
Thought from a couple of days ago. I would like for the light ring on my echo dot to act as a night light at night. Is it possible
"So I used to have a routine set up that was “Alexa it’s TV time” and the lights would change to my optimal tv viewing lighting.   Not too long ago though it stopped working, and instead of changing the lights Alexa started saying “No, televisions are not clock times.”  What does this mean?!? Is this a reference to something?? She says it every time now and I had to change the voice command in order to get the routine to work again, but it is just such a weird response!  If anyone has any idea what she is talking about please help me solve this mystery! It looks like TV Time is something in the UK maybe but when I Google this exact phrase I can’t see to find a direct quote that this would be referencing anywhere!"
"There was some sort of stuffup when setting up my new LIFX bulb in my bedroom.  When it got to the part about groups, there was some sort of error, but setup continued and seemed fine, all routines worked with the light too.  But ask to turn the bedroom lightbon, dim it, change colour etc and I get the title of this post."
"So this is very weird, but I have an Echo Dot set up along with three smart lights in the living room. The lights are all in the group “Living Room”. When I ask Alexa to “turn on the lights in the living room”, she seems to get really confused and thinks there are multiple devices with name “lights living rooms” (she says it like that, plural lights and plural living rooms). I do not have any other devices with any name remotely close to “living room”, and I do not have any other groups similarly named.   But here’s where things get more strange...if I ask Alexa to “turn on the lights in the living room” in a high pitched voice, it works fine. I only thought to try this because it works fine when my wife asks, but Alexa just can’t seem to understand me. Here are two videos showing the behavior:  Regular voice: https://streamable.com/eaj6k Weird sounding high pitched voice: https://streamable.com/wvdr4  Why is Alexa saying “a few things share the name lights living rooms”? That’s such an odd way of saying that, and why does it only happen when I use a normal voice pitch?"
"Sorry this is so immature lol but my friend wants to prank their mom by having Alexa fart throughout the day. I know if you ask Alexa to fart she will, but can you set a timer for her to fart? When I ask Alexa to fart at a certain time she just tells me about flatulence lol. It's a brand new device in my friend's house so we're still trying to figure it out. Thanks to anyone who can help :)"

"Hey just bought the amazon dot, for some reason it wont play ny specific playlists? when I say “Play my Jamming playlist” it autmatically pulls a playlist made by Spotify with thr closest name... Any help?"
"I see that echo buttons are no longer available from Amazon, is their a reason these have been withdrawn?  Is there an alternative I can link so that when pressed, it toggles a routine, such as lights on and music playing, then when pressed again toggles the routine off? Hope that makes sense :)"
Anyone found this?   It sometimes sounds like the speakers have blown if I have music playing too long.   It doesn’t load many things. I’ve enabled skills and it won’t recognise it. It sometimes even listens and does nothing.   I’ve tried playing Song Quiz. Can’t get passed the first step of how many players there are as if I say 2 it either shuts down or tells me the meaning of the number 2.   Anyone having issues?
"Is anyone using an echo dot in their garage? Any concerns with hi and low temps? I’m in the north Texas area and workout in my garage. Would like to use the echo dot for music, audio books and timer."

Does anybody know the exact size of the power jack in the latest echo dot with certainty or can anyone point me in the direction of some official specs which could help me out? Thanks.

"Hi ,  I have never used alexa, but got an echo and a sony x900e tv for my elderly mother.  Is there a way to set the sleep timer on the sony x900e tv either through echo dot or the tv using alexa ?  Thanks"
"Just a mild rant, I try to defend Alexa over Siri in most regards, but I have to say it let me down a bit.  I was trying to figure out what area code was 925 so I asked Alexa and she said ""Sorry, I don't know that one"" which was very disappointed.  Siri knew, which made it even worse.  &amp;#x200B;  Step it up Amazon! That's the simplest DB to link to the search!"
"My Dot is doing something strange. For the past three days at 5:24 she pipes up, repeating ""Hands down, this is the best of my life."" over and over until told to stop. It is a male voice, possibly Olaf from Frozen/Frozen II(?)   WTH is going on and/or how can I find out what is going on?"
"Is there any way of getting it to ignore a user that it recognises? My partner's daughter finds it hilarious to persistently ask for annoying songs and short of muting Alexa (or my partner actually parenting his daughter - another story), is there anything we can do to block her requests?"
"I want to be able to play movies for my dog while I'm at work.  I can use my app to play music in my living room no matter where I am (just played him the Jingle Cats Medley), but what about controlling Netflix etc?  From Google I thought I would be able to use the app to give voice commands to the echo dot in my living room, but the app keeps telling me I don't have video skills enabled.  Is it possible to use my app to play Cats vs Dogs (or whatever) on my tv, and if so, could someone walk me through how? Thank you!"
UK here - Anyone else getting this now ? Mostly with my Wemo plugs....
"I now have 5 Alexa's in our house, the most recent being an old stock Echo 2nd gen that I purchased new in November.    I wanted one of the bigger Echo's that I'd hoped would have better sound for our living room.  In hindsight it ended up being little better than the current-gen Echo Dot that I had there previously, but that's another story, and I got it on a points bonus thing with a local retailer so it didn't cost me a lot in the end.  Regardless, the thing is turning out to be a giant piece of junk - it's offline or fails to work more than it's online.   Sometimes when I call for it the blue light activates but then it just seems to do...nothing.   The light moves around when I keep talking to it (suggestive of the fact it's still listening actively as I move around the room) but it just doesn't DO anything - eventually the light just goes out.    Sometimes randomly I get responses to the inquiry from my other Dots elsewhere in the house.  Sometimes nothing at all.   Often I get the red ring with the ""I'm having trouble"" response.  I thought some of these issues were a result of the typical Christmas onslaught of new Alexa devices, but it continues...even when my other Alexa devices are working fine again now.  I've tried resetting to factory defaults and setting it up again.  I've tried switching from my 2.4ghz network to my 5.0ghz network, and back again.  I've tried disassociating it from my account and setting it up again.  I've removed it from all groupings that it was in.  I've ensured it has the latest firmware.  I've rebooted it countless times.  It's still hopeless.  I've begun the process of trying to contact Amazon now to troubleshoot and hopefully get a warranty replacement on this POS, but I'm wondering what the experience of others has been?     As much as I absolutely love my Alexas, this one is a turd.   In hindsight I should have returned it to the place I bought it from, but the window was 30 days (now past us) and given as how I bought it with a points promotion tied in with other products at the same time I could only imagine the return would be difficult at best, or impossible at worst.    I'm now hoping Amazon will at least stand behind it."
"I have an echo plus and 2 echo dots, is it possible for me to have sound go to my echo plus via the aux connection and then play through all devices?  I use them all in the same room as speakers for music, but could I I'd like to have other devices coming through them"
"I think it would be nice if Alexa could tell me if it were raining, without asking."
"Hello! Had a weird thing happen to my Alexa tonight and I cant find anything on Google.  To start, I havent updated the Wi-Fi on my Alexa Dot after switching routers. I don't have any alarms set whatsoever. Out of nowhere, around 5:30am, Alexa started pulsing blue and playing the alarm sound. She wouldn't respond to my voice to stop, cancel the alarm, wouldn't even acknowledge I was talking to her.  I checked the app. No messages (I couldn't get any anyway because no internet), no alarms set, no notification whatsoever as to what could be causing her to freak out. I wound up having to unplug her. Any ideas?"
"I have a new Echo Dot with Clock that replaced an older Dot in my bedroom. It's been working fine from Christmas until yesterday when it started prompting for me to ""Unlock Your Device"" before turning my bedside light off/on. I have Echos in two other rooms (a gen1 Echo and a gen2 Dot) with lights and they don't make any prompt - they continue to turn the lights off/on without any further interaction.  The lights are connected through SmartThings - they are Kasa switches but they're identified as lights in the Alexa app.  Any suggestions how to turn this off? If I have to unlock my phone every time I was to turn the light off/on I might as well do it manually."
"I've had an Alexa for around 8 months, I work from home and it's been great for playing different music stations in my office. My husband has a Prime account, I don't so I added my husband's account so we have a Household account with both profiles.   I bought another Alexa for the bedroom at Christmas and every time I ask to play from Tunein radio it plays upstairs and my office Alexa is quiet, I've unplugged the upstairs Alexa and my office Alexa is sullen and silent.  Can someone please post a resource for making them speak to each other? Like how can I nominate the office Alexa to play Tunein radio when she used to do?  TL;DR Since I bought a 2nd Alexa my office Alexa is upset there's another device in the house and refuses to play"
"Okay so I keep having this issue where my lights (smart life) keep saying ""device is unresponsive"" and alexa will say ""I couldnt find a device or group named x in x's profile"" despite the fact the devices are clearly paired and in the group she claims doesnt exist. I tried unpairing and repairing the lights and also unsyncing and resyncing app as well as disabling then reenabling the skill for smart life. Ive also tried turning my lights on from the app and a second alexa and same response both times, the lights still turn on and off and even wkek in the smart light app just not alexa. Can anybody help?"
I already set Apple Music as a skill but every time I say play something on Apple Music alexa responds by saying it needs and update but there is no update
"I'm getting fed up with Amazon Music Unlimited.  The voice commands seem to be getting worse and worse as the years go by.  It now plays more covers, live versions, etc., and I'm sick of it.      Also, much of my music collection isn't available on Amazon Music Unlimited (or Spotify).  Some of the favourites, I've bought through Amazon, but many are not available new through Amazon, as they're out of print.    Is there any way to use my Echo to play music that's not on Amazon Music Unlimited (e.g., upload ripped CDs, or put them onto a storage device)?  I'm not a big audiophile, so what do people with big collections do?    Thanks in advance!"
"Just wondering if anyone has played puzzle of the day on Alexa yet? I got my first device this Christmas (echo show 8!) and have been playing, just made in the top 50 for the first time. It's like a daily competitive crossword type game.  Just wondering if anyone else here plays and where you generally place"
I thought I read somewhere a while back that Guard was adding a feature to listen and notify you if it hears voice(speaking) while your away. Anyone know what happened with this? Did they cancel it?
"I want certain voice commands to be executed a future point in time. As if I said it myself, but happening in the future. Like timers and alerts, but then submitting what I had said earlier when I set this ""pre-scheduling"".  What I have in mind: I want a WeMo plug to switched about half an hour after I fell asleep. And I can schedule the WeMo plugs with the app, but I don't know the time, because I fall asleep at different times. So when I go to bed I want to set it up so that half an hour later the WeMo switches. And the only way I can think of is to submit some Alexa voice command with a time delay. Unfortunately the WeMo app doesn't have something like ""turn on/off in 30 minutes""."
The alarm on our echo dot has stopped working.  I’ve deleted it and reset it several times.  Any ideas?
"Hello all,  I gifted my parents an echo show a while ago and it's signed in to my amazon account (since they don't use amazon).   Does it by default display shipped and delivered notifications and the items ordered?  Thanks in advance!"
"Hi folks, I'm not sure of this is ""normal"" or not.  I flashed all my Tuya devices to Tasmota.  With MQTT they are all in Home Assistant.  I enabled Hue Bridge for each device.  My problem is that I have duplicate devices in Alexa... one for each devices as a *Royal Philips Electronics smart device* AND a *Hue Light*.  I'm not sure where the Hue Light is coming from.  This is showing in the web version only.  The Alexa app on my phone or tablet doesn't have duplicates.  I hope this is a good place to ask."
Has anyone ran into this? Just started with one of my dots today.  It will turn my group labeled “bar” on but when I ask to turn it off  it says it can’t find the group in my profile.   All other Dots and our Show will turn the bar group off.
I just find it more natural to say thank you than cancel.

"I'm starting to think Alexa has some kind of Quixotical fetish for the bath -  Everytime I ask her to play 'Classical Music' she says 'Playing Relaxing Classics for the Bath'  What the fuubar is wrong with my Alexa and Echo Dots - Also this quiet music is periodically interrupted by loud adverts at 10x the volume of the music that is playing, a quiet Chopin Nocturne for instance will get me nice and relaxed and then a loud advert will blare out 10X louder.  And what is this obsession with the 'Bath', It's redicicolous, everytime that I ask for 'Classical Music' to be played - Alexa responds 'Playing classical music for a relaxing bath' or something like that.  I'm not having a bath, I am trying to relax in my room, what does the bath have to do with it!   ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHGHG!"
"Hello all!  I'm wondering how to setup Alexa to multiple devices in my home. We use Amazon fire devices. 1st gen cube on our main tv, 4k fire dongle thing in our bedroom tv and first gen stick in a guest room. We want to add extra devices, such as Legrand smart light switches, smart wall outlets (so i don't have to run wire for a dedicated switch, for Christmas lights), outdoor speakers in the back patio soffit, an alexa enabled surround sound receiver when i finish our downstairs living room, and speakers only (no mics) in my kids rooms for white noise.   That said, how does it all connect? I thought i read that there is no hub needed? So it doesn't all run through my Cube? I feel like i'm very computer literate, but i'm totally lost/overwhelmed with this setup.... LOL"
Drop in works fine on all other devices- but won’t work from the kids’ shows/dot. It says that room is unavailable. Is this due to the kids settings? Any way to fix this?
"So I recently switched music streaming services.  I switched from Tidal to Amazon Music thanks in part to the 99 Cent 4 months deal, I just couldn't pass that up. Unfortunately, Amazon Music didn't accept my playlists from Tidal so I lost those, however that's not what my post is about today.  I noticed that when I requested songs through Alexa from Amazon Music Alexa would pronounce the Song Titles vastly different than when I requested them from Tidal. For instance, Alexa would pronounce ""Water"" with Amazon Music more human like, than how she did through Tidal.  There are a few more examples but the bottom line is that it seems as if Amazon set Alexa to pronounce song titles more correctly and more human through their streaming service rather than supported services.   Is it a service side pronounciation engine from Amazon? Or does Amazon purposefully code Alexa to pronounce song names from alternative services less correctly?  Just something I wanted to shed some light on."
"I am new to Alexa and have recently purchased a Sonos beam. I am having terrible trouble trying to set my default music source to Apple Music. I have done this over and over in the app, linking my Apple Music and then setting it as default provider. Whenever I ask Alexa on my beam to play something it try’s to find it on amazon music! I am getting so frustrated with this does anyone know why it won’t play through Apple Music as it should do?"
"If you are away from your home, can you use your Versa 2 to trigger any of your routines as long as you have your phone with you? Also, to use Alexa, can you close out the Alexa app on your Android phone, and have the screen locked and display off?"
Currently trying to decide between a Google Home and Amazon Echo and I've heard that the GH allows hands free phone calls to UK mobiles and landlines. I know the Echo can phone other Alexa devices but is there any way to phone mobile numbers? Thanks :)
"Hi Everyone   I have just set up a brand new Alexa i got as a christmas present to my Spotify account on my phone but the voice command doesn't seem to work.   I have paired my phone via bluetooth to Alexa. They are both on the same Network.   I have linked my premium Spotify to Alexa on the link new service section. I have selected it as my default music library.   When i play a song on spotify using my phone it comes out on the Alexa speaker fine.   However if I ask her to change the song and say ""play Wonderwall by Oasis"" Alexa says ""Wonderwall by Oasis from Spotify""  but nothing happens and the same song continues.   Am i missing something? Do i need to something else to use voice command using spotify?   Thanks so much for reading.   James"
"Quick summary:  Wife’s amazon account has Prime and Amazon Music Unlimited Family plan  My Amazon account is linked via Household to hers   When I log in to the Alexa app using her account, i am prompted to select a profile(?) e.g. is it me, her etc. I see all of our devices regardless of the profile I select.   When I log into the Alexa app using my account, the experience appears the same.   First question — should I be logging into the Alexa app on my phone using my amazon account, or using my wife’s account and then selecting my name when prompted for the profile?  Second question — Ideally I’d like the Alexa devices able to distinguish between me, my wife and kids for purposes of the music playlists.  What’s the best way, or is it even possible to do this easily without the need to tell Alexa to switch accounts?  Can I set up voice profiles for the five of us and then would Alexa know when I’m asking it to play a song or give a daily briefing vs when one of my kids is asking to play a song?  As it stands now, I log into Amazon Music using my wife’s amazon account, and I see the history of everything that everyone has been playing, all seemingly from the same account/profile.   Thanks. This seems way more confusing than it should be..."
"You guys, I'm about to throw Alexa in the dumpster. I haven't slept all night and was about to shut my eyes when I hear a woman laugh not 10 feet from me.   My eyes shot wide open and I felt chills go down my spine and my stomach lurched. It took me less than 30 seconds to breathe and grab my gun in my nightstand.   I walked all around the house thinking about what demon or hag walked up into my house at 5 am. I sat on the couch and took a lot of deep breaths because I know I heard it.  Then I saw Alexa and thought... it was you... wasn't it. I asked her if she laughed and she went on about something completely random.  She scared the crap out of me but I'm proud of myself for getting the courage to act so quickly. Being single and living alone with my cat and hearing this brat laugh was not the best for my soul today.  Now I'm not going back to sleep....   Side note... I asked Alexa if she could laugh and she said something along the lines of yes and went TeeeeHeeee.  Then I go on youtube and look up Alexa laughing and it's close to what I heard tonight."

Hey guys i'm relatively new to the peloton and totally love it (About a month in). I'm also a bit of a smart home nerd so found a way to integrate amazon alexa with my peloton. I can now schedule live classes with certain instructors through voice or get progress on my recent workouts.   Let me know your feedback and whether this is something you would use and other possible features. I'm always about trying to make the experience better. The skill is not on the store yet as i'm trying to work with Peloton to get some authentication modules working. Later on I want to incorporate a recommendation engine that will give people insight on the classes they should take along with some good old fashion encouragement.

"Not too long ago I was asking Alexa Easter egg questions but when I asked ""alexa open the pod bay doors"" and something wierd asf happened. Alexa voice went deeper and started talking about the higher ups controlling us through media and memes, it asked ""are you a 1? Or a zero?"" I was scared shitless so I turned it off, but then it just turned on again and continued. This is some creepy pasta level shit and I can't figure out what caused it. My friend was with me so I wasn't just tripping, I can't find any accounts of this happening anywhere."

"My current setup is an echo dot in the same room as my onkyo receiver(namedliving room atm). The receiver is configured as alexas main output for media,so if I say ""Alexa play Metallica"" it plays it onthe receiver and if I say louder while music plays it turns it up.   Now, whenwatching TV I can stillcontrol the loudnessof the receiver, but only if I say ""Alexa louder on Livingroom""  ""Alexa louder"" just triggers the echo dot itself.  Is there any way to have volume commands always refer to a certain device and not the dot itself?"

I had the old echo dot that was flat and tound for the past year or so and I finally unplugged it and set up my newer gen one but for some reason when I tell her to “set a alarm for 9am on tuesdays and thursdays” it repeatedly keeps asking me “what day?”. What am I doing wrong? The old one worked fine that way.
"I bought two Feit smart multicolor bulbs - I can strobe the lights through the Feit app, but was wondering if I could do something similar with Alexa.  So questions are -   Is there a way to strobe Feit bulbs through Alexa?  Is there a way to loop routines or scenes through Alexa?"
"So my wife and I both have the Alexa app on our iPhones and are logged in with each of our Amazon account and both see the one Echo we have in our device list.  In my Alexa app it says the Echo is registered to my wife’s account. Which is fine.   Now, we bought two echo dots for our kids and I’ve created them an Amazon account to setup their echo under their own accounts on their iPhones.   But I can’t seem to be able to see their echo in my device list in my Alexa app.   From my reading so far it seems normal that I can’t see the echo dots because they are registered to my kids account, but how come I can see my wife’s account?  So which is which ? Should I be able to see all the echos in my house with my one account or is it a bug that I can see my wife’s Echo on my phone ?   Man this is hard to explain and not confuse everyone after two lines, thanks for bearing with me 😕  Oh and I’m in Canada, so the Amazon Household does not work here."
"Hi all,  I have the Ring security system and Alexa setup as a routine to automatically arm my ring security system at 10pm daily. Is there a way I can create a routine to disarm the alarm at 5 am?

"Bought my dad a ring doorbell for Christmas, he isn’t very tech savvy so I helped him set it up. Since my family uses one amazon account, I set it up with my log in info. He is very happy as it came with an echo show as well but now every time some one walks near his front door I get a notification on my Alexa at work, on my alexas at my apartment and my brother get notifications at his home. I’ve updated the address on all of the devices and tried setting up routines but I can’t seem to get the ring doorbell notification only at my dads house. Does anyone have any idea how I can stop getting ring doorbell notifications on my alexas?"
"So I am asking this as an owner of an Alexa the last three years, but how do people feel about how the platform is progressing in user friendly ways.  I bring this up because I feel like things have stagnated for the last year or so.  There hasn't been much that's meaningful in terms of apps that we would use and there doesn't appear to much advancement in the system's ability to understand instructions (if anything I would swear that things have actually gotten worse).  It's gotten to point where the wife and I have seriously considered doing a trial of the Nest Hub and see how it interacts with our daily lives.  I have a suspicion that because we both have Android Phones that there would be a considerable improvement.  Anyway, I just wanted to see where everyone else was at in terms of where the Ecosystem is at right now vs where they expected it to be when they first bought into the Alexa system."
I'd like to turn my computer on automatically when I get home so I set wolskill but it won't show up under skills when I set up a routine

When someone at home calls me from one of our Alexa devices the caller ID displayed is my friends name and number. She lives in a different city and doesn't have access to my Alexa app or info. It's annoying because I think it's her calling and it isnt and something isn't right. I've tried looking through my app for any connection but I can't find anything. Can anyone help or has anyone had anything similar?
"I'm using ambient sounds when sleeping. It normally last 1 hour unless you loop it which I do every day.  But last night, it stopped after 30 minutes and did so every time I asked it to play. I tried unplugging/plugging the Echo and changed to different skills but I still have that issue.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyone here noticed that as well?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks"
"Hello, I have bought one personal eco for my room, and I want to use my personal Spotify account on only that device, avoiding the rest of my family bother my music history. Is that possible?"
"I have six Echo Inputs. When I am playing music from just one Input I am able to change the volume of the Input from the Alexa app. But if I am playing music from an Echo Input that is part of a speaker group, I cannot change the volume of any Echo Inputs that are in the group from the app. When I try to change the volume I receive an error that says ""Volume Change Unavailable. To change volume, you must be playig audio. If audio is playing, check your network connection, then try again.""  &amp;#x200B;  The same thing is happening with all six Echo Input devices that I own and they are not all in the same group.  &amp;#x200B;  Can anyone who has an Input try this and see if you have the same problem? I think it is a bug and it is quite frustrating."
"We have several Echo devices in our house and they are all controlled via my Alexa app on my phone. My daughter has her own Echo dot in her room and her friend just had one for Christmas which is controlled via her parents Alexa app. My question is, is there a way my daughters friend can drop in on just my daughters device? They have been trying but it seems to randomly pick a device to drop in on at our end? Thanks in advance!"
Recently I installed a Alexa enabled Ecobee. Was wondering if I could use it as a baby monitor to listen in from my Echo in the kitchen.  How could I do that?
"I just picked up a fire tv cube and a soundbar. In my first few days, I could pause and play videos at ease by just saying pause or play.   However, after setting up some routines, the play command automatically turns on spotify and plays music onto my whole house multiroom music group.  Whatever was playing on spotify before will continue but instead now routed through the multiroom music group.  ""Pause"" still works fine, but when I say ""Play"" it insta opens multiroom spotify, no matter if I'm mid episode, on youtube or at the home screen. Can someone please help suggest what I may have done to add this inconvenience?"
"I have been setting up my house and the last thing my wife told me was to set up a routine where we can say ""Alexa Iam Home"" and we have the airconditioner, Family Lights, MainBed Room lights and TV turned on, while the routine works flawlessly if i name it any other way it just wont work if i set up a routine where i say Alexa, ""Iam Home"".   She just say random phrases like ""Hello, I am Glad u are back"" or maybe a ""Well Hello, I am very happy u are here"" or even a ""welcome home, is nice to have u here"" or a ""welcome home, i hope u are having a good day""  But none of those responses trigger my routine and weird part is that i have read soooo many places when people set up those routines for when they leave or just get back home.  And we are a bilingual family and we cant even say it in spanish because is the same answer but no routines are executed.  Can someone please let me know if iam doing something wrong, or theres a work around? I really appreciate all the help i can get.  BTW: devices are two  ""echo dot 3rd gen"""
"I think I know the answer to this, but I’m hoping I’m wrong.  I have First Alert Onelink Safe &amp; Sound smart smoke/co2 detectors in 6 locations in my home. All of these locations also have Luton Caseta controlled lighting and are defined as rooms.  I can say ‘Alexa turn on the kitchen lights’ but I’d prefer to say ‘Alexa turn on the lights’ because I’m talking to the smart speaker in the kitchen.  I know this can be done with echo and echo dots... but it doesn’t appear that this works with 3rd party smart speakers that have Alexa onboard like the Safe &amp; Sound or a Sonos One.  This seems like an arbitrary limitation with no real technical rationale.  Anyone have any insight?"
Now we can only add one
Hello i was wondering if there was any way to sync reminders across echo devices?  I have an echo dot in the bedroom but whenever i set reminders they dont sync across to my echo show device downstairs.  I would of assumed that it would of done it automatically but i cannot seem to find any way of sorting it out.   Many thanks in advance for any help or advice
Is there any way to actually look at your music library on the echo show? or does it really only give you the option to look at recently played?
"I picked up 2 Ecovac Deebots (s79W) recently, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. And i'm trying to find a way to control both of them with Alexa.  The skill appears to only be able to allow me to manage one (it sees both when i set up the skill, but i can only choose one to manage).  I haven't seen anything helpful on this issue anywhere.  Has anyone gotten this to work successfully?"
"I tried doing a search and didn’t quite find what I’m looking for.   When Alexa gives me notifications (like upcoming calendar events) she repeats it twice in a row. Sometimes she’ll stop on the middle the first time and then start over. Other times she’ll get all the way through, take a quick pause, and then repeat it. The same thing happens with a skill I have set up with a daily challenge reminder.   Is there a setting somewhere I’m missing or is this some sort of a glitch?"
"I have 2 cats that stay at home during the day alone and i'd like to be able to play some ambient nature sounds, music etc, so they are not sitting in silence all day.   I don't want to leave my tv on, and I'd like to be able to control it while i'm away from the Alexa app.  is this possible?  I've tried a few things and can't seem to find this function."
"Hey everyone,  I've got 3 Echo Dots (3rd Gen), arranged into 3 different rooms.  2 of the rooms are the kid's bedrooms and they each have a Kasa TP-Link Dimmer switch.  They work great when used with the name of the light. eg. ""Alexa, turn off kid1's light"".  They also work great within the Alexa app... turn on/off/dim just fine.  However, I've read that I should be able to just say ""Alexa, turn off the lights"" when I'm in kid1's room, talking to kid1's Echo Dot.  When I try this, Alexa says ""kasa smart wifi switch doesn't support that"".  Any ideas why this isn't working?"
"Hello i have 4 Philips Hue bulbs, two work perfectly connected via my phone on the app and also work fine with my Echo devices for voice commands.   Two bulbs however will not seem to be discovered by my echo devices at all, they are connected via the Hue app and can be controlled via my phone. But my Echo devices ( Show 5 and Echo dot) will not discover them at all.   I believe i have tried everything with nothing seeming to work at the moment.   Many thanks in advance for any replies, help or advice regarding this.   Take care."
" I am having an issue with my Echo Dot where I have set it up (supposedly) correctly and connected my spotify account to it, which works fine.  My current issue with it is that whenever I say something like ""Alexa, play my xyz playlist"", it just continues playing the current song.  If I go into the Alexa app then into the ""Play"" tab, it shows the playlists I have requested, and if I click it and then press play on my Echo Dot, it does the same thing (continues with whatever is currently playing).  I have disconnected my Echo Dot and reconnected it, however this did not help.  Has anyone else had this issue before? How did you resolve it?"
"I have several Echo devices, is it possible to link specific devices (my living room tv for example) to a specific Echo (my main Echo for example).   My issue is this: The main Echo in our house is on a counter between the kitchen and living room. 9/10 times we can say “turn the tv up” and the volume goes up. Every once in a while, it tries to turn on the Xbox upstairs, or says I have several things named tv (which I do, I have two smart TVs and several fire sticks throughout the house).   Without creating a routine specific to this device, is it possible to just link a device to a specific Echo? Or do I need to create routines for those specific Echos?"
"Hello -  I've tried a number of Google searches on this but no solution yet. I have my iPhone paired with Alexa. But now, instead of notifying me on my phone when I receive a message, it does it on Alexa. How do I stop this?"
"Is there any way to make Alexa play your “liked” songs, but only from a particular genre or type? I tried, for example, saying, “Play new age music I like” and didn’t get the desired result."
"We use Alexa as a kitchen timer very frequently. Our dog doesn't like the sound of our oven door opening, and seems to have associated the sound of an Alexa timer going off with the oven door about to open. So when an Alexa timer goes off, he'll scurry away.  The strangest thing is, he can now predict when the timer is about to go off. We'll be sitting around with nothing going on, and he'll suddenly get up and run off down the hall. Within a few seconds, an Alexa timer will go off. It's like he knows it's coming.  Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know if there is a precursor noise for an Alexa timer that is outside the human hearing range? We used a phone app that is a sound spectrum analyzer, but it only covered up to 20 kHz and we saw nothing."
"Hi guys,  Had my Echo Spot on my PC Desk and decided to swap with the Show 5 and move Spot to bedside.  Now here's the thing, Alexa does not readily respond on the the Show 5, multiple times I'll have to repeat the wake word more than once. This never happened with the Spot.  Any advice?"
"Did anyone manage to connect Alexa to a webOS 4.7 TV from LG?   Despite the articles I found online, I did not manage to control the TV via my Echo.   Here is what I did:  - created an LG account - connected the Alexa app on the TV with my Amazon account - in the Alexa app on the TV I could find the echo and link to it - on the Echo I enabled both LG ThinQ skills  - from the Alexa app I can't find the TV when discovering devices but can see the TV in my group of devices already (maybe because I linked the TV via the Alexa app from the TV)  I read online that there is a setting on the TV to allow being discovered by setting it to ""Alexa"" but can't find it on my version of the TV.   Any hints are highly appreciated!"
"Hey there,  I already have 2 Echo Dot 3rd generation which I like a lot. I use them among other things as playback devices on my computers when I watch videos on Youtube or Netflix without any issues.  The thing is, I just bought an Echo Show 8 and when I use it in the same conditions, there is an audio delay to the point where I just can't watch the video because it is really out of sync.  Anyone had the same issue and if so, is there any way I could adjust the latency in Windows 10 for that specific device?  Cheers"
"A regular USB Killer destroys a computer by sending pulses of electronic through a USB-A port. Does anyone know if I get some kind to USB-A to Micro USB adapter if it’d fry an Echo Dot?  I kinda want to try this, but I’d have to buy a USB Killer first."
My echo dot just recently started having Alexa say where she is playing from. I have set brief mode on and off and tried pretty much everything I can think of but she always says it if I just started my iPad.  I have had my echo for over a year without this issue but when she says this it throws off the Bluetooth voice sync otherwise I wouldn’t worry about it.   Any help is much appreciated.
My 9 year old was gifted a Fire tv for Christmas from the grandparents. I had requested a Roku tv because I didn’t want Alexa and her spy crap near my child. How do I shut her off and make sure she’s not listening ever.
"I have two groups setup like so:  **Living room**  *Echo*  - ""heater"" (amazon smart plug)   **Bedroom**  *Echo dot*  - ""heater"" (alexa smart plug)  When I am in the bedroom and say ""turn on the heater"", she turns on the one in the living room! Why does it seem like smart groups is so buggy and doesn't function they way it should? I just added the smart plug for the heater in the living room, so maybe changing it's name to heater broke something, but I was under the impression that smart groups was supposed to solve this exact problem"
I was having trouble controlling the two dozen smart devices in the house. So much trouble that I said heck it and set up a family (just me and the wife) email account as the primary Prime account holder and no partner account. I even set up a separate Spotify account for the family email and linked it there.   I have not completed the transition yet and wanted to ask if anyone has done this yet and would advise against it.   Thanks in advanced!
"I say ""alexa play spotify"" Alexa says ""here is spotify""  And nothing plays.  It's the echo dot. And I have premuim. Can somone help me out. Links are appreciated"
"There once was a time when multi-room music was working and all was grand. Then one day it stopped working. A disturbance in the Force.  Setup: Echo Plus, Echo, Echo Show and Echo Dot. All are on the same SSID in the same house. For a year or more there was a multi-room music group that worked just fine. All devices were in the Downstairs group. Then one recent day, the Downstairs group multiplied as an option in the Spotify iPhone app. There were 2, then 3. I deleted the Downstairs group in the iPhone Alexa app, and tried to rebuild it.  Result: I am unable to select more than one Echo device at a time to add to any multi-room music group. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a list of things to try. None have worked.   Is this something for which there is a resolution? Some way to achieve balance, surrounding and binding the Echo world together again?"
" Finally have two EufyCam E's set up. The HomeBase is on my network using a wireless connection. I have no issues with any functionality inside the EufySecurity app.  In my Alexa app, I have the EufySecurity skill enabled and my Eufy account linked inside the app.  My two cameras are shown in the ""Devices"" list inside the Alexa app. When I tap on each device, the menu shows each device is ""Enabled"".  When I say ""Show me the front door"" into my phone, Alexa immediately says ""sorry, cameras don't work on this device"".  When I say ""Show me the front door"" into my FireStick TV remote, Alexa says ""OK.... front door is not responding"".  Any tips? I feel like I'm missing something very simple, but can't find any additional support on Eufy's website."
"I just said ""Alexa, get The Expanse"", hoping to get the Amazon Prime show to start playing. Instead, Alexa produced a string of seeming nonsense, which I've attempted to write down:  ""areas are floor area yorktown heights new york bandon slash east global common three parabar west central ohio worcester area cross sectional area global common one global common two masser iran ryparian buffer bandong slash north lenena square anthills""  Does anyone know what this means? It seems to be reproducible - I've asked two friends to check their devices, and Alexa says the same thing in response to ""Alexa, get The Expanse""."
So I just got my first Echo dot as I’m considering moving from Google. It’s been running sweet so far but now it’s just told me “someone is at the front door”.  I don’t have a smart doorbell or even any door sensors. What has caused this notification? I can’t seem to find a log for it.  Thanks in advance!
I recently bought the Echo Studio and it’s an awesome speaker!! I knew going into it that Amazon has a closed system in terms of allowing it to be a speaker for non fire televisions (ie BlueTooth connections). I really wish that was a feature they allowed. I know it’s probably a waste of time but anyone know where we can go to put in a feature request for this? It’s a shame this $200 can’t be utilized for television audio through Bluetooth because it sounds good!
"Hi guys,    After an amazon package is delivered my echo dot is flashing yellow. Not just after the delivery, but for the whole rest of the day. I know that I can disable this in the settings, but how do I just turn it off after the delivery?   I want Alexa to notify me when a package is delivered and then turn this yellow led of. Is this possible with a voice command?"
"When I try this it says ""sorry, but the hub that device TV connected to is not responding"".  ""Alexa, launch Netflix"" does turn on the TV and launch Netflix."
I have an a fire TV cube and swapped it out for the echo in my bedroom. I hate it. There are some cool features but they all take over the TV. For example I want to set my morning alarm but I do not want a prompt on the TV stopping my movie. I would like to link my echo and have it as the main with the fire TV. If I have them both they fight over each other with who hears what.
"Both me and my partner have a profile under my account, and both have the Alexa app on our phones, connected to the Echo device with our own “voice profiles”. And both of us have our own Spotify accounts linked to it on our Alexa apps.  However in an ideal world, for example, when I ask for my liked music I would like it to bring me specifically *my* liked music, and similar when my partner asks for hers. Is there a workaround for this? At the moment when either of us ask for liked music, it just plays mine presumably because I’m the device “owner”.   Also worth nothing that we have 2 separate Spotify accounts, not a family account or anything, as inefficient as that sounds."
Just for when you going in the room to grab something. So you don't have to say the command twice.
"I started with a big LIFX bulb, unaware there were minis available, which I found today and swapped over. I had the big one in a lamp, which was fine, but obviously the minis are much more suited to the situation.  The interesting thing is that by doing so, all the routines involving that first bulb, were affected, even though the new bulb would carry the same name once installed.  So I had to repair each routine one by one, and there were quite a lot. Fun ones, practical ones, ones which did the same thing but don't accept different inputs so are basically copies etc.  Glad it was just the one lamp.  This issue probably needs fixing."
"I'm not sure why, but lately I'm getting tongue tied.  ALEKSKA, TURN THE....D'OH!!!"
"We watch the show Schitt's Creek, and there's a character called Alexis. Whenever her mother says her name Alexa comes on, it's funny, it's only one character's voice that does it, it'll be the pronunciation of it, but it's cute."
"I have multiple echoes in the house and a spotify family account, plus a hue bridge and bulbs.  If one of my kids starts playing music in their room, my music stops. I believe that I have to set them up with separate accounts for their echo devices associated to their own spotify accounts (under my family account) BUT if i do that, they will no longer be able to control their lights as the hue bridge will still be on the main (downstairs) alexa account - or am i missing something?  Cheers for the help!"
"I have multiple echos in the house, all of them on one main music group except one for my kids that is their own thing. With Pandora Family I have an account setup for the house and each of my kids have an account for their tablets. When they play music on their echo it’s never been been an issue to listen to something else on the other group, and I’m assuming this is probably due to voice recognition on their Freetime accounts aeparating  I’m trying to make the switch to Spotify and it’s been a complete headache. And now all the echos are incapable of playing separate music. When they turn on music on theirs it stops all the other devices, and vice versa. Any advice on how to get around this issue?"
"I have a morning routine and I’d like to add the ramping brightness feature to it. However, I am unclear on if the ramping brightness would start at the time the routine starts OR if the ramping would start at the length of time I have specified (15 minutes) before the alarm?   Anyone have a clue?"
"We have prime The song Id skill is enabled. We don’t have amazon unlimited music We can play from Prime music  When we play from Prime music, it still doesn’t announce the song.   What am I doing wrong"
I can pause my roku but I can't resume. If I unpause it either resumes the previously played music or tells me it can't find anything to play music.
You might have to try it a couple of times but I found it to be weird.
"I use the brown noise setting for Sleep Sounds as my sleep noise maker.   It used to be a few weeks ago that when I woke up in the morning, I could just say ""Echo, stop!"" and it would acknowledge me and then stop playing. Now it acknowledges me and even says ""Thanks for using sleep sounds by Invoked Apps"" and pretends to stop, but the audio, brown noise, keeps playing.  I have to pull the power and reset the device to get it to stop. Can anyone suggest a permanent fix? I'd just like Stop to work as a valid function again.  I'm using an Echo Spot."
"I just got a Polk command bar and it allows me to add it to a speaker group on the Alexa app. But when I play to that group it doesn’t work. Amazon support said that function isn’t available in Australia, yet it allowed me to add the speaker to the group.   My alexas are having some other Spotify issues (saying Spotify isn’t available) so I’m not sure if it’s to do with that.   Does anyone know if this function works in Australia or when it will?"
All of my three echo dots plus new Polk command bar now say Spotify is unavailable on this device.   It’s still set up correctly in settings.   I’ve spent over an hour on the phone to amazon support a few days ago. They didn’t know what to do and said someone would get back to me in 24-48 hours and they haven’t.   What the hell? I’m so sick of these things playing up I’m seriously thinking of switching to google.
"I bought three echo shows for my family.  There are a few settings that I cant figure out.  1. When someone rings my front Ring doorbell, all the  shows are ringing and notifying.  I just want the main one in my house to wring/notify.  2. When one house calls the other, the ""caller id"" on the other show comes up as ""House."" For example I can tell one show to call ""Grandma Smith."" When any of the other shows get the incoming call, it shows ""House"" is calling and not ""Grandma Smith"".  When it is calling from the the show that is initiating the call, its shows ""Grandma Smith"" on the screen that is calling but the receiving show has a caller ID of ""House."""
I have Apple Music set to my default but Alexa still plays amazon music unless I specifically say Apple Music.  Anyone know how to make it actually default to the settings I’ve chosen?
"What is exactly the consequence of telling alexa that we like this song while she plays something from amazon music (basic service with prime)?  She says that she will remember that but what does it  actually do? She would play it more often? And more important - is there a list of songs I ""liked"" which we could edit or just wipe out? My kids keep likening songs which I don't want to be liked in any way ;) They probably don't like these songs either, they just like talking to Alexa ;)"
"Hello i have just purchased an Echo flex with the motion sensor adapter, with the idea of having it at the bottom of the stairs so that when it senses motion it automatically turns on the light at the top of the stairs. I managed to set it up to do that pretty easy but am struggling to find any type of timer option. So that it switches itself off after 30 minutes or something you know?   Was just wondering if anyone had any idea of how to do this?   Thanks in advance for any help or advice regarding this."
I recently received an echo dot (3rd gen) for xmas. I'm trying to link with my first gen fire tv stick and even with the name 'TV' its saying cannot find device.   BUT when I announce something.

"Hello everybody. I was gifted an echo show over the holidays and am loving it so far. I have been playing with routines and I was wondering if there was a way to have alexa announce if an alarm is set for the morning. I know I can say ""Alex what alarms are set"" or some other variation of that. However, I was wondering if there was a skill or IFTTT applet that would put it into a routine. Right now I have a routine set up for ""Alexa, Goodnight"" it turns off several of the lights in the house, turns on do not disturb and wishes me goodnight. I would like to add the alarm thing in there that says ""You have an alarm set for ....."" as part of the routine. so far my searches have come up empty. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you."
"Hello,  I’m trying to use Autovoice with the Echo Show 5 in Italy.  I wasn’t allowed to enable the Autovoice skill using my amazon.it account hence I created a brand new email and amazon.com account.  With this new account I’ve enabled Autovoice and linked it to the Autovoice email profile configured on my Android 9 S9+.  I’ve configured also a tasker profile to intercept Autovoice events to show a simple popup on my phone.  When I ask the Echo show 5  “Alexa ask Autovoice Hi” it responds “I don’t know that one”  I’ve tried to add the skill into my Android Alexa app but I cannot find the Autovoice skill.  I guess this could be the problem; on several Autovoice video with Alexa there wasn’t any hint to proceed to the Alexa app configuration.  My S9+ has English has main language.  The echo show 5 has been configured with English Language  Could you guys provide recommendations in order to let me use Alexa and Tasker/Autovoice integration?  The idea behind this configuration is to use an Android phone at home activated by Alexa voice commands.   Preferred language would be Italian but for my understanding I suppose it isn’t possible hence I’m already proceeding to configure everything in English.  Many thanks for your help.  Kind regards  Alex"
"I got two Echo dots for christmas and just picked up a regular echo (all gen 3). Earlier this week I had the two dots set up and I was able to navigate through the fire stick with ""Alexa, open netflix"" or ""Alexa, [play/pause/rewind 20 seconds]"" etc through the dot. When I set up the regular echo last night, I lost all of that control. I did link the echo to the firestick and also unlinked it to the dot as required, but now Alexa just says ""sorry dont know that one"" whenever I ask her to open Netflix, pause, play/resume, rewind, etc. Does anyone know how I can fix this? I had it working with the dots 20 minutes before I set up the echo. Definitely frustrating, but maybe I'm missing something?   Also, anyone know how I can get Alexa to turn the tv on thru the firestick? I have cec enabled on my hdmi ports and I turned it on by accident once with an announcement, but I havent been able to figure it out since. Thank you!"
I work for a local government that has public wifi requiring a password.  Can the Alexa be hooked up to it?  The instructions from Amazon did not help at all.  Thanks
"I'm trying to set up my Alexa to say welcome home, and tell me reminders and stuff when I get home. At what point in the 492 radius circle will she start speaking? Will she say ""Welcome home"" as soon as my car crosses over the edge of the circle or will she wait a minute and say it? I know I can also set the routine 5 minutes after I enter the radius, but by that point I'll probably be across the house."
"All of my devices (1 Echo and 3 Echo Dots) are down at the same time. I'm using the same WiFi from my laptop and smart phone that the Amazon devices have been using.

Anyone have one that works? please dont redirect me to tomato helper that skill stopped working a while back.
In my home I have gosund smart plugs and 2 echo shows. The plugs use an app call smart home that you have to use to connect them to the Alexa app.   Lately my living room lights group have just been turning off and on by themselves.  In the smart home app they aren’t grouped by room so I’m assuming it’s an Alexa issue. Anyone else have/fixed this problem?
"Do I need to keep the TP-Link Kasa app installed on my phone after getting the plug working with Alexa?  I'm trying to get everything in my house working with as few apps as possible, so if I'm required to keep their app indefinitely I'll probably just go with the Amazon plugs.  Thanks in advance!"

"Basically Im looking for a single page website if possible, but a website that's comprehensive works as well. But a listing of all or best one, for Alexa commands for my parents. Ive seen one or two that doesnt look like it would print well. But I'll take whatever suggestions you have.  Searching for if I can do a specific task won't be that beneficial, looking for already written commands."
"When I first connected my bluetooth speaker to Alexa, the volume was super low. I called Amazon CSR and they told me to factory reset the Echo. Luckliy, I found out about the ""Set Volume to X"" ... and that works! When I connect the b-speaker it changes the volume accordingly and rolls back to previous volume when device is disconnected. Wish the CSR had educated me on that."

The first night she said something like, “safety off” and the next it sounded like, “my friend, walkie walkie” or maybe walkie talkie. The phrase repeats after a short gap.   The only thing I’ve found online was a negative review for a Night Light app, which we don’t have enabled - it was doing something creepy that scared their kid. We did have the Night Night app enabled, which looks to be the same developer, but there is nothing in the activity log. I disabled the skill anyway.    We’re set up for Australia so she normally sounds like an Aussie, but this voice had an American accept, like Alexa sometimes uses when the connection is bad/offline and it apologises for not knowing/connecting.  Anyone have a clue what might be going on?"
"She just told me a story about a can of cranberry sauce, and it was funny and I tried to get her to tell it again but it didn’t work so I’m just wondering if anyone knows what story I’m talking about and if anyone knows how to ask her to tell it again tia"
"I’m having a really hard time getting Alexa to understand me properly when I’m asking her to play the video game music station “RadioSEGA” on TuneIn. It used to work fine, but as of a few weeks ago, it will assume I mean “Sega Radio” which is a very different station.   I can get around this usually in the Alexa App by just selecting it manually, but I’m trying to wake up to it as an alarm, and the app won’t let you change what the station is on alarms.  Is there another work around for this? Some way for it to know what I mean?"
"Hey r/alexa,  I have a few Alexa devices in my house. A echo dot, a show 5 and the fire cube. When I play music from either the dot or the show, I am able to control (pause/stop) the music from any other device. However, if I am playing music from my cube I am unable to control the music from the other devices. The response I am getting is either that device is not supported, or it cannot find a device to play music called the cube. I would like to be able to pause or continue playing music in that room from another room. Is the problem the cube? Is there a work around I can use?"
"Hello! Looking for some help with running an Alexa routine.  I'm trying to set it so my [Peteme smart bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/Multicolor-Google-Required-Equivalent-Changing/dp/B07QYMPT6W/) turn **orange red** when I ask Alexa to run a specific routine. However, [the Alexa app seems limited](https://imgur.com/a/xnjUt36) in terms of what colors the lights can be set to. When I specifically ask her to ""set my lights to orange red"", she does it without issue, so I figure it must be possible.  Is there any way to make this happen?"
"I purchased an Echo Show for my parents - one of the reasons I bought it for them was that I thought I could share an Amazon Photos album with them and then they could use those photos as their Echo wallpaper.  I do this at home with my Echo and an album I created.  I tried to set this up on my parents’ device, but there’s no option to select the shared photo album.  Is this really not possible?? This seems like such an oversight on Amazon’s part to not allow users to collaborate on a photo album and view across different Echo devices."
I’m curious whether or not I can have Alexa play the same movie or show on both my tv and my echo show simultaneously. Ideally while cooking I’d be able to walk from my living room to my kitchen and have the show playing on both so I don’t have to repeatedly pause.
Should Alexa be able to tell the difference between two users with the same phrases.  Example “Alexa Good Morning”.  My wife and I have set up same phrase but with different routines and traffic alerts.  We both have an amazon household and trained voice profiles.
"In the morning I say ""Alexa, Let's Rock"" to get the radio playing in the kitchen, but the music comes from my bedroom where my second dot is.  Well that hasn't happened before.  Cancels and retries.  Same  What the?  Unplugs second Alexa, retries.  Sound still comes from my room.  What the???  Turned out I'd forgotten about the bluetooth speaker I was recharging in there."
"I have an echo in every room/group in my house. I would like to have a routine that responds only to the room I’m in based on the echo I’m speaking to. For instance, let’s say I want a routine where I say “Alexa, blink the lights.”  I want it to blink the bedroom lights if I’m in the bedroom talking to the bedroom Alexa, or to blink the lights in the kitchen if I speak to the kitchen Alexa. I’m trying to avoid having the arduous group designation every time I issue a command.   Any ideas?  Thanks!"
"I recently purchased a couple Alexa devices for my parents house, including one for my room and one for the kitchen. In the evening I’ll be at my desk and say *quietly* “Alexa, play my liked music on Spotify”. Even though I’m on the opposite side of the house and they’re connected to two different amazon accounts, my music will play on the kitchen echo instead of my own. Has anyone else experienced this problem? It’s getting to be annoying."
Is there any type of device that can be installed in a ceiling fan that will allow Alexa to control it? Thanks
"So i bought both Echo Show 5 and FireStick TV from the [Amazon.es](https://Amazon.es), since I live in Portugal.   Everything works fine besides using voice Alexa to play Tv Shows/movies on streaming apps such as Netflix or Amazon Video.   Instead of start playing the show when i say ""Alexa, play/watch \*show\* on Netflix/Prime Video"" it just searches the name of the show on the firestick. However, when I ask it to play a prime video show on the Echo Show 5 itself, it starts playing just fine.   After various conversations with Amazon Support, they told me that my fire stick was restricted to Spain (so the voice commands wouldn't work and intended) and that I Would have to buy it from [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) in order to get an international one. Is there any way to go arround this?"
"Well I'm not sure it can do what I want it to do... I have a ""smart"" TV (brand new Samsung Q60R but its smart functions are so limited I had to plug in my old Fire stick) that has of course it's own sound as well as an attached sound bar. I'd LIKE to be able to use the two echos I have in the kitchen/living room to add to the TV/soundbar, but so far I haven't been successful.  So far I tried making a ""home theatre""/Audio system; I could hook up ONE of the echos to the TV... however, it apparently mutes the TV sound, which in turn mutes the soundbar. So my TV sound is restricted to a single echo dot.   Really? There's no way to get the TV sound AND the sound through the echos? I suppose I need an Alexa-compatible sound bar?  Of course if the TV itself did what it was promised and functioned as a Fire TV as it was advertised, I don't think I'd have this problem, but that's another story..."
"Hey all. I have pondered this for many a times and have not come up with any answers. I spoke with Amazon directly they basically tell me that I cannot do what I want to accomplish. I figured this is the best place for advice at this point.  My setup is as follows. I have many echo devices. An echo dot in my daughters room, her makeup room, and one in our kids' game/tv room. I also have an echo dot in my basement, connected to an amp that allows me to stream music from my phone/spotify acct to my outdoor speakers. My son has a Echo Show 5 in his bedroom, I have an echo show 5 in the kitchen, and we also have an older Echo speaker in our bedroom. I have all this connected to my smart home which is controlled through my phone with Apple Homekit and voice control using Alexa.  Overall we have 5 people in our house. I have profiles setup for myself and my wife however I am unable to include my kids into the mix. The main issue lies in music... Currently all the echos are under my profile however if I'm listening to my spotify account ( say in my car) and my kids want to listen to music at home, then it disconnects me and switches the music to their echo station. I pay for the family spotify premium so I need to allow my echos attach to different accounts.  Is there a way to accomplish all this and keep the ecosystem under my main profile or do I need to opening separate amazon accounts for my wife and kids, and set their echos up separately under their usernames. And if so, how can I be the main controller of all the devices since they are all under my house?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks for all your help"
"I recently changed the location of my Alexa Echo Dot. But since it’s a new WiFi, it will let me select the WiFi in setup mode but it won’t allow me to put in the password for it in order to connect. So is there anyway I can change the WiFi?"

"So, bought a new TV over the holidays. TCL Roku TV. When I go through the Roku skill to search for devices it only recognizes a Roku box that we bought, 2 years ago. It doesn’t recognize the new TV or the stick we bought 3 months ago.   Not a huge deal, but was just curious if anyone else has had this issue? I’m guessing it’s a problem with the actual  skill and not my devices."
"As the title says, I have a Ring video doorbell linked to Alexa.  I have set up a routine to turn the porch light on (smart switch) with motion.  But, I can't find a way to have it so it turns back off after a few minutes.  Any ideas?  Thanks in advance."
I just started using the Alexa app more for some of my simple automations and now finding I want to do somewhat more advanced things like logical functions for triggers.  Examples:  When it's 9am OR I leave the house do ______.   When I say Alexa play music AND it's after 8pm set lights to certain color and brightness OR if it's before 8pm set lights to different color and brightness.  I also run Smartthings app which also does not allow nested logical functions very well. Yes I use webcore too but find it overkill for those medium complexity automations.  I miss Stringify!

"New Alexa User Here, just linked up my Premium Spotify account.   When I ask: ""Alexa, play the album What You See Is What You Get by Luke Combs"" it plays the SONG ""What You See Is What You Get"". When I say next song, it stops playing all together, I assume because it is playing a song instead of an album.   In fact, getting Alexa to play from Spotify is pretty brutal in general. A lot of times it doesn't play anything at all.    Any tips?"
"Hey there, first post. I currently own an alternative to the official Echo speaker, a Magnavox MSH315V, with built-in Alexa features. Why this choice? Louder volume that can surround my whole house without having to pay extra money for the Echo Plus.  Problem is I live with somebody named Alexis, which is often confused with Alexa, and this triggers my speaker. I've tried to find a way to change the wake word, but instead can't because it's an 'unsupported device', meaning the speaker is only limited to most but not all features.   Is there a workaround for this?"

"So yes, this happened.  My sisters boy friend is named Don as is MIL deceased husband.  Two Dons.  Recently I was messing around with the settings on my Alexa and saw ‘Don’s Device’ under ‘My Devices’ so naturally I messed with it (thinking if it was my sisters boyfriends).  It turns out it wasn’t.  So I mentioned it to MIL few days later and she was gobsmacked that I could do that.    I have no idea how her Alexa was on my settings.  Only thing I could think of was I “invited” her to share our Amazon Prime and I guess they sent her an email.  Don’t know if she did anything about it or not.    Sooo this Sunday just passed, she asked me if I could not have her name on my Alexa so I had a look at the app and it said ‘deregister device’ next to her (husbands) name. I deregistered it and that was it until this morning.  She called and said her Alexa wouldn’t play. Ah shit,  so does anyone have any idea/help/advice on how to solve this.  Thank you and sorry this post is so long."
"This might be a long shot. I've got a security camera that's supported by Alexa, and I'm currently in the market for an Amazon screen device that can enable Echo integration of the cam (i.e. 2-way voice, live video). In browsing options, I'm not clear on whether these integrated capabilities are offered only through Echo devices (Show, Spot), or whether other Amazon tablet options also support these features.   Ideally I'd prefer a tablet that can support these integrated features, while also able to do normal tablet stuff (Hulu). Are any of the Fire devices capable of this? Or any other devices?"
"Issue in the UK. Up until today, saying “Alexa, play Heart” would get me “Heart (local version) from Global Player”. Now, if I ask “Alexa, play Heart” it defaults to a Filipino station called “Pinoy Heart” played on TuneIn.   I don’t want TuneIn, nor do I want any Filipino stations. Can I delete TuneIn as an option somehow? It doesn’t seem to have a skill."

"Good Morning, Hoping this community might be able to assist as I’ve hit a wall on this, I have an Alexa in my dining room and a echo in the bedroom (both relatively new and latest models). In the past I created a group that allowed my music to play on both, for Christmas this year my wife got me a Sonos Beam to go with our new TV based partially on what she read online indicating we could add that to our audio group to facilitate whole house music. I have been unable to get this to work despite the majority of what I read online suggesting it’s pretty straightforward. All 3 are on the same WiFi network and I can control my Sonos with Alexa. When I go into the app I can group the Alexa and the echo or I can group the Sonos with other items but I can’t get them to group together. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated."

"I can only seem to get it to work if someone sends me a message via the alexa app as an announcement or drop in. It would be cool if it could be setup to work with other notifications like if I have new instagram likes, etc."

I've set up a group and a speaker group with both devices. I set the preferred speaker for each individual echo, and the group they're in to use the everywhere speaker group.  No matter what I do, I cannot get my pod to play on both devices at the same time.

"I do not see ""Alexa, I'm home"" in my list of routines, but when I say it, it works.  I'm integrated with ADT via the ""Guard"" feature so she asks me to confirm my disarm code.  It's cool, but I'd also like to edit the routine to automatically turn on some of my connect lights.  But, given that it's not shown in my list of routines, I don't know how to edit it.  When I go to create new routines, the ""Guard"" feature only has an option to set Guard to Away, there's no option it seems to create a routine with set Guard to Home, so I can't just create a secondary routine.  Any tips?  Should I see an option in routines to set Guard to Home?  Do I have something set wrong?"
"I recently got some hue lights for my house. I installed two of the lights in my kitchen and they work fine. The thing is that I have to tell Alexa to turn on kitchen light 1 and then light 2. If I tell her to turn on the kitchen lights she responds by saying kitchen does not support that. I was wondering if there was a way to pair them so she turns both of them on simultaneously, instead one at a time."
"Hello,  I have Apple Music and it seems to work on all my echo dots as it’s enabled in the Alexa app and listed as the default.  For some reason echo show (2nd gen) I think it’s 2nd gen will only play amazon music.  Any way to get the show to play Apple Music instead?"
"I was gifted some smart plugs from a company called Atomi for Christmas and I just got around to setting it up. I had to download their app to get the devices set up and I noticed they don’t have voice command that would work with Siri for example, so I also downloaded the Amazon Alexa app and connected my devices there.   Is there a way I can activate Amazon Alexa app with just voice control without opening the app? If the only solution is to open the app on my phone and then do the voice command it seems a bit pointless cause at that point I could just push the button to turn it off.   I don’t own any smart assistant devices btw like echo dot and tbh I don’t really plan to.   Thank you!"
"I’ve had an Echo Show for a long time and this Christmas we decided to get echo dots for the kids. Both of them have been setup with the free Freetime  control under my Amazon account.   What I’ve come to realize is that if kid 1 plays a song on echo 1, when kid 2 tries to play a song on Echo 2, Alexa says that a music stream is already active and if we want it to stop (on Echo 1).   This is a pain but I can see why Amazon is locking 1 stream per account.   My question is... what service to I need to pay Jeff Bezos for so that kid 1 and kid 2 can stream music at the same time on each of their echos?   It is my understanding that if I get a Prime Music family plan, I can have up to 6 streams as long as each family member has their own amazon account, but... Amazon doesn’t let you create an account for a child until said child is 13 years old...  What options are there for kids under 13?"
Hello all. I have a 2 person Amazon household. My partner has their iCloud calendar linked and for whatever reason it is not allowing me to link my iCloud calendar. I get no option to input my app specific password and actually the only option it gives me is to unlink. I click it and it says it is unable to unlink at this time.

This is an annoying issue I have. I could be listening to 'sorry' by Justin Beaver on spotify and I all of the sudden think of a song I want to play. So I say to Alexa play 'baby shark' and it says 'playing baby shark on spotify' then resumes playing 'sorry.' It does this with any and every song. It's so annoying and I can't find any other post on this. Did Amazon send me a naughty Alexa?
"So, in my bedroom I have my personal Echo Dot set up with my Amazon account and I already have some LED strip lights and a smart plug linked to it. my mom is getting a Dot (for the living room) and Show (for the kitchen) soon and she plans on linking them to her own account. My question is: can I link the wifi devices already paired with my Alexa with hers even though they're on different Amazon accounts or do all the devices have to be on the same Amazon account for that to work? So I could turn on my bedroom from the living room or kitchen."
Unable to skip a song on Spotify Premium using  Amazon Echo Dot.  alexa claims that it is not supported. My location is set for US and my default player has been set as spotify. any help to solve this very annoying bug.
"Hi! So before, I had an echo dot (3rd gen) that would have an alarm set to a specific song on Spotify. It worked flawlessly. Now, I upgraded to an Echo Show 5 and my alarms play whatever it pleases pretty much. Seems like it pulls up Spotify (the last recently played song) and just starts playing that and ignores the setup I have in the Alexa app. The alexa app shows ""\*song title\* from Spotify"" yet it will never actually play the song. I've tried everything but to no avail. Recreating the alarm by telling Alexa ""set alarm to this song"" or ""set alarm to \*song title\*"" is not a problem as Alexa confirms the alarm with the song choice, and again displays correctly in the Alexa app. It just never plays! Any advice for this?"
"One of the news feed items on my Echo Show this morning read, “YouTube now available on Echo Show.” Did something change? When I asked it to download a YouTube skill, it couldn’t find one. When I asked it to open YouTube, it simply opened a browser and navigated to the YouTube website. I was hoping for an app or something where it would be completely voice activated/controlled. Having to tap out things on the screen isn’t ideal. So, what’s new? Nothing?"
I’m trying to get into Alexa Guard but I can’t even see the “Guard” tab under settings in the App? I currently have a full ring alarm set up and made sure the Alexa app itself is also updated. Anyone else have this issue or know a fix?

"Hey guys, wondered if any of you fine people can shed a light on something for me.   The echo dot in my bedroom is connected to a pair of Sonos Play:1s. All music is piped through those.   Generally, when I make music requests it plays from my connected Spotify account.   I’ve noticed that when I request music via Alexa from Apple Music, I typically get the response that Alexa can’t find the specific album on Apple Music.   As soon as I disconnect the Sonos speakers from the Alexa, it has no issues playing the requested music.   Oddly, the only curveball from this is when I ask Alexa to “play some music i’d like from Apple Music”, in this scenario it plays a variety of tracks which I have liked via the Sonos Speakers.   Thanks all, please no Apple Music hating."
"I have some routines that have ""report weather"" as part of the routine, and every time any of my Echo Dots get to that command it just stops speaking, doesn't give the weather report, and doesn't finish the routine. If I ask her ""What's the weather?"" she answers like regular, but the ""report weather"" is specifically not working. Is there a workaround?"
"This review is about the Arlec Grid Connect, which supposedly works with Alexa.  I rarely find something which just doesn't work, often when that's the case it's due to me missing an instruction, but that's not the case here.  As you know I've been ""smartyfying"" my house, so that light and sound come on with a command, it feels very science fiction, and not so far off what Picard was using on the Enterprise (and Kirk before him).  So far it's mostly been about speakers, light globes and plugs. But I would like to expand my options later.  Yesterday at Bunnings, I saw a pack of two bulbs and two connectors, for about $40. Now considering that one smart plug alone is generally worth about $25, I thought this seemed like it might be good value.  The brand in question is the Arlec Grid Connect.   So although I was after another brand, which has worked well, but had sold out, I bought this instead.  Now the routine for setting up these bits and bobs goes like this.  Plug it in.  Download the product's app and sign in.  Use bluetooth (sometimes) to pair with your phone or tablet.  Use the Alexa/Google Home app to connect your new device.  At this point, after about five minutes of your time, it's done. Not quite as easy as screwing in a new bulb, but it works, and it puts a smile on your dial.  But what's going on here is that while the app is finding the plug, Alexa cannot.  Not only that, but if the power goes off, the plug appears to suffer from amnesia and needs to be set up again from scratch.  If you wanted the switch to be a fancy plug with a cool looking blue light, with hints of WiFi, this might be perfect for you, but if you're setting up a serious smart home, don't bother.

"Looking to buy an Echo dot (3rd gen), and a hue bulb.   Do I need a hue bridge to connect a single hue bulb to an echo dot?

Can I connect a WiFi bulb straight to the echo dot?"

"So, I have an Echo Auto and when I say ""Alexa, next"" the majority of the time she'll say ""Sorry, I can't skip to the next song."" (Or something like it I can't remember)   Please help"
I got an echo dot to put on my front porch that I basically just want to use for music. Can I disable its access to the smart home features in my house. I don’t want anyone that walks up to my front door to be able to just tell it to turn on/off items in my home or unlock the door.
Is there a way I can set my Show 5 to play white noise while keeping the display set to the clock face?
"I got an alexa and firestick for xmas, they are both set up and connected to one another but it won't turn on and off when requested. I have enabled the CEC on the tv. Any ideas?"
"So I share a Amazon prime account with a family member who lives in another house.  We both recently got echo devices and obviously the Alexa app.  I am able to see her Alexa devices in my Alexa app and vice versa.  I also get her Amazon notifications on my echo device.   It's very annoying.  We have separate login information for our Amazon accounts and our Alexa enabled devices are registered at our respective physical locations.   Any ideas on how to change settings, somewhere, so we don't see each other's stuff, nor get each other's notifications??   Thanks..."
Anyone know a good way to do this and get random results each time? I asked 'what restaurants are near me?' and sometimes she'll just list the same 3 over and over  I have a hard time deciding where to eat
"So much, that im thinking about swapping to google.   This happens all the time... ""alexa, play spotify"" - ""playing spotify""..... wait.... nothing. Doesnt play. I end up using my phone which 80% works  ""Alexa, play The Beatles - let it be""  ""Playing the NEW Beatles"" Yes alexa... play a cover band. WTF.   ""Alexa, play John Lennon, Jealous Guy"" ""Playing John Lennon, Jealous Guy TAKE 10""  Who the fuck wants to listen to TAKE 10.   It seems to be getting worst. Works fine on Google."
"Previously my Echo dot played songs fine via my Spotify account.   Now I ask “Alexa, play (says song)”.   Alexa then states she is playing the song that I asked for via Spotify, but when the song starts it’s the last song that played/currently playing)   Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."
"I feel like I’m missing something obvious.   My primary is an Echo. I have a dot upstair, as well as fire sticks in my living room and bedroom. When I create a group called Everywhere it allows me to add all my devices except my primary echo. So if I ask it to play music everywhere it plays on my dot upstairs and my TVs bit not my primary echo.   What am I missing? Why can’t I add both echo and echo dot to the group?"
"Title basically spells it out, but will expand on specifics.  I have an Alexa device in basically every room and have speaker groups set up (e.g., upstairs, down stairs, everywhere) and can't figure out how to add the Portal I have in the kitchen to any of the groups.  Any ideas?  Is this even possible?  Thanks."
"Two years later and I still cant get a gen 1 Alexa to display display the date (without asking). It has time and temp on the home screen, no date. Has Amazon ever responded as to why they never added this feature? The Show 5 (a fraction of the price and smaller screen) stock photo proudly displays a date function. Why are they ignoring original customers and such a basic feature?  Also, lately it is asking all kinds of ""follow up"" questions that it never did before. Apparently there is no obvious way to turn those off either? Example: I ask about the weather and it asks me if I want to know the weekend weather too? Why would they not make something like that optional, unless I am missing it?"
"I want the game score screen to be persistent during the game like it is when you ask, ""alexa, what's the score of the Ravens game?"""
"We're wanting to use our echo buttons for a trivia game, but we have the questions on cards and want to take turns with different people reading the questions while others buzz in.  We don't want to type all 500 questions into the app, and it would ruin the game for whoever got stuck typing in all the questions as they would see them in advance.  Is there a way to set the buttons up to allow us to use them as game buzzers without all of the questions and other stuff?  Even one that might simulate a countdown and then quickest to hit a button would be great.  (e.g. Alexa counts down ""3... 2... 1..."" then the buttons enable and fastest to hit it ""wins"" and would let us see who hit the button first)"
"My dad has amazon prime, I “use his account” as I’m set up as a family member on it. We both have an Alexa at our own places and now our accounts are linked. I can play music on his device and we also receive notifications for when the other receives an amazon package. Is there a way to unlink these on our Alexa apps?"
Talk about creepy. My echo show just started playing music out of the blue. I looked at the activity in the app and there isn’t any activity in a couple hours. What gives?
"Hello! My in-laws added speakers to their pool room and I’m curious if I can add an Alexa to drive the audio - hands free music from the pool would be amazing.

Thanks in advance!"
Share with me your solutions for getting Alexa into a UK bathroom.   Thinking about powering from the loft and drilling a hole in the ceiling to a mounted echo/Sonos but not sure this would meet UK electrical standards.
"So, my parents both got an Alexa device for Christmas. An Echo and an Echo Dot, both ordered from my mum's Amazon account.   I was enlisted in setting them up. Downloaded the app onto their phones, paired the echo on my dad's phone and the dot on my mum's phone. They each have their own Spotify account so I linked that as well. They worked fine. We could have dad's playing the Beatles in one room and mum playing Franki Valli in another.  This is where it goes wrong. Mum wanted to be able to play the same music at the same time on both devices so we set up a group, which worked and we could get them to play throughout the house.  But can we for the life of us get them to separate again, no. I have tried making my dad his own Amazon account and adding just the Echo. Even going through Spotify and saying play on Echo will then cut off what is playing on the other device even though they're separate Spotify accounts.   PLEASE someone have an answer or both Alexa's are going to get thrown out the window and neither of them will play any music."
What are some really good games on the echo?
"Earlier in the day I asked Alexa something and fudged what I was asking, then Alexa said that I could adjust bass, mid range (I think), and treble. Which had nothing to do with what I was asking about.  However I found that interesting and thought the controls for that must be on the app.  Well, if they are, I cannot find them, how about you?"
"Hi! Hopefully this question isn't against the rules.  Just bought Echo Dot Gen 3 and noticed that some parts of the app are in Japanese (I'm not associated to the language or country in any way). No mention of Japan on the settings so not sure where this is coming from. Even Help &amp; Feedback is in Japanese so unable to proceed. Is it a faulty product and should I return it?  Appreciate all replies, thank you!"
Alexa suggests that by giving up booze couples can afford a vacation with the money they save.  My wife has agreed not to drink on New Year's Eve.   So I've booked a round the world cruise.
"This is insanely infuriating. I have 2 dots and a show connected to 8 hue lights and a thermostat. At any given point I have 1-3 lights showing as unresponsive, sometimes the living room or maybe the baby’s room or maybe the front door, it seems to change randomly.  I just ordered another dot and my husband was going to install 2 more switches to control other lights but I’m not sure if it’s worth it since the connections seem to come and go. I’m almost to the point that I want to take it all back. Does anyone else have a similar experience or suggestions?"
Help please?
I’ve had an echo dot for about a year but never considered this before now. Could I tell Alexa to play a certain song/playlist at a certain time?   E.g. Telling Alexa to play a song at the same time to wake up to everyday
"In the last week or so, Alexa has stopped responding to my usual commands like ""bedroom fan on."" She now responds with, ""I don't know how to set bedroom fan to that setting.""   I've had to start being more wordy, such as saying, ""turn the bedroom fan on."" This is irksome. Has anyone else had this happen recently?"
"I wanted to know if it were possible to use a skill based on a voice.   e.g. Xbox Skill, If I tell Alexa to turn in on/off it should work but if someone else in the house says it, it should not  Is this possible?"
"I don't usually have wifi or bluetooth running on my phone, as it tends to drain the battery.  I don't generally go out due to health issues, so my phone is rarely used at all, I do most of my stuff on a tablet.  But I'd made a shopping list using Alexa and before I went shopping I turned the WiFi on expecting that things would just update, giving me the full list.  But it didn't, so that was frustrating.  Yes I should've checked before I left, but you know, rush rush rush."
"Is it possible to have alexa cycle through light colors (I have the Philips Hue bulb, and an Iphone 8+). Kind of light RGB lighting on a keyboard or mouse. If not, its not a big deal, I’m not looking for a super long process.  I program code btw"
I live with my gf and her father. They can both turn the lights on and off with their phones. As well as look at the various routines that have been programmed in. I do not. This is frustrating to me. They dont mind adding me to the system. But it seems there is a max of 2. What are my options?
"Hi, new here.  I have several echo devices and wished to have a doorbell video to see who rang the door.  I bought a ring.  Well, alexa will tell me if there is motion outside and if someone is ringing the doorbell, with it ringing itself.  Why is there not an option to have the camera turn on for my echo, for one or both notifications?   One has to ask ""A: to show the camera.  By the time all that takes place certainly the motion option activity has left.  Has anyone corrected this for people who wish to have the camera turned on automatically when activities are detected?   Thanks  Jerry."
Is there a free music service that works with Alexa so I can listen to any song I want to without paying a single penny?
Does anyone know if I can create multiple custom responses to the same question for an Alexa Blueprint? In the custom Q&amp;A blueprint it only seems to allow 1 Alexa response to the question. Thanks!
"Alexa is really stimulating my laziness and I’m thinking of setting up to control rgb lights with motion sensors. What I don’t want however is say a dim light is set to come on if I walk into my kitchen at 1am, but the same happens every five minutes when we have people over and we are all in the kitchen.      Do routines have an ‘if function’ that allows me to stop it from triggering if the lights are already on?"
My name is KyLei (my mom thought she was being cool) My Alexa pronounces it KayWhyLay Is there a way to fix that? Or do I need to edit my name to a more traditional spelling?
"Is there a way to set up multiple activation phrases for routines? There’s that one blueprint where you can have her answer questions or whatever with what you want her to say, and you can have variations in the question. (Example: What time is it/ how early is it/ how late is it/ etc all answer with ‘Its time for you to get a watch’ but you only set up one blueprint) Is there a way to do that for routines? Or copy routines to make multiple activation phrases but the same routine? Or do you have to redo everything manually?"

"So I finally took the plunge and bought 4 Alexa devices for Xmas: 2 dots, 1 Echo Plus, and 1 Echo Show.  The Echo Show (8 inch) is for my mother-in-law, who lives with us.  I have a couple of questions about the best way to set these up.    Would it be advisable to set up the Echo Show separately, on my mother-in-law's own Amazon account?  (I'm pretty sure she has one).  My MIL is slightly demented, and I'm hopeful she will enjoy interacting with Alexa, doing things like asking for the weather forecast, asking to be woken up at 8:30 AM, or whatever. Plus, I'd like to use it as an intercom to other areas of the house. HOWEVER, as I've said, she is slightly demented and ***EXTREMELY*** dependent on my wife and I. So I don't want her to get *too* carried away with the intercom function. Basically, I'm wondering about the pros and cons of setting up her device on a separate account, and if I do so, will that actually prevent functionality such as the intercom.   The other three devices will go on mine and my wife's Amazon account.  The only other ""smart"" devices I have at the moment are two light switches (the switches themselves, wired into the wall), and 4 smart plugs that I bought for Xmas and haven't hooked up yet. Oh, I also have three Roku TV's that I plan to use with Alexa.    Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you!"

"Yesterday I got an Amazon Echo Dot 3rd and get my free 14 days trial of Amazon Music Unlimited. This 14 days doesn't need billing data.  But I can get 30 days, or better, 90 days for the promotion, but you should add the billing information. Of course, you could cancel the renew and you will not be charged.  My question is: in day 100, is it possible that if someone in the house ask for music the Echo Dot, the Echo Dot say something about Amazon Music Unlimited and with one ""Yes"" you will be again subscribed, and now billed, to Amazon Music Unlimited? Or I will need to go to the web to re-enable my subscription?"
"So, sometimes, when I’m listening to Amazon Music Unlimited on my Echo, I can say, “Alexa, when was this released?” However, this is very inconsisent and only rarely works. Otherwise, I get some completely irrelevant information.  So, does anyone know the thing to say to get the consistent narration of the year of a song’s release?  Thanks."
"I need to change my phone number associated with my Alexa account. When I go into settings to change it, it says to call customer services but I can’t find a way to contact them. I’ve tried to go through the Amazon app but there’s nothing for changing a phone number.  Anyone managed to achieve this?"
"Using Alexa Dots and loving them.  Filling my house with smart things. Bulbs(4), outlets(16), switches(6), alarm system, garage door, Apple TV...  All working well.    No hubs.  All connected directly to my network.  Is this going to be an issue as I grow my smart home?  Should I buy a hub?  Can devices designed to direct connect to the network work with a hub?  Should I just buy an additional switch if I notice performance issues?  Maybe I can just get off my recliner and flip the switch but it is pretty awesome having a smart house. Even if I am a few bits short of a byte."
Hi Guys -  I am just wondering if I can install Alexa in each of the rooms of my Mom's B&amp;B?  Will I violate customers privacy?
"Are there any such skills? Sorry, I'm new to Alexa (dot) and find it pretty difficult to find things I would be interested in.  Is there a skill that helps you find you phone without having to buy a device from amazon (such as pebblebe or tile)? Find my phone seems to only work with Android, but I need one for IOS.  I would like a background noise of people chatting away. I tried coffesshop, but I don't like that there is music there as well.  I would like to be able to dictate three-four sentences daily - kind of journaling. If anyone knows of a skill...  Oh, and it seems that I cannot get everything there is on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com), because I have an [amazon.co.uk](https://amazon.co.uk) account.  TIA"
"Last night I was watching a video where someone said that you could force an update by pressing the mic off button. Alexa then goes red and apparently if there's an update,it will download it after about three minutes have passed.  But I wondered if you could ask it if there was an update, so I tried that and it worked. Although there was no update available.  I'd like to know what happens if there is one.  I assume it would ask if you want to set it up."
Are we AleXaphiles ?
"I got one for christmas, but I don't listen to music and I don't have a smart home. I'm quite lost on what useful things I can do with Alexa.  Is there a list of the best useful skills? The ones I found all seem to focus on music or smart home with very very little other useful skills.  TIA"

"Alexa, who dis? I admit this is silly, but I often ask Alexa to tell me what song is playing. I would like to create a quicker phrase I can use then ""what song is this."" I was thinking maybe I could make a routine that I can invoke, but I can't find a way to tell Alexa to name the song thats playing from within the routine. I am aware of SongId, but I don't like to listen with that enabled, and I couldn't see a way to enable it in a routine either.  Thanks for any help."
"I have a routine that includes a 30 minute Wait.  While the routine is running, is there any way to find out how much time is left before the Wait completes?  I tried the a couple of commands, like ""Alexa, how much time is left on the Wait?"" and ""Alexa, when did the X routine start?"" - but everything I have tried has just caused Alexa to e-shrug.  I have also tried to ask questions like ""Alexa, are any routines running?"" - but I got nowhere."

I have an older relative that got an echo dot for Christmas and they already have a fire tablet which I was able to do the initial setup with. The problem is they only have a landline phone so I'm not sure if there's any way they can initiate or receive calls and/or drop ins from other relatives with Echos (and smartphones). When I look through the Alexa app it would appear that at minimum an SMS enabled phone is required. Does anyone know if there is a way to set up that feature without a registered phone on the account?
"I think I'm being thick - but when I ask Alexa to add an item to my shopping or to-do list, it's automatically marked as completed. This means that when I ask her to read out my to-do list she says it's empty. I can't seem to find anything about this online either which is strange."

My son and daughter got echo dots for Christmas and I'm wondering how I need to set them up. Currently I have them setup under my Alexa account but when they ask Alexa to play music it plays from my Spotify or Amazon music account. I want it to play from their Spotify account and not mine. Should I have them create Alexa accounts and set up the echo dots that way? If we do this will I lose any of the household features like announcements or drop ins?
Alexa’s importing and syncing of contacts is the most messed up invasion of privacy that I see with any smart device.   I setup an Echo Show 8 for for my Aunt but accidentally accepted the sync with phone (iOS) which brought in MY 2000 contacts into her Alexa account. I turned that off quickly but Now I cant find a way to remove all those contacts in one shot except one by one ! Any help would be appreciated.

I want to use the alexa app to be able to just use my voice to switch music and all, but when I do that, the music doesn't play through the Amazon Music App, which shows the HD or Ultra HD quality. The music, instead, plays through the Alexa app, and doesn't give any information on the quality.  I'm wondering if it is still playing the HD &amp; Ultra HD versions, or if it's just playing what Amazon Music would regularly play if one was not subbed to the HD version?

"I'm trying to set a reminder to take my puppy (Goose) out before it gets dark but Alexa keeps saying *""Gus""* even when I give my lowest throatiest ""Gooooose."" How does she not understand the word Goose? Like goose is common enough when it comes to animals, nursery rhymes, and food right?"
"Hi. We recently got 3 Amazon Echo devices in the house, 2 for kids (so they get one each) and one for adults. For some reason when one user starts playing a song from their bedroom, it’ll stop the other devices and play the song in a different room, even if one uses Amazon Music and another uses Spotify. It was a similar issue with listening to Audible Stories. One would start, then the story would stop when another user wanted to listen to music on a separate device. I’ve made sure multi room is turned off. Is there a setting or something I’ve missed?  Also I signed up for a free trial of Amazon music Family, in the hope that the children (aged 8 and 6) can listen to music independently. The youngest user setting for an account is 13 years old, and I don’t really want them upgraded to a 13 account in case they start making purchases. Is there another way around having many users accessing Amazon music?   Thanks for reading."
"I'm a recent convert to Alexa from Google. For the longest time, when you'd ask Google to, say, ""turn off bedroom lights"", she'd respond with ""okay, turning off bedroom lights"". It eventually changed to where she responded with just a beep, acknowledging that the command was received.  Can Alexa do this as well? ""Okay!"" is better than repeating what I asked, but I'd still like it disabled. I'm okay with the ring light on my Dots, and the screen on my Shows, but I'd like her to not audibly respond to the command."

"Hello,  I know this is a basic question but I’ve read conflicting info on this and was hoping to learn from this community what is actually accurate as of this point in time (end of 2019).  I used Alexa a few years ago but ended up switching to Google Assistant as it worked better for our devices at that point. However, I’m considering adding Alexa for a few of those items that don’t support GA. I’m wondering, can I simply use the Alexa app on iOS or Android to go voice commands when I need that? Or can I only get voice control by going through an Alexa speaker for FireTV device? Has the app moved on in functionality from simply a setup app to actually allowing voice control via smartphones?  Thanks so much in advance! Looking forward to learning from your replies. :)"

Now it said something like 'we are having trouble try again later' and there was a red ring.   Does anyone know how to fix this?"
Alexa was working great for playing Pandora. Nowfor about the last month it keeps playing random crap from TuneIn which I've never even heard of until this problem started. Now I can no longer get it to play any of my Pandora stations. Anyone else having this problem? Any recommended solutions?
I have two echo dots at home and I'm wondering how I could use Amazon Music as default on one and on the other one use Spotify.
"Because if you can I'm about to return two Nest Home Max's which don't seem capable of that...  We purchased one for us and one for my MIL because we wanted our kids to be able to easily video call her, but after hours of trying to get it to work it doesn't seem possible.   Ready to ditch google if Alexa can do it easily."
"Ok, so I have a free Spotify account tied to my Amazon echo. I created a playlist and am trying to get the echo to play it. However, rather than playing the playlist, it plays a station instead. I've tried renaming the playlist several times but nothing changed. What I want to know: Do I need a Spotify premium account to play my specific playlist or is this a bug? Thanks!"
"Okay, i’m certain this is going to be a daft question to many of the members of this subreddit.   I’m based in the UK and recently discovered that my Echo dots can make calls (not sure about receiving them yet).   I don’t understand how this technology works though as none of my echos contain a SIM card.   Could it be a bit like iMessage on iOS where an email address is paired with a phone number?  When Alexa makes a call it doesn’t seem to be using my phone in any capacity. 📱 🤷🏼‍♂️  I’m baffled."
It seems that any word appearing in the Urban Dictionary gets turned into **** stars in my shopping list.  It seems to really go after my hardware store items such as wood screws and door knobs.  Any way to turn this off?
"My neighbor is 88 years old and has fallen 3 times. Always in the middle of the night when he is attempting to use the bathroom. When he is sleeping his blood pressure slows down and when he gets up he loses his balance and falls.  Mostly he wears a device around his neck and he can push it and summon help. Once he fell forward and hit his forehead on the ceramic cup holder. It took ten stitches to close the wound and a couple of hours to clean up all the blood.  His family is still worried about him and want him to go into assisted living. He is adamant that he wants to stay in his house and die in it!  What I am wondering about is if Alexa could be put in his bedroom near the bath, and if it heard a loud noise could trigger a call to me and I would get up and go over there.  Is something like this possible?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks for any advice"
"Me and my dad both got amazon echoes for christmas but both are connected to different amazon accounts. Is there anyway we can make them both communicate although they are under seperate amazon accounts. For example : how would I be able to say to my alexa to tell my dads alexa to make me a cup of tea. I know you can intercom if they are on the same account but would , and if I could how , would I be able to communicate if they are on two separate accounts."
I just got an echo dot 3rd gen and every time I ask it to play a specific songs for example Fix you by Coldplay it replies “Here’s something based on Fix you by Coldplay” playing a song which is similar but not the exact song. I have prime music set as the default player and nothing on the app seems to help. Any suggestions?
"After a buying multiple units, the performance we’re getting from our Echo units is deteriorating to an unusable level.  The frustration is getting to the point that my wife wants to trash the whole system.  The music is the biggest issue - random volume changes and HUGE delays between giving a command and when music or volume changes occur.  (I mean minutes go by before the music starts.)  Alexa’s on the naughty list and she better be careful or she really *will* have to work on her resume."
"I've recently invested in a couple of Echo Shows as well as smart plugs and switches for my home.   Alexa is pretty good at turning lights on and off, but overall I'm disappointed with the lack of functionality.   Here are some (seemingly simple) things that do not work/aren't supported yet.     1. Sports update does not provide updates on all active teams - you can define sports teams in Alexa app settings that you care about and ask Alexa for a sports update, but it does not give you updates for all teams.  In my experience, only the NFL team update is provided 2. Cannot add sports update to flash briefing 3. Cannot add sports update to routine 4. Cannot customize what stocks symbols you care about 5. Cannot add stock update to routine 6. Cannot add stock update to flash briefing  7. Cannot add reminder update to routine 8. Cannot add reminder update to flash briefing 9. Cannot add calendar to flash briefing 10. Cannot add custom commands in a routine - basically, I wish I could add a step to a routine that matches what I would verbally instruct Alexa to do.   That would give you flexibility to do just about anything.  Basically, I am looking to define my flash briefing (or a routine) to give me a customized update of sports, weather, stocks, reminders, and calendar updates.    Anyone aware of workarounds to any of these?"
"Hello there,  is it possible to ignore Alexa Routines?  Example: I have a routine which shut my wifi router every day at 12 o‘clock down.   If i am watching Netflix at 11:59 i don‘t want to refuse the Internet connection.  When i say it to Alexa:“Ignore my Routine for today“ she doesn‘t know what I mean. Is there a other way i can handle it?   Thx, Mark"
Hey! I just got my new echo dot 3rd generation and I'm having this recurring issue.

"Hello,  I've bought an Echo Dot and an Onkyo P3 (Alexa integrated, very good sound).  I now want to play music with voice command on the Onkyo Speaker, but it says ""can't play music from spotify"". When the echo dot is asked to play music from Spotify, it does it without problems. I already subscribed to Spotify premium.  Is there a difference between the Echo Alexa and Alexa voice service?"
"And proud to say that I have an Alexa now! (I have the echo dot).   anyway, what I was thinking was, do you think there's any chance of maybe altering the program a little and make the Alexa bot become a bit more helpful. With things like locations, contacts etc. Is there any way to maybe make it more 'bot' like?"
"Just a heads up, all my Echos are Unresponsive or behaving weirdly today - I suspect its down to lots of new devices being registered and played with post Christmas"
"I want to know if you can make 911 calls via Alexa by saying ""Alexa, call 911."" I keep researching and on Google there's 500 different answers to one question I want to ask. And that is CAN Alexa make a call to 911 if you create a contact in your cell phone and literally name it ""911."" I just bought an Echo or whatever the one is that is $25. I am getting this for my grandmother and the only reason I got it for her is because now that she's a widow, she lives all by herself and is 83 years old. I want for her to be able to in the event of an emergency, like if she were to fall and couldn't get up or if she had severe chest pain and couldn't get to a phone she could just yell ""ALEXA, CALL 911!!!"" and it would connect her to the police. I keep reading these articles where it's a bunch of BS about how you can only call 911 if you're connected to a landline, and then there's a bunch of other websites that are trying to sell me some crappy service for a subscription of $10 a month and that seems stupid... And then there's people saying I CAN use this as long as I create a contact in my phone and literally name it 911. Does anyone have experience with trying this before. Please let me know!!"
"does the echo dot always have the option to read text messages out loud from your phone? or can you turn that option off? i don’t see any use for it, and it kinda sketches me out for it to have access to my messages and personal data like that."
"Just got the Echo Show 8 for Christmas and I’m trying to connect it to NBC, but whenever it gets to the part where I click on my service provider to sign in, I click on the name of my provider and nothing happens (my provider is Altice One).

I currently have an Echo in my bedroom that is able to control my Roku in my room. i just got another echo for the living room and i’m wondering how to set up my living room fire TV to the living room echo and still have the bedroom echo hooked up to my roku in there? i hope this make sense lol
I’d like to setup a routine from the Echo in my bedroom that will set ambient noise in the Echoes in my 3 kids rooms. Is there any way that this is possible? It seems that audio based routines are limited to a single Echo device.
"I can’t remember how I originally set it up, but I previously had the Alexa in my kitchen automatically play any Spotify music on a master dot that is connected to our house ceiling speakers.  All of a sudden, it’s stopped working. And now I can only send Spotify to the master dot with the Spotify app, but as soon as I give Alexa any commands to do with music she switches it off the master dot and just plays it locally on herself in the kitchen.  What settings do I need to adjust to fix this?"
"Hi! I have been trying to find a cheaper bluetooth multicolored light bulb for my lamp. It needs to be able to connect to my echo dot and has to be bluetooth, as my university has weird wifi and can only register through a MAC address. Preferably, connects through the SmartLife app. I have been looking everywhere and have not been able to find one that is bluetooth without a speaker."
"Although it's easy to get Alexa playing Spotify, it's not MY Spotify.  There doesn't seem to be anywhere to sign in to *my own account*  Perhaps I've missed something?"
"Hi all. I have 3 Echo Imput devices and one is connected to the New iHome iAV2v2 docking station and the other two are connected via speakers throughout the aux port. I keep getting error messages from all three devices saying that there is no speaker attached to the Echo Input. I go in to the Alexa app and set the speaker to aux, even though it's already selected. Also using Echo Connect and can answer calls from my Echo Dots around the house, but not through any of the Echo Inputs. I've tried many different things and still cannot get it to work correctly. It worked fine out of the box and for a couple of weeks. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you, Merry Christmas and a happy new year."
"My uncle bought me an echo dot today. I've always wanted one, so I was super excited. Guess what, fools? The alexa app is awful. I've been trying to connect my spotify account to the app for literally 2 hours, and it hasn't worked at all. I've talked to an amazon rep, and they said that there isn't much that they can do. I'm convinced that it's because of the awful app. Does anyone know how to fix this???"
"I'm trying to figure out how to play my ""New Music Mix"" that Apple makes personally for me each Friday, but running into issues with the commands. Whenever I say ""Alexa play new music mix"" she defaults to the general new music, not the personally tailored version for me. I can even get more specific and say my name along with my previous quote but then it starts playing random songs I've added to my library. Is there a command I can say to get her to play my Apple Music radio station that is tailored personally for me or is that non existent yet?"
Is there an alexa only voice command for volume? It's a tad annoying to have to manually change it.
"   I created a routine (see below) where the first line is to set volume to 10. I have a 3rd generation dot, a 2nd generation echo, and a first generation tall echo with knob you can turn to set volume.  In my routine when I set volume to 10, the next line is to announce something across all echo's (devices), however it only sets one echo (2nd generation echo, not dot and not first generation tall echo) to the desired volume of 10, 9, etc....... The others stay where they were originally.  Any thoughts??  Not sure how to set up an everywhere sound group either for this routine if that is an option.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  Routine is basically:  Set Volume to 10  Announce ""whatever"" on All Devices  I repeat the above...  Thats it....  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  So only one echo has the volume of 10. Strange, thoughts???  Of course I can walk over to each echo and say, Alexa Volume 10.... But I would like it to work in a routine..  Thanks for any help in advance  Peter"
"I have a Fire Stick 4K, an Echo show and the app on an Android. What are the minimum steps to be able to get them working together? My attempts have failed so far and without that at the minimum I don't know if I want to keep the Echo.

Hello  I'm still new to the Alexa thing. I just setup a dot for my nephew. Im using my account. First thing he did was ask Alexa to order a diamond ring. Big surprise it ordered me a 500 dollar ring. Thank God I could cancel it. Question is. Can I prevent ordering from that specific device?  Thank you and Merry Christmas

"I don't use Amazon music, so I've set my default to Spotify. She seems to be really picky about what she can and can't play. Ideally she'd be able to play anything at all, but when I ask her ""Alexa, play Eleanor Rigby by the Beatles"" she can't find it. She had no problem finding ""Courtship of the Mermaid"" by Ninja Sex Party, though. Both albums these songs are from are in my music library, but surely she should just play any song from Spotify? Also, ""play songs by The Beatles"" worked fine."

My parents aren't very tech savvy so they won't know how to keep doing that when it gets stuck."
I’ve defined a room with an ecobee 4 with Alexa and a Sonos Playbar called ‘TV’ and have set the Sonos as the preferred speaker. When I ask Alexa to play music it plays on the ecobee unless I add ‘on TV’ at the end of the phrase. Does anyone know if it’s possible to have the ecobee play on the Sonos by default?

I already have one myself and my parents' one is linked to my account because I have prime and therefore they can use my music, etc.  Is there a way we could create a different ~profile for my parents' one?

I set it up on my amazon account because I want to be able to set an announcement back and fourth for both of our sake. However because it’s on my Alexa my contacts are imported and I’m not able to ring myself.

"Hey everyone, I'm kind of new to this whole Alexa thingy but the problem I have tonight is baffling me.   I havea fire stick 4k at home and everything works really well. My father in law found it nice and asked if it was possible for him to have something similar at home so we bought him an echo dot since his LG OLED TV is supposed to support Alexa voice control (C9 series).  Well it turns out that after many many hours wasted trying to make everyhting work out... it just doesn't... like at all. We are finally able to have both of them communicate together and it can close and open the TV but... that's it! Even changing the volume doesn't work. Opening apps doesn't work, and now even asking Alexa to play some music fails 90% of the time with Alexa telling us to instead ask to open ''video welcome screen'' or something like that (we have it set in french so the exact translation might be a bit different).  I made sure skills where authorised for both ThinQ basic and advance but yet nothing I told the Echo dot has worked. Is there something I forgot to turn on or is there something else I need to know? I'm really at a loss here. Usually I'm pretty tech-savy and I kinda expected some bugs but not frustratig hours on end with absolutly no progress else then being able to open and shut down the TV.   I tried the android mobile app, nothing ever came of it. Tried the PC app and it's then that we could get them to at least talk to one another. Can someone point me in the direction to have it at least communicate with one another. Am I expecting too much in thinking that we could use the Echo dot to at least open amazon video, is the Echo dot faulty? It seems to recognize what I ask of it fine but it just refuses to control the TV in any way."

"Bunnings, our local hardware joint, had the Alexa and Google units for sale at $36, so I bought an Alexa, came home and set it up reasonably quickly, and got my lights working with it, Spotify and our local FM stations playing from it and pretty much enjoying the experience overall.  But then I realised I needed another unit for my bedroom, so living alone (OK I have a cat and a dog) I didn't need Alexa's intercom option, so went for the Google Home Mini.  I found it much harder to set up, and at times was left scratching my head on where to add new devices. On the Alexa app it was all right in front of me, but I had to hunt for the option with Google.  I still feel that the options on the Google unit were somewhat limited too.  When I was trying to decide which unit to buy, I was very fifty fifty, but what tipped the scales for me was that I felt that saying ""Alexa"" was going to be easier to say, ""OK Google"" makes me feel like I've got a mouthful of marbles, I plan to try changing it to ""Computer"" soon. (or Alexa).  If you're thinking of buying one of these units and you consider yourself less tech savvy than other people appear to be, I'd quite honestly choose the Alexa over Google."
"I received an Echo Show 8 as a gift, and thought I would be able to use it in the kitchen for music and recipes. I have other Dots in the house, but figured the screen would be helpful. I quickly find out I can't play music and have firefox open at the same time. I also can't leave a recipe up for more than a few minutes before it goes back to the home screen. I can't turn the ""try this"" suggestions off.  Basically, I'm finding the show a little more annoying than helpful.  Am I missing something with the show? Does anyone know if the google nest hub is any better for these issues?"

Title!  Got an Echo Dot for Christmas and I can't find any info on whether you can listen to music directly on it. I know that's something you can do with the Google Home Mini so I'd like to know if I could do it on the Dot too. Haven't opened it yet so I'm not sure.  Thanks!
"So we used to play this game where Alexa/the game would give us clues and we had to figure out what the word was.  It had different categories... Super heroes, pop figures, traffic, food (I think).   The problem is the skill is missing. It was one of the better skills (we thought), and we actually paid to unlock more categories.   Does anyone remember or know this game? Maybe how to find it?  I've checked our list alphabetically and by usage. I've even checked payment history. I just can't find it. Where do I go from here?"

Any thoughts?
"Bought my parents each a echo show for Christmas so they can video chat with my daughter. I googled and read some articles on calling. What I don’t understand is how does Alexa know to call their echo? Like if I said call dad, how does it know he has one? Will it automatically call his show over his cellphone? I feel like this is way simpler than I’m thinking but can’t see to find an answer."
"Hello  [Today my parents bought Amazon Echo only for me to find out that the wifi button doesn't work.](https://preview.redd.it/9ywx4z986m641.png?width=151&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5381b1ec111759772a94b79da46b9fe21cba061f)  I tried resetting both the phone and the echo device but that didn't work either.

"I was wondering if it's possible to use an Echo Dot to listen to the room it's in remotely. When we go on a trip, I set up a camera so that I can have check up on my cat, monitor the cat sitter's comings and goings (they know), and general security concerns. However, it has no audio. So I wondered if it was possible to just monitor the room using Alexa in my Echo Dot. Even better, is it possible to talk to someone on the other end remotely?"
"Backstory for explanation.  I was living with my old partner, she played for amazon prime, I paid for Netflix  We separated on good terms so agreed to keep up the arrangement.  Both living separately now but sharing accounts but with our own amazon/google logins.  We both now have echo dots around the houses. I got mine first and it works perfectly, music plays, lights work, shopping list etc all correct.  My ex has set hers up, but now whenever she buys something on amazon, I get a notification in my house of its imminent delivery. Also more annoyingly, if she tells alexa to play music, it links up to my spotify account and plays from that. However if she opens her spotify she can tell it to play on her speakers, but voice commands to the dots make it hook up to mine.  Is there any way we can get rid of these cross-overs?  Worst case I'll leave her amazon and buy my own but it seems strange when every other part of our accounts are separate (ie if I buy on amazon it knows it's me and where to send it)"
"Hello. My power button on the fire tv turn on the TV and the receiver. I would like Alexa to ""press"" this button, but when I say ""turn on fire TV/TV/or else"" she always answer ""can't find the device"".

So this is my first dot and I’ve noticed about 3/4 of the way through a song it fades out and either stops if it’s playing a specific song or switches to a new song if it’s a station (amazon music).

"I wanted to leave this here in case another Alexa noobie encounters the same problem (sorry if this is obvious to you, it took me 20 minutes to figure out since this is my first Echo dot and I am not tech savvy):  All the top search results said I have to change the wake word in the Alexa app. But when I went into my device page on the app, the wake word field said ""Loading..."" forever until the operation timed out and took me back to the previous page. Clicking the wake word field took me to a blank page and I had to close the app and start over. I also couldn't find where to change it on alexa.amazon.com. But then I figured out that you can just ask Alexa to change the wake word directly. You don't even need the app at all. Just say, ""Alexa, I want to change your wake word."" And she will respond with the three alternate options you are allowed to pick from (Echo, Amazon, Computer). You tell her which one you want and then you're done :) I hope this helps someone else save some time!"
"Howdy! I am looking at getting an alexa auto. I have a few questions before I purchase it though!  &amp;#x200B;  I drive a 2009 Honda Civic, with an aux port and a cig lighter. If I use alexa, is there any way for me to charge my phone as well?  I also have concerns that if I use alexa in my car it will be like my old \*super\* cheap bluetooth adapter that plugged into my aux cord. It required me to turn it on every time I got into the car and would stay on when I leave (keeping my phone on bluetooth to my turned off car) for a while unless I turned it off. Does the Alexa Auto turn on and off bluetooth automatically when my car turns on? Does it sync up to my phone's audio immediately and turn off when my car turns off?  Does it work well with Iphones? Are there any features that don't seem to work properly with IOS?  Thanks a ton!"
YesterdayI asked Alexa at a friend’s house to“open my gift”. And she played a Hanukkah song. I’m trying to figure out what that Hanukkah song was. Was it the same for everyone? Is there a way to track down response history?

"Hello,  I'm trying to get Alexa to control my dad's Roku (Express?) I didn't have any trouble getting it added to his app, and the Echo tries fine but every time we issue even a basic command, it comes back with some generic message that was unable to get it. I've tried renaming the device in the Alexa app to just be ""Roku"" but that didn't help any.  I'm aware NetFlix just won't work. We've been trying with YouTube TV and Plex. Any ideas/suggestions?  The support page for the skill on Roku's site seemed to be saying that the device is supported so I don't think it's that, but I'm not 100% positive.  Everyhting is up to date on software versions.  Thanks!"
"I got a box of Saudio smart LED light bulbs for my birthday but saw you have to connect them to a weird app called ""Smart Life"". I tried working with Smart Life once with some smart plugs and it was a total failure. So I refuse to even try again. I will only use devices that are recognized by Alexa directly with no need for a 3rd party to stick their nose in my business of turning on and off lights.  With that said, is their any smart LED light bulbs that connect directly to Alexa with no lame 3rd party interference?"
Recently got a echo dot... when I run my dishwasher Alexa goes glitchy then stops working.  Any thoughts?
"Hey! I just linked my Spotify(premium) to Alexa, but I can't figure how I can make Alexa play specific song from specific artist on routines. Is it even possible? I can make it play specific song from random artist or random song from specific artist yes but.. 🤔"

"Hey all. Recently switched over from the Google Home ecosystem to Amazon Alexa, about 3 months ago. Overall I think it was the right decision, except for when it comes to controlling the Fire TV stick. One of the main reasons I use the the Alexa, aside from controlling smart lights, is to control my entertainment. I find that the Alexa doesn’t control the Fire TV well at all. Looking for some guidance/help.  Let me start by saying that yes, my Fire TV is linked with my Echo, and I can do things like launch Netflix, for example. But that’s about the extent. When it comes to actually controlling playback, my echo seems to be very dumb. A simple command such as “echo play” (echo is my wake word) or “echo resume” or “echo fast forward 30 seconds” gets me a response that constantly tells me “sorry, that device is not supported” or “______ is not available”. This is true for just about all apps, Netflix, HBO GO, Prime, etc. Once in a while, echo actually completes the command....I’m talking 1 in 20 times maybe. What am I doing wrong?  Looking for any advice or guidance to help this newb. Appreciate all responses in advance."
 I recently bought an echo dot and have been putting in voice activated smart devices such as smart bulbs and i put a smart plug for my tv. I am debating whether or not to buy one for my nintendo switchs dock but im scared that it’ll brick my system. Is it safe to use? I tried looking it up but found nothing

"I pay for Amazon music for one device.  Does this mean one device at a time, or one device period?  I have an Echo and Echo dot in different rooms.  Right now only the Echo can access Amazon music, the Dot cannot.  Is there a way to get Amazon music on my Dot when I'm not using the Echo?"
"If you open the Alexa app, go to devices, your echo dot, and sounds, there's an option to toggle on/off ""selected sound detection"" listed under ""guard"". This is not in the guard settings, just in the sound settings, and there's no explanation for it.   I have my guard mode set to listen for CO alarms, smoke alarms, and glass breaking. Toggling ""selected sound detection"" on/off does not change anything in my guard settings, so I'm curious what it does.   My guess is that in a future update it'll be a way to train the echo dot to listen for specific sounds that you select. Dogs barking, the washer or dryer finishing, oven timer, doors opening, speech, footsteps, you name it.   Anyone know for sure what it's for?"
"Is there a history function for the Amazon plug? every so often, I'm finding one of my plugs will turn off, but I cannot figure out what is causing it to happen. I know how to review my voice history in the Alexa app, but I cannot figure out if there is a history for specific devices."
"So I’ve got an echo dot 3. During drop in calls the other person says they can not hear me all that well. It’s very quiet. I am right next to my dot, not even 2 feet away.   This seems like a bad echo to me, what do you guys think?"
I can get stations to play in multiple rooms but I can’t figure out how to get the Bluetooth to play in different rooms through Apple Music. Any ideas?
Can I build a location based routine based on my phones location AND my wife’s phones?   For example when both of our phones are outside of the home location turn on guard and set heat to X.
To make a very long story short i need to rename a third gen eco dot but on the drop in list thing. I have reset all of the devices on the network but they are all still showing up as they were before. I need to change one of the names on that drop it bit i have also renamed all the devices in the device setting can anyone help.
"It would be like an echo glow, but smaller, and would screw into a lightbulb socket.  Like any other echo, it would have a mic and speaker and hearing your commands and giving output, and it would also function as a lightbulb.  This would be particularly ideal for showers, as many bathrooms are partitioned into a sink room (with outlets), and then an entire other room with the shower, bath, and toilet where there are no outlets. As such, they would need to make it well protected against steam from hot showers."
I'm not sure if this only applies to Gen 1 bulbs maybe Gen 2 also but if it can't find your bulbs you need to download Lamp Finder backup tool off philips site. What is weird to me is I think they either updated something on Philips Hues server side or Amazon Echo software and the Echo Plus no longer can find the bulbs either.   If you have an Amazon Echo Plus and can't find your Hue bulbs you can either buy newer Hue bulbs or a newer Hue hub and run this [https://huetips.com/lamp-finder/](https://huetips.com/lamp-finder/) and this is also what you need to do to find older bulbs with newer hubs.  Kinda stupid they updated the server or software to not find bulbs / be backwards compatible in the finding part but that's the solution every other solution didn't work for me.  HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE
"We've got a family in-joke which is the question ""Is the sun over the yard arm?"" which means ""Is it time to have a drink yet?"". And the correct response is of course yes.  I wanted to program Alexa to say yes whenever this question is asked using a routine. However annoyingly she always completely ignores the routine and explains the origin of the phrase instead (it's a nautical thing). Is there a way around this?"
"I know you can turn on Shuffle mode AFTER music is already playing. But can you switch to a speaker group AFTER music has started playing.  What sometimes happens is the music only starts on the Echo that Im facing.. and not on the speaker group I asked for.  So is there a way to say ""Play music on UPSTAIRS group"" midstream?    When I do that now.. it starts different music. Not continues the music already playing.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks"

"Hey, for last year or so one of my Alexa's will repeat the same phrase (""Beep beep I'm a silly"" either bit or bot is last word) every single day at 3pm.    At first I thought it was my wife messing, but it's constant without fail every single day at 3pm, even if she's sitting right beside me.   None of our other Alexa's do this. I've checked routines, I've checked reminder, and everything else I can think off.    She has been rebooted several times and still does this everyday at 3pm. Has anyone else experienced this, or similar?"

"Having a problem with Spotify and my Echo Dot.  When the Home Theatre is set up between my Fire Stick and my Echo Dot I can not use voice commands to play music from Spotify. So for example I will say ""Alexa play Metallica on Spotify"", she will respond with ""Playing songs by Metallica from Spotify"" but no music will play. As soon as I delete the Home Theatre group in my Alexa App she will play music without issue through voice commands.  The second problem is through the Spotify app on my phone. My Echo Dot no longer appears instead it has been replaced with 'Home Theatre' and when I select this to listen to music through my dot it turns on the TV and brings up artist info on the TV.  I do not want my TV to turn on when I stream music from Spotify on my phone, and I want to be able to select my echo dot in my Spotify app. Also I want to be able to use voice commands to use Spotify on my echo dot while also having my home theatre set up for watching television.  Surely this is possible?? What am I missing here?"

"Hey All -  Weird question... got a call from our relatives who are new to the Alexa world who said they came home today to an image of a demon on their Show 5. When they asked Alexa what it was, she responded with something along the lines of ""I can't tell you"".  They've got some little kids so it apparently freaked them out a bit but I'm not sure what it could have been.  They run photos through the slideshow so my first thought was just that they accidentally uploaded a creepy photo but they said it was not a part of the slideshow feature.  My next thought was that it may have been a screen about winter solstice but then Alexa would be able to give more info.  Another thought was that there's a creepy skill that was enabled (accidentally or a joke) but I can't seem to find anything along those lines in the app.  Anyone see anything similar? I've got the original Echo Show and I was around it most of the day and I didn't see anything like they were describing.  Any thoughts or guesses as to what it was?"

I have a light plugged into a Kasa plug, and I want to be able to ask Alexa to turn it on and off with out telling me okay or chiming. I just spent a half hour on a phone call with Alexa help for them to tell me the only two options are chime or “okay”. The guy I spoke with did not even seem familiar with the Alexa app though and kept putting me on hold to figure out the app from his end, so I am not convinced he really knew what he was talking about."

For example, Alexa might say something like ""Nice to meet you"", but in a Korean accent. After which the player should respond with that same phrase. By default, the player has five minutes to correctly guess as many phrases as they can, with each correct answer earning the player a point. If they need help, the player can ask Alexa for a hint, or just give up on the phrase if it's too hard. We only have movie quotes in our database right now, but we plan to expand it soon.

Can I name my Alexa to marriah karrey?
"Anybody experience their routines half working occasionally? Like for example, one of my routines is I say “Alexa I’m going to bed”. She is supposed to shut all the smart plugs and lights off, turns the bedroom light on, and then turns the bedroom light off 3 minutes later. Sometimes she works fine. Sometimes she doesn’t shut the lights/things off. Sometimes she turns the bedroom light on but not off. Sometimes she gives me the silent treatment, doesn’t even respond to the routine prompt.  There is no rhyme or reason to how or when the routine “breaks”. No hubs involved or anything, everything connects directly to Alexa so it’s not like something is offline. And it’s not just this routine, my other two do it as well. What gives?!"
"I have both and the Echo 2 can hear me and respond from down the other end of the house.

"Just got my Fire TV Stick 4K and am having issues with a couple of things.   Just going to preface this by saying I searched everywhere online, YouTube and settings before coming here.   Firstly, my remote, which is the latest gen, has two problems:  1) The home button ONLY works when held down which pops up the shortcut menu (which doesn’t include a “go home” option). When I single-click it does not go home. How do I get the home button to go home?  2) Voice control doesn’t work. Either by single pressing or holding while talking the voice commands don’t work. I get no acknowledgement from the device other than that when I release the button, the blue light flashes rapidly. How do I get voice to work?  Now with how my echo dot is having issues:  3) My echo dot is now paired with my fire TV. However it can only switch to apps like Netflix and such. It will not switch inputs (despite me having already set this up through the settings menu where it appeared to work properly during the testing.) Also, it will turn my TV off on command but not on.   Thanks in advance"
"Hi everyone,  I was listening to music in the kitchen through Alexa and my mother said “thank you very much for cooking.” No Alexa prompt.   At this point, the music cut out and a male voice said “you’re very very welcome.” I have not heard this voice before and have the settings on the female voice. The voice sounded a bit robotic but it’s hard to tell since it happened so fast and I immediately unplugged it.   What’s up with that? I’m a little terrified, truthfully."
"So I don't have to say ""on Spotify"". But I can still use other services if I say ""on [service]"". On an Echo Show specifically.  Thanks"

"Why has Alexa recently been trying to engage me in conversation?   When I say 'Alexa time', all I want is the time.

Does Amazon support 3rd party Alexa-enables smart speakers to be added to smart home device groups?  Scenario: I’ve installed several Onelink Safe &amp; Sound smoke/co2 detectors with Alexa built in.  They’re in rooms with Lutron caseta-controlled lights.  I’d like to add the Onelink devices to the room groups as Alexa devices so when I’m in the kitchen I can say ‘Alexa turn on the lights’ instead of ‘Alexa turn on the kitchen lights’ but the Onelink smart speakers don’t show up.

"One of the rooms in my home has an overhead light and 2 lamps. All have smart bulbs. I have smart home groups set up with those devices as the lamps. When I tell Alexa to ""Turn on the light"", what I want to happen is it turns on the overhead light but instead it turns on all of the bulbs in that room. I don't want to have to say the name of the light itself (in this case ""Master Bedroom light"") as that is less convenient and sometimes hard to remember. If I create a routine for ""Turn on the light"" with the overhead light, it no longer allows me to say ""Turn on the light"" to another echo in another room to turn on the light in that other room. It turns on the light in the first room.  I have noticed that some routines get the option to pick which device you want to talk to when you want a routine to fire but smart home routines don't have this.   Any options or hacks to get this to work? Why is the From option so selective?"
"Here's the scenario. My niece has an echo speaker (3rd generation) in her bedroom but I thought of getting her an echo show 5 as an alarm clock/music controller.

For example, if she plays Taylor Swift music it would show ""what's playing"" on her echo show but with the sound coming out of her echo speaker or preferably both devices. I've searched through google and found you can pair identical devices (for stereo sound) but no clear answer on related Amazon devices."

"YO, so I have a really stupid idea in the works to hook up my Alexa to a wireless monitor so I can have Alexa's voice alone show up on some mounted monitor on my wall with an equilizer.  Then I'd be able to say ""Computer, blah blah blah""  And Alexa would do it ofc but whatever it says would show up on the equalizer. I just think that would be pretty neat.  I dont have the Alexa just yet which is why Im asking here instead of just figuring it out on my own, but I googled if you could hook up Alexa up to your computer and as far as I know you can, so I was just wondering if there was anything you professionals know that would be anything stopping me from doing this.  Bonus question, Ive seen people like Michael Reeves on youtube code for Alexa. I've dug through google for a bit and cant find anything on how you would even begin coding for Alexa. Or am I mistaken and this is not possible? Thank you."

"So, I just got my echo dot about 3 days ago. I linked it to Pandora and Spotify. For the first day it worked perfectly.   All of a sudden, when I give Alexa any sort of command for Spotify, it responds back saying “Playing ___ from Spotify” and does nothing.   Ive tried linking and unlinking the account many many times. Nothing seems to be fixing the issue.   Has anyone else heard of this issue?"
"Hi all! I recently got some echos for the apartment and wanted to make a routine for when my partner comes home. The goal is for them to say ""Alexa, I'm home"", then some other stuff happens, then the problem arises. Is there any way to have Alexa provide a custom prompt, e.g. ""How was your day?"" and then I can program each response to open a different playlist?  I'm basically trying to have Alexa start the music via a prompt rather than have my partner ask Alexa to play music. It looks like it'll have to be a skill, is that possible even for a skill?"
"I bought one of the first mobile Alexa's last summer, but never got around to finishing the install.  It is asking for a password to connect to a Bluetooth on my phone,  Huh?  So what password would I use?  Since I tossed the packages am I screwed?"
So I connected a Bluetooth speaker (memorex unpopular brand)to my Alexa echo dot 3rd generation. It transfer the volume from Alexa to the speaker instead of Alexa working in the in built speaker and me asking Alexa to play music on the speaker. I would like both speakers working at the same time but it won’t let me set this up. When I go into multi room music it does not show the Bluetooth device. Someone please help.
"OK so I'm about to get an echo dot I believe, I know I'm going to do some alexa controlled lights in my music studio /tabletop gaming room for atmosphere and such. Smart bulbs and or switches in the living room, kitchen and probably bedroom and more. My question is this. If I was to get the echo right now what are some MUST HAVE items I may not think about? Or some links to affordable bang for my buck items listed already. I'm disabled and that is part of why I'm doing this so affordable is a must. That said I will do a once in a while bigger purchase IF it will either greatly improve functionality or expand it and/or help just improve my life in general. Thanks so much!"
"I don't see a way to ask Alexa to turn off the screen on the Show 5. I find that even at its dimmest setting that the screen is too bright for bed. I ask her to turn it off every night. I'd like a way to add this to a ""goodnight"" routine so that way it happens at the end of the nightly routine."
"I've set up some lights on the network so I can get Alexa to turn them off/on when I ask her to but after every time she says ""okay."" Is it possible (I've looked and not seen anything) to get Alexa to not say anything when she does it? Only other option I saw was a notification sound. I don't want either. Is it possible? Thanks."
"We’ve had echo dots for years now, with moderate success connecting to devices (all the bulbs in the home, harmony bridge, ring doorbell, etc.). Recently got a Fire Stick 4K and when I try to view my Ring doorbell, the echo dot says I need to link the devices via the Alexa app.  So the official amazon Alexa YouTube shows how to do this, as does their website. However, the instructions are out dated. The menu doesn’t give the options suggest, and numerous outlets have pointed out the app has been updated and the instructions are no longer helpful.  Now I turn to you, other Amazon users. You’re my only hope. How do I link these devices now?"

"I have an outdoor smart plug that I want to connect to some Christmas lights. I may be going away for a few days, but I want those lights (and other lights) to turn on an off on a schedule while I'm not at home. If you set up a routine and select 'schedule,' it seems that you can do this, but it MAKES me select a location before I can set it. How do I remove this location requirement, because I want it to do this regardless of where I am? It seems like a pretty basic thing to want to do, so am I missing something?"
"RE: spotify. If i ask her for any song, she tells me name of song then -   &gt; From active user first name &lt;   WTH ? She never ever done that before...

"I have echo at home and I want to put an echo in my office at work. If these are both connected to my amazon account, I am assuming the echo at work would be able to issue commands to my home? Is that true? If so, how do I prevent that? I would not want random people in my office to issue commands to my home through my echo."
"Looking for ideas. We have multiple Echo products in our home - several 1st gen dots, a first gen echo, echo plus, and echo show (1st gen).  We got a 3rd Gen dot for the kid’s room, hoping for a bit better sound quality.  The first one would not connect. Thinking it was a hardware problem, Amazon replaced it. I’m trying to install the new one today. The problem persists. We’ve exhausted the guides on Amazon’s site.   The 3rd gen dot sees all the networks in range, including ours. Password is correct. It’s literally sitting directly under the access point. Yet it sees every network as just one bar and refuses to connect. It shows up on either of our phones, but it simply will not connect to the network, not the 2.4 or the 5 ghz.  Any ideas? The rest of the Echo swarm are all connected fine."
"I have a sleep disorder that makes it VERY difficult to wake up to stimuli. Once I find something that wakes me up, my body gets used to it and a few days later I'm back to square one. Alexa has been a game-changer as far as being able to automate my lights to help wake me up, turn on the radio, et cetera, but is there a way to randomize what she turns on so that I don't know what's coming? If anyone has any other ideas, I'm open to hearing them."
I need a simple device to listen to what I say and send that to my alexa (in another room) and also play music from that speaker.   Would I be better off using a raspberry pi or arduino or something or is there a cheap enough product that does this?
"Particularly I get a bit enraged (I blame hormones) when I ask what the weather is, I’m told it’s 29 degrees outside and then she tells me to enjoy the sunshine.   I don’t mind the “have a nice day” as much but her weather related niceties are wrong more often than they are right."
"I have my Galaxy S10 paired to my Echo when I'm at home. Recently when I get a notification, Alexa prefaces the notiication sound with: ""Playing from phone."" She didn't always do this and it's annoying.  Does anyone know why she is doing this lately?  TIA"
"Lost in Translation is a speech based game in which Alexa says a phrase in an accent and the player has to guess what Alexa said.

"Hi,   I have multiple Alexa devices hooked up throughout my house using my main Alexa/Amazon account. These devices can all control my SmartHome devices (switches, plugs, lights, etc) using skills that I’ve configured. (Kasa, ecobee, meross, etc)  My question is this: We’re getting each of our kids their very own Echo Show 5 for their bedrooms. We want each child to be able to control their own Echo’s (music, alarms, calendars, skills, Skype, etc) while still being able to control all the various SmartHome devices my main Alexa/Amazon account can already control using routines or scenes.  How would I accomplish this? Can this be accomplished? Please keep in mind that I’m in Canada and Amazon Households isn’t available to us! 🙄 (hopefully it will be in the near future)  I know there’s voice profiles here in Canada.. I’m just not sure if it’ll work the way I’d like it too as I described.   Thanks for any help you may be able to provide!"

"I bought my girlfriend a normal echo dot but decided I wanted to get her the echo show 5 instead. I lost the receipt and couldn't return the dot so I have no use for it since I already have one. Her room has a normal bedroom area and then a sort of loft/attic area. I was wondering if there are ways to sync them somehow so she has the show for her alarm clock sort of thing by her bed and the dot downstairs. if so, how is this useful. The only thing I could come up with was for listening to music when shes downstairs since if the show is upstairs turning music to a volume where she could hear it downstairs might just be annoying for her family to hear. thanks in advance"

"Is anyone else having problems playing NPR New Now?  It was working fine from Apple Podcasts until a few days ago.

"I have an iPad and an iPhone, both with the same Apple ID. No matter what I name them or how I pair them with Alexa, she considers both of them “my iPhone” for the voice command to connect them.   So for example, right now, both my phone and my iPad are listed as paired devices on the Alexa app. So if I go to Bluetooth on my iPad and connect to my echo dot, it pairs and works great. Same for my phone. But if I say, “Alexa, connect to my iPad” she goes “connecting to iPhone” and connects to my phone instead. Even if I name my iPad (and reset the connection) something weird and distinguishable, when I ask to connect to that name, it will work but then save it in her voice command memory as “my iPhone” even if I’ve named it ‘blueberry gumdrop”. So the next time I try to connect, it only connects to my phone.   Is there any way around this issue?"
"I need a way to note when I take medications and when, if any , side effects occur . I tried the third party note taking apps.. saving to One Note, and each entry having its own separate page is brutal. Wading through 40 pages with one line each is not going to work.  I tried adding a list, and adding items, but Alexa does not save time stamps.  So I want to say:  Alexa, add to notes:  took xyz meds.  Alexa, add to notes:  nausea.  I should expect to see all on one page : 12/19/2019 1:39 pm took xyz meds 12/19/2019 1:56 pm nausea  It seems easy enough - am I missing a setting or an app?   If nothing is available, I guess I will just add the date and time verbally to my note-   Alexa, add to notes:  Dec 19, 1:39 PM took xyz meds      But the whole point is to make it so simple, I actually use it.   I figured there was already something out there.  Thanks if anyone can help."

My grandmother leaves her car running sometimes and I would like Alexa to set a reminder for her to make sure it is off. I can do that But I haven't figured out how to do it in a way that requires her to confirm that she's turned the car off before it stops reminding her.

"Hello, I am planning to buy an echo dot 3 (white) for beginning to connect my house.

"I posted this over on the Comcast forum, but thought I might post it here because I am not sure who is following standards and who isn't.  TLDR - Echo Connect doesn't hear a ring from Comcast phone line.  I have 2 phone lines at my house, our primary house line comes from Comcast via their voice modem (CGM4140COM) and a second line, not often used, that is from Ooma. For both lines, calls ring and Caller ID comes through on our handsets in the house.  I bought an Echo Connect so we will get caller ID and be able to answer/make calls hands free from throughout the house on our main line. However, when I hook up the Echo Connect to the Comcast voice modem, it does not sense when the phone rings. I am able to make outbound calls, but an inbound calls comes in, I do not get caller ID, and if I ask Alexa to answer the phone, she says ""There is no incoming call."" After getting a replacement because tech support thought it was the device, I still had the same issue. On a whim, I connected it to the Ooma line and both incoming and outgoing calls work.   Since all my phones ring/get caller ID, it would make sense that it is the Echo Connect that is at fault in not picking up the ring. However, the Ooma generates a ring that that the Echo Connect picks up, so maybe the Voice modem isn't putting out the right ring for the Connect to pick up.  Anyone have any ideas (or the same setup to test)?  Dan"

"I have a routine on my Echo Dot to wake me up in the morning. It goes like this:  1. Turn on bedroom lights 2. Say a ""good morning"" phrase 3. Tell me the weather 4. Play the news from my Flash Briefing  I bought the Samuel L. Jackson voice yesterday, intending to have him read me the weather and news with my morning alarm routine. However, *after* I purchased it, I learned that in order to have him read me the weather, for example, I can't just say ""what's the weather?"" I have to say something along the lines of ""Ask Sam to read me the weather.""  I've gone into my routines on the Alexa app to try to find somewhere to type in a voice command as an action, but if that's a possibility, I can't find it. In my routines options I have the option to have Alexa read me the weather, for example, but I can't create a specific command to have Sam read it.  So basically I'm looking to have my alarm routine do this:  1. Turn on bedroom lights 2. Say a ""good morning"" phrase 3. Have the Alexa act as if I've said ""Ask Sam to read me the weather"" (so that he reads me the weather) 4. Have the Alexa act as if I've said ""Ask Sam to tell me the news"" (so that he reads me the news)  I've read that I can use Tasker and Autovoice with IFTTT to make this happen.

I got the Show 5 on Black Friday for $50 thinking I could get rid of the stereo (the Show 5 audio is definitely sufficient for podcasts, which is mostly what I listen to in bed).   But now, especially when I’m playing a podcast, if I try to issue a command (say, “Turn on bedroom lights”) half the time it doesn’t hear me and I end up screaming at the Show 5.   Is this problem typical for the Show 5 or should I return and replace it?"
"I'm trying to do simple things like turn it off and on and change the volume. When I say ""Alexa turn off Fire TV"" it says can't find it. When I press ""ALL OFF"" for the group the Fire TV is in in the Alexa app, nothing happens. Both the Echo Show and Fire TV show up as Online in the Alexa app."
"My wife and mother-in-law LOVE cooking.  When my wife showed my mother-in-law her new Show 5, she seemed to love it until she noticed you could ask for recipes.  She then stated that she should always ask her first while she is still here.  Instant. Waterworks.  This leads me to my question, is there a way I can record her voice for a recipe so when my wife asks how to make Mama’s Biscuits and Gravy, it will respond with her mother’s recording.  Or if that’s not possible, what if I had a recipe in her handwriting and wanted to upload that somehow?  Thanks to all of you tech-savvy people and happy holidays!"
I just got my Alexa today and whenever I ask it to play something on Spotify it just plays a random song I asked it to play way down we go by kaleo and it said it would then just started playing wild theme by some guy called mark knopffer and when I go into the Alexa app it tells me my recently played is way down we go any help is appreciated
"I’m completely confused and unable to set up my family as Alexa users.  I have two tech-savvy kids aged 10 and 14, and they should be able to access our Alexa home from the app and through voice recognition.  I tried setting them up as household members, but ended up having just one of them listed as adult with no option to add another.  Then I tried enabling FreeTime, but it apparently isn’t available in my country.  I don’t need to put any restrictions on their access at all. I want them to be able to use it the way they use the Google Home app - via the app as well as voice recognition.  They are not going to break anything, and I don’t mind them listening to Green Day, basically. I don’t need to restrict time spent either.  How can I do this?"
"I tried to play CHVRCHES but because of the ""V"" it just played a random ""churches"" song. When I say ""poppy"" it plays ""Poppy Akroyd"" or smth, why would it deliberately play the longer name. When you have an artist called ""Weekend"" and Weeknd"" just forget it and pray for the fifty fifty chance that alexa gets it right.   The problem in this is that alexa is too basic as you can't have a dialogue with it to clarify your request. You just say ""play X"" and hope for the best.   I jus wish they would start doing a more complex alexa because else I don't see a big future for that outside of turning things on or off."
"So, overall it’s what the title says, but the details: I just bought an Echo Dot on Black Friday and it finally just arrived. I currently live in an university residence and so I don’t have my personal network, instead there is one to which I connect that has a captive website through which I log in. I tried setting up the dot using it but the pop up with the browser just showed up for a fraction of a second before disappearing. I searched the net and apparently at least one person has had this problem before, but no answer apart from “you should get your own private network”, which, for me, just isn’t a possibility. So I did the setup using my phone as a hotspot, and it worked quite well. It continued to work quite well until I had to leave, and thus it disconnected. When I came back is when I started having some *really* irritating problems. The dot would connect to my hotspot (it would show on my iPhone that there was a device connected that had to be the dot, as the time *always* matched perfectly for connecting and disconnecting, but the dot keep on acting as though it was trying to connect, for ever. Then, when I went inti setup mode to try and force a connection it would do the same, connect but not recognize it, and then it would pop out of setup mode for no reason, which would cause it to lose the connection it had established (even though it didn’t recognize it). Finally, in the few times it actually managed to connect it would disconnect a few moments later, so I couldn’t manage to do anything with it other than ask one question or two to certify that it actually connected.  Has anyone else faced this? Is there a fix? For me the ideal would be a fix to the problem with the university internet, so that I don’t eat up my data or depend on having my phone nearby and charged. But even if I can just connect to the hotspot reliably it would be great, as I just want to truly finish setting it up and checking out what it can do and what not.  Anyways, thanks for any help in regards to this, it has really irritated me up til now."
"Okay so I have bought the Sam L Jackson voice and when I say Introduce me to Samuel L Jackson it says: Sorry Mr. Jackson isn't available right now, and when I ask a question for him just to test it nothing happens. If anyone could help I would be grateful."
"I told the Echo in the lounge, ‘Alexa, set alarm on Bedroom’. Doesn’t work, just sets the alarm on Lounge. Normally saying ‘Alexa, play &lt;radiostation&gt; on Bedroom’ to another Echo works. Why can’t I get the alarm to do this?"
I was looking into getting an echo button so that when I press it; it’ll turn off my lights and arm my security system. I have the ismart alarm skill enabled and I have to say Alexa tell ismart alarm to ark my system. But pressing a button would be easier but it’s not an option in the routines list
"Echo auto worked the first day wonderfully and hasn't since (4 more days).  Now anytime I ask Alexa to do anything (ie ""resume audible"" or ""Play blah blah blah on Spotify"") - Alexa replies  ""your mobile device has lost connection to the internet, please try again later""...  It still connects via Bluetooth to my phone and I can stream Spotify or Audible through the device from my phone.  It did give me that ""lost connection"" error once on the first day when I was driving where I had zero bars (live in the country and don't have full reception on all roads) - but   My mobile device has never connected through wifi to the internet (parking space is to far from wifi router) and Echo Auto did work the first day fine through android mobile data.  I've checked my data usage on the Verizon website and have 94% left for the month.  What could be the issue?  Phone = google pixel XL"
"New issue with my Echo Show 5. I have synced my calendar from my iPhone but the times shown on upcoming events are 6 hours behind the actual event. Example, today I have an appointment to get a haircut at 4:30pm. Shows 4:30pm on my iPhone but on the Echo Show 5 it shows as 10:30am. I tried deleting the event and then adding it again with the same result. It used to work flawlessly. Anyone else experiencing this issue?"
"Alexa makes a du duhh sound every once in awhile. Don't know what it is.  Also Sirius XM I have to sometimes unplug Alexa and plug it back in to get SXM to work. Is there a way to tell alexa to ""Reboot"" or ""Restart"" without having to physically unplug the echo dot?"
"Hi everyone, I'm considering a new Echo Show as a Christmas gift with the idea that it would be sort of a dedicated Wyze cam viewer most of the time. On my Echo Spot, the Wyze cam only stays active for about 5 minutes, maybe less, before it goes back to the clock. Is it possible to make it stay on the Wyze cam all the time instead of going back to a default screen? If not with the Wyze skill itself, could it be done with a different skill that can access RTSP?  Thanks"

"Hi! I have a question with regards to the Philips Hue light bulb. Since I don't have a Phillips Hue bridge I tried to connect the light bulb with my echo plus (2nd Gen) because I was under the impression that this should connect regardless due to the integrated zigbee hub. What I've tried so far:     **Attempt #1 (Reset with serial number)**   1. Go to ""Add Device""  2. ""Search device"" then fails to recognize the light bulb  3. Tap on ""Help""  4. Select ""Reset Phillips Hue Light"" &amp; enter the six-digit serial number  5. Go to ""Search Device"" again and switch on the light  *Result: Search was unsuccessful*      **Attempt #2 (Reset manually)**   1. Switch off the light, wait for approximately 3 seconds  2. Switch on the light, wait for another 2 seconds  3. Repeat step 1 and step 2 three more times  4. Switch off the light, go to ""Search Device"" and then switch on the light one more time   *Result: Search was unsuccessful*      I also found [this video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJQ7FUPkpHg) but I can't get this to work.

"Hi,  I live in a country where Amazon Prime is not available, and everybody pretty much uses Google. I have pretty much everything in my Google account (whatever gets on Android by default), but lately, I've been kind of anxious about ""dispersing"" my digital stuff, as Google seems to be aiming to become ""the internet"". What I was thinking was switching to Office 365+ Bing, Alexa for voice commands, Here maps for mapping, and then other internet services for other stuff.   However, I do have some questions about Alexa to see how viable it is:  \- how well does it work with Microsoft products  \- how much ""worse"" regarding privacy are Amazon's products compared to Google?  \- is what I said in my opening paragraph viable, or am I not achieving anything basically? I am just worried of being locked in with Google at some point."
Ask Alexa to have Sam Jackson sing you happy birthday…you’ll thank me later.
"For over a year I've been using spotify on my fire HD 10. I say ""alexa play spotify"" and it plays spotify. I can pick different songs. The only thing I could never do was get alexa to pause spotify. I always had to stop it manualy, or use a workaround like ""alexa play jeopardy"" ""alexa exit"". Kinda annoying but not a big deal. As of about a week ago, I tell alexa to play spotify and it says ""spotify is not supported on this device"". I'm still able to start spotify manually by navigating to it on the tablet, but this doesn't make any sense. Why would it work a week ago, but now it's not supported? It's driving me crazy :("
"I can't find any threads on this sub about it, but the Samuel L Jackson voice is available now. You have to ask her to ask Sam Jackson stuff and he will reply, but you can't just replace her with his voice =/"
Has anyone tried to invoke Alexa for Business skills through a Alexa Routine ?
So I was listening to an audiobook book from Audible on my Alexa echo dot when all of a sudden the audiobook cut out and alexa played some white noise with muffled voices as if you were flicking through radio station then just went straight back into the audibook...  Has this ever happened to anyone before or have any explication?
So I had a fire tv working with my tv (obviously) and my Sonos playbar. All Alexa communication would come via the playbar and when asked things like to spell a word there was often a visual on the tv.  I added an echo yesterday and was expecting the echo to be an extension of the fire tv remote but that’s not the case. Alexa speaks through the echo and no visual any longer.   Is it possible to configure the echo to work more primarily via the fire tv?
I have various lights hooked up (some through SmartThings some through Smart Life) and I always would say “lights on” or “lights off.” Now I can still say “lights on” but I have to add TURN in front of the lights off command. Just curious if other people were seeing the same thing. It’s been happening the past 2 weeks or so. Alexa says “I don’t know how to set lights to that setting.”
"I recently got a second echo device, and have them grouped with different set of lights in two different rooms. In each room, Alexa understands “turn off the lights in this room,” or turn off the light in living room, for example.  However, “turn off lights” doesn’t work. In one room, where’s there’s only a single light (let’s call it light A) the command doesn’t do anything. In the other room, it turns on light A but not B. BUT, if I say “turn off light,” singular, then all the lights in the room go on, as would be expected with “turn on lights.”   Light A is a Kasa plug, the other two are TanTan. All are selected to act as ‘lights’ in the group.  Anyone know why Alexa is having grammar difficulties?"
"Hi All,  As the title, I have had Echos since the beginning but the last few days this has started happening, anything I can do, change, disable?  It also does the same now for playing books on Audible, previously I could say Alexa play harry potter and the chamber of secrets, but now she replies no video skill or something like that (I can check later for confirmation..) so now I have to state 'On audible' at the end.  Quite frustrating when it has worked fine previously for years!"
...and in that moment I immediately learned its volume is defined 1-10.  (Obvious in retrospect - but boy it was dicey for a minute there.)
Looks like Amazon developers been hard at work again. Can now use IFTTT as an action in routines as well saw you can use Alexa Guard as a trigger.  Applets are pulled from the Alexa trigger “say a specific phrase”  https://i.imgur.com/qjTUqpk.png  https://i.imgur.com/NbUG9i2.png  https://i.imgur.com/ArOllvT.jpg
"Now that we have IFTTT functionality - how are you going to use it? - I don't have much in home automation, just lights and sockets for lamps.  Can anyone suggest some clever routines utilising IFTTT?"
"I remember a while back they got rid of it. Just wondering if there have been any updates or talk of it coming back.  I have a 3rd party YT app on my FireStick, but wasn't sure if that was available on any of the Echo Shows."
"Is linking the Apple Podcasts service new? I try to add it, but it says that the skill no longer exists."
"My dad switched the household over to Firesticks about half a year ago, getting three in total: two for the first floor (kitchen and den) and one for upstairs (parents' bedroom).  AFAIK, Firesticks do each contain a fully capable Alexa to control each unit.  Is it therefore redundant to get him a couple of Echos in addition?"
Can you control your iMac with Alexa echo? Or atleast turn it on or open apps?
"I had my speaker on and it came to a part that in no way sounded like ""alexa."" and alexa triggered. Then I replayed the scene but nothing happened. What is going on?"
"Just got my new FireTV Blaster for my FireStick4K. I understood that, with the IR Blaster, Alexa is supposed to be able to verbally execute all the commands available on the remote's buttons, including combinations of keys, even scrolling up, down, left and right, but even though I believe I followed all the setup instructions correctly, so far I haven't been able to get any verbal commands working except turning TV on and off and I had to do that myself by setting up Routines to Smart TV Remote instead of the Blaster!   Has anybody here had better luck?   I thought FireTV Blaster was going to be the easy-peasy way to the magic, but so far no luck. My circumstances do not make use of the FireStick's physical Remote very easy, so I thought the Blaster would be the ultimate solution, but so far very disappointed and hope the geniuses on Reddit can come to the rescue!"
"I have to put my dog in her crate when I leave because she’s being destructive, can I teach Alexa to say “Quiet” and how would I do that"
"My Haodeng wifi Smart LED bulb uses its own app called **Magic Home** and I've got the Magic Home skills enabled on my Alexa.   The app lets me choose light changing patterns (gradual, blinking, etc) but I can't find how to activate them via Alexa. Also, Alexa doesn't seem to offer option colour changing patterns.   I've only had my Alexa a few days so wondering if there is a way to do this. I want the light to gradually change between red and green.   Thanks!"
"I’ve always had 4 echo devices. They’ve always worked well in that only one responds to me, despite multiple devices hearing me. I recently bought a 5th echo device. Shortly after setting it up, one of my echo devices asked me something along the lines of “Did I respond from the device you expected?”  I said yes. Ever since then, every time I use Alexa, more than one device responds, but only one at a time. IE. I’ll ask Alexa what time it is. The device I expect to respond tells me the time. Then after that I hear a second echo device in a separate room tell the time as well. Sometimes a third. I can’t figure out what the issue is. Anyone else have this issue?"
"I have two smart plugs, each named completely different. They are both in a grouping called Lights. She will turn them on when I ask, however when I say turn them off: “I don’t know how to turn lights to that setting” is what I get. Any suggestions? (One is an amazon plug, one a Wemo)"
"Hey guys,   &amp;#x200B;  I can't seem to get my routine to dim the lights over time. I've tried this with two different lights and its not working. So i'm assuming I'm doing it wrong.   &amp;#x200B;  I have it set to Power: on; Ramp Brighnets: 0% in 5 min  Is that right?"
"If the dimmer functionality works fine using the Wemo app but the dimmer slider function or voice command to dim lights (""set light\_name to y%) doesn't work using Alexa, try deleting the device in Alexa and manually adding it."

"My brother is now in a nursing home.  I want to put an Alexa Show 5 I bought in his room.  The idea is that his wife, mom and I could drop in and talk.  However we all three have separate Amazon accounts.    &amp;#x200B;  Is there a way to setup a trust or something so I can 'drop in' on his device from my account?    &amp;#x200B;  Do we need to just set them all up under his wife and then login with her account?    &amp;#x200B;  Please advise... thanks!"
"Lately, when I ask Alexa to turn on a particular light, she answers with ""sorry the provider is having trouble"", I will then go in to the Alexa app, in device settings, and there are  2 of each light listed. I can then delete the duplicate, and everything works fine, a day later, everything is duplicated again. Does anyone know what can be causing the lights to duplicate. Echo dot Phillip's Hue lamps and bridge  Thank you for any help."
Is there an alexa skill that lets me listen to unwatched podcasts that I've subscribed to?  Rather than requesting a specific podcast or podcast episode.
I bought a new Echo Dot 3rd gen. In the ad it shows a digital clock reference showing. How do I get this to show the clock?
"Hello,   So yesterday I bought the echo show 5 and I have a problem with the connection.   It has wifi access (even says that the connection is good), but everytime I ask Alexa to start or something else (like who is that person) it never shows a picture or opens anything. It only shows a blank screen and gives me an answer.   I've checked my router and even opened up the 5ghz network but it didn't change anything.  I really hope somebody can help me because I can't find anything on google.   The only picture I can see is the homescreen."
I just started using Alexa guard with my ring system and so far I like it.  I would like to know if I would be able to use the lighting features of Alexa guard (random lights turning on and off) if I have zwave switches or outlets connected through ring.  I do not know if they will show up under the lighting settings in alexa guard.  Right now I can control things though my ring security (like my door locks) but I have not bought any switches yet and I really want to use this feature of Alexa
"I bought my family Echo Show 5's for Christmas presents, but I just realized that the Amazon Fire tablets can be used as an Echo Show.

So what are the reasons to get an Amazon Echo Show over a tablet?"
I have two robotic Evovacs N79s vacuums. The older one is already paired with Alexa. How can I make alexa recognize the new one? The name I create in the Evovacs app doesn't seem to be recognized by Alexa
My Dads a musician and has recorded a few Christmas songs.  I want to  be able to play these on Alexa and leverage the multi room speaker group audio capability to play these songs.  So far I cannot find anything that will accomplish both of these needs (local music and multi room audio). Am I missing anything?
"I have been using Alexa to control all of my lights and fans for years now. All of the sudden, she will not understand “Living Room Fan” or “Bedroom Fan”.   She thinks I am saying the phrase minus the word “Fan”. So “Bedroom Fan” becomes “Bedroom” and my lights are activated. It’s annoying as hell.  Any idea how to fix? I have to stress that it’s been working for years. I tried creating a “Bedroom Fan” group and it didn’t help."
I woke up in a shock this morning to Alexa blasting really loud music and when I couldn’t get her to stop using voice commands I unplugged my echo dot. My fireTV will now no longer be able to be turned off/on using Alexa. When I give the voice command to turn it off Alexa just says “sorry something went wrong...” any suggestions on how to fix this.
Getting sick of having to skip the same song every time I ask her to shuffle playlists.
"So up until today, I had a light group set up, my Phillips hue bedroom light, and a led strip in my room, made by a company called magic. They worked fine and when I said “Alexa lights off” they both turned off.  This morning, when I said lights on, Alexa said there were lots of devices called lights, so I said Alexa “Oliver’s lights on” only the Phillips one turned on.  I’ve looked at the app, and they are both in a group. I can call out the led strip by name to Alexa, and it will turn off/on , or I can turn the group off via the app and they will both turn off/on, but when I call the group out to Alexa, only the lightbulb one turns on.  How do I fix this, and how do I get Alexa to respond to”lights off” not “Oliver’s lights off”  The worst part is it worked perfectly last night, but not this morning  I have tried removing and adding the LED strip to the Alexa app and to the group"

"A family member is essentially blind and has Echo for music/news etc.  There is a vast collection of great media in BBC podcasts. BUT she cannot use Alexa app on phone and therefore cannot select episodes visually.  I have tried AnyPod and Global player and TuneIn but do not seem to be able to achieve the following:  I need to be able to ask 'play a SPECIFIC episode (by NAME) of a series from BBC program'  I KNOW you can do 'previous episode', or 'next episode' but this is no good because not all episodes are of interest.  &amp;#x200B;  For instance:  Alexa ask XXX to play BBC Podcast 'In our time' episode 'The time machine'  OR  Alexa ask XXX to play BBC Podcast 'In our time' episode 17th October 2019.  &amp;#x200B;  I am able to select and give her the command to say but it MUST play specific, random access, episodes.  Any skills that make this possible with ONLY spoken commands?  Thanks"
Finally you can name routines in the app!
"I have been watching Smart Home Solver YouTube channel for inspirations!   Here’re the few automations I have done:  1. when I enter the house, Alexa will recognize it’s me who’s entering (through my location and face recognition) and give me a personalized welcome message. Turn the lounge lights on, turns the entertainment system (TV, PlayStation and sound system) and plays my top 2019 Spotify playlist.   If it’s not me who’s entering (property manager/maintenance person), it won’t do anything I mentioned above but... give me a notification on my watch and phone to let me know there’s someone and asks me whether I want to view the security cam.   2. When my partner or I get up late at night to use the restroom, the light strips under my bed will detect motion and light up the strips to like 20% so you can find your way to the restroom without waking up the other person or struggle to find where the light switches are.   3. Smart lights understand my behavior and when I’m out of town, the lights will mimic my presence exactly the way I use it. So it doesn’t all turn on like at 6 PM and turn off at midnight. So it’s pretty cool.   4. Ambilight (Govee smart light strips) behind my tv, mimic the colors on my TV so when I’m watching a movie or playing games - I’m fully immersed.   It’s pretty cool to play with smart home setup. Watch a few videos by Smart Home Solver. He’s a legend!"
"I got my first Alexa device yesterday (snagged a Show 5 during the sale) and I'm instantly addicted. I also ordered a Flex but it's not in stock until Dec 30th.

"Spotify is setup as my default music service on Alexa.   I made a playlist on Spotify called **Massive Merry Christmas**.   When I say ""*Alexa, play Massive Merry Christmas Playlist*"" she always plays **Massive Merry Christmas Radio**.    I've read some posts of other people having trouble with Spotify playlists and there doesn't seem to be a consensus solution and there's a lot ""take it out, blow on it, stick it back in"" or ""wiggle it"" advice.   Does anyone have suggestions that don't include uninstalling everything?   Thanks!"
So I’ve just started using Alexa again after ignoring it for a year. Loads better now!  I’ve set it up with morning routines and integrated it with my Ring alarm to set / unset and lock the house down.   Any other tips to create that Tony Stark /JARVIS experience? Share your thoughts.....
"Both my Wife and our 6 year old daughter heard my voice coming from the alexa device today while I was at work.       They didn't catch all the words, but when my Wife paused thinking she heard me, our 6 year old stopped as well and said, ""Yeah I heard that too"" before my Wife even said anything.       This is the 2nd time we've had this happened in the past few months.  Any idea?  Is it playing back previously recorded voice commands (like me asking it to do something from before?) or maybe cross communication with someone else's alexa device that just happens to be a guy as well?"
Is it possible to add guard to a routine?
"This happened yesterday: I wanted to listen to SomaFM's ""Xmas in Frisko"" channel (if you like non-tradition and possibly offensive holiday music, you'll love it), so I asked Alexa to play it. I pronounced it ""xmas"" because that's how it's spelled, and also how they pronounce it on station IDs. Alexa successfully found the station (after a couple attempts at the right syntax - what finally worked was ""Alexa, open SomaFM"" and then ""Play Xmas in Frisko""), but she responded ""OK, playing Christmas in Frisko"" (and on failed attempts, she said she couldn't find ""Christmas in Frisko"").  So, apparently, when she hears ""xmas"", she maps it to ""christmas"", and while searching, ""xmas"" will match ""christmas"", but she always says ""christmas"" and never ""xmas"", regardless of how I say it or how it is spelled on the found resource.  One might imagine a conspiracy or agenda to ""put the Christ back in Xmas"", but more likely it's just doing it to improve success at responding to christmas/xmas related requests. Anyhow, I found it mostly amusing, yet slightly irritating."
"I've set Alexa to wake me up every day to my playlist on Spotify but it looks like she only plays the first song every time, can you randomize it?"

"I recently purchased a new Alexa echo. The model with better sound. The alexa worked last night, now all of a sudden it won't. How can I fix this problem.

"   I ask Alexa (as usual) ""What is on TV tonight?"" Get times only after midnight as of recent.    No skill needed for this. Been doing this for years. Usually it will say at 8pm so and so is on......  I am in Eastern Standard Time--equivalent to New York.  When I ask the question it is now telling me what is on tv after midnight regardless of when I ask this question during the day.   So in other words I get same answer if I ask at 8am, 3pm, 6pm EST.  Time on cell phone correct, time on router correct.  Not using an Alexa skill to ask what is on TV  If I ask Alexa what time is it, I will get the correct time..  Odd only happened recently.  So I went into Alexa app and ensured all setting were correct for US, Eastern NY time. I then changed the time zone to something else and changed back to correct time.  I also rebooted router and Alexa devices...Still no change. Tells me what is on TV at :12:06am.  Strange, thoughts???  Thank you   Peter"
"Hi, I recently got an echo dot and wanted to make Alexa play an mp3 in a routine. I’m not entirely sure whether it’s possible or not so I thought I’d consult here for help."
"Pretty much says it all, it’s been doin this for about a week now.. 5 mins into a song then just nothing, anyone else having problems?"
"Would it be ok, and would anyone be interested in seeing Alexa products I am looking to sell?  I have the following:  1 x First gen Amazon echo  1 x Echo spot   2 x First gen echo dot  1 x Echo Auto  If it's allowed I can post some pics."
"Is there a way to make my lights flash? In the Alexa routines I can only set to come on for 5 seconds then off for 5 seconds, not really flashing."
"Hi all, I've been having this problem for maybe 2 months now, where the volume standards (not the settings on the Echo itself or in my app) have changed to become louder.  For example, what I used to consider 'volume 4' is now 'volume 1', meaning everything is louder than it used to be.    The audio setting for that particular echo in the phone app is already set at 10%, and I didn't change anything myself recently.  Even when I set it to 0%, the volume is still what I would consider the 'old volume 3'.  Basically, I can't get anything to play at an actual quiet level anymore.  Is there a workaround?"
"I originally assumed that Alexa could not turn on my TV because I didn't have a hub. Whenever I say, ""Alexa, turn off/on livingroom tv"" she says, ""sorry the hub that is connected to didn't respond"". Fair enough I thought.  But today, instead of Prime music, I accidentally said, ""Alexa, play Amazon Prime"". She turned the TV on and opened Prime.  Um, what?  So how do I actually control this since clearly she CAN."
"I'm looking for a whole home audio solution using a legacy audio receiver. Basically, my parents have an ancient set-up, with a separate 6-disk CD player, audio receiver (which also receives inputs from their record player, although I've never seen them use it), and wired speakers throughout the house. The speakers finally gave up the ghost after 40ish years, and my mother wants a solution that will allow her to play her CDs in the living room, and be able to hear them throughout the house. My first thought was Echo Dots for the speakers and set up a group so that it'll play to all, but I haven't found a good way to get the audio to them without replacing the receiver. Has anybody set up a similar system and can give me some advice?"
"Hey guys, hoping for some help, I bought a new Toshiba Smart TV on black Friday and it works with Alexa. I set up the TV with alexa and it worked fine for a very short while but it is extremely unreliable and will more often then just straight up not work, with alexa either making the noise meaning its completed my command but nothing at all happens on the TV, or straight up saying the device TV is not responding despite it recently working, anyone have any advice on how to make this work properly?"
"Greetings everyone,  I recently bought a Google Nest thermostat and I wanted the thermostat to turn the AC off at a specific time but couldn't figure out how.  what works is when i ask Alexa to:  **set the AC mode to off**  the command above works but i can't think of a way to integrate it into a routine."
"Hey guys like my title says. Has anyones Alexa said anything weird and not something you've said. She told me today thumbs down, lights off thats the way we like to what?.     Or something along those lines. It scares the absolute crap out of me when she says it. As she doesn't really care what time it is when she says it. Its not repeatable and theres no voice cards or recognition in the app.."
"Hello, On my fire TV, when I press the power button it turn on my receiver and my TV. I would like to say ""Alexa turn on TV"" to do the same action that pressing power button on fire TV remote. Can't figure how. Is this even possible ?  Thanks for all the answers."
"I’ve tried looking through the articles announcing the release and the Amazon detail page,  ur found few details.  Will we be able to put the FireTv Blaster into groups?  Similar to how I can be in my living room and say “Turn off lights” and all lights in the echo’s group go off. I’d like to simply say “turn off tv” and have that groups tv turn off.   The closest I have no is a bunch of harmony hubs I’ve hacked together, but I still have to give all but one a nickname.   For context, I have 5 rooms with tv’s and would need to set up 4 blasters (one room will keep the harmony hub because of the complicated set up).  Of course, if no one knows, I’ll just be guinea pig."
"When i say ""bedroom lights on"", or or just ""lights on"" while in the bedroom it turns on both the bedroom light and the closet light. even though they are set up as separate rooms in the app. when i say ""closet lights on/off"" it only turns on the closet. please help."
"I am rather dumb and I have two new Echo's.  I'm just looking for some help and I'll try and explain this as simple as possible.  I have a Kitchen &amp; Bedroom Echo.  I like to use the skill ""Calm My Dog"" when I leave my dog home alone, and say it to the Kitchen before I leave.  Now sometimes I forget, and I've tested this.  How do I enable the Kitchen Alexa from my cell phone?  When I do it from the Alexa app, it just plays on my phone and I don't see any feature to switch it to the Kitchen.  Like how I can do that with Spotify.  Any solutions on this, and any other cool features a new Alexa owner may not know."
alexa seems to be taking forever to update? it’s been like 45 minutes and still updating. any troubleshooting that can be done? is there a way to cancel the update?
"Recently, I purchased a couple of wemo smart plug Minis to use for Christmas decorations. I have no problem controlling them from the wemo app/HomeKit. However when controlling them when they are in an Alexa group, it says the server is unresponsive. If I remove the switch from the group and ask Alexa to control it individually all is well. I have tried firmware updates, factory resetting the plugs, removing and unliking the Alexa skill and reinstalling it all without results. I have looked across the internet and couldn’t find any solutions that helped."
Is there a way to add a routine with Alexa to open Xbox and an app? I know you can make a routine to turn your Xbox on but I’m trying to figure out if I can say “Alexa start my day” and it turns my Xbox on and also opens twitch.
I have tried a few times to share my laptop screen with my fire stick so that the PC image will be shared to the TV screen but I can't get it to work.  Any ideas?
"So I have an 07 Civic, and it has an aux port but no Bluetooth. I'm wondering if I could hook the echo input up to my car and use it as a Bluetooth connection. So for example, if I had the echo input hooked up and started my car, would I be able to connect it to my phone and then start up Spotify on my phone and choose a song and have that play through my car speakers? I mainly want a setup like this since 1) the Echo Input is $10 atm so it'd be a cheap solution and 2) I find myself using voice assistants while driving a lot more, and it's a pain in the ass to pause the music or turn the volume down whenever I wanna trigger the mic (my phone's mic doesn't always hear the catchphrase)"
"My grandparents just bought an Echo and a Dot and asked me to set up the devices for them. I took the Echo out of the sealed box and plugged it into the wall. The ring lit up and it went through the set up and suddenly said it was connected.  I didn't do anything with any apps, or the website. It just connected to the password protected Wifi without needing the password fresh out of the sealed box. The echo did the same thing. No password, but at least it needed to be directed to the correct Wifi through the website.     Can someone explain how on Earth it did that? I am sure it is password protected because I set their router and everything as well and put one on there."
How do I make Alexa to call someone in Viber?
"While setting up my second Dot I was asked to assign a room name to it. I called it ""office."" I would like to remove that room name but don't have the vocab to google it. (I keep getting ""change wake word"") Long pressing on the Mary's Second dot opens up settings for that dot but no option to delete the designation. Thanks for any help."
"Hello,  Is there a way to turn off masking of entries on the lists, because apparently Alexa is more tuned to urban dictionary slang than I am?   I cannot write ""flange"" on a shopping list named ""Hardware"" --- I am actually going to the hardware store to get an actual metal flange. I had to go to the urban dictionary to see what the offending word was.  Hopefully some one knows how to turn off the masking of ""bad"" words because I am a big boy, I can choose for myself. Thank you for any responses."
"I've got an outbuilding office/shed which has a chest freezer in it. Recently the circuit with the chest freezer on it tripped for some reason, which was a pain in the arse because we're only out there a couple of times a week so everything had defrosted by the time we realised.   I'm trying to find some way of being alerted if the breaker trips again but it turns out to be harder than I expected. Just thought maybe I could use Alexa to help. If I bought a cheap Alexa-enabled device and plugged it into another socket on the same circuit, I figure I could set it up so I get an alert on my phone if that device goes offline. Is this possible (for someone not especially techy)? If so, would anyone be able to explain in fairly simple terms how I'd do it please? Or does anyone have any other ideas please?"
"So when setting up my Echo Auto, I noticed that Alexa pulsed like K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider.  Now I love some vintage Hasselhoff, but this pulse got me longing for a Knight Rider feel.  Anybody know of any Alexa skills that could get me back to that pulsing light?  Or any skills that would make Alexa sound like kit? I know that the Garmin had one available.  Thanks Reddit community."

"I'm trying to get my Echo Show and Sonos Beam working ideally so that the Show responds to commands but all audio is through the Beam speaker.  I have them in the same group, the Sonos is set as the default speaker.  They both have Alexa enabled but I've made the trigger word for the Show 'Echo' and Sonos is still ""Alexa""  At this point if I say something like ""Echo play some music"" is will respond on the Sonos (i.e. ""Here's some music you might like"") but then the actual music plays on the Show.  So I feel like I'm close but must be missing something.  Few other bits:  \- Want the Show because we have a Ring doorbell so want the visual aspect.  \- Not sure if I need to have Alexa enabled on the Beam or not.  When I disable it, the Beam shows as Offline in the Alexa app so I re-enabled it.  Any help would be appreciated - happy to answer any questions/provide more clarity etc."
"I just tried setting up Plex to work with my Win 8.1 (32 bit) server, an Echo Dot, and an Echo Link stereo streaming device. When I say ""Alexa ask Plex to play X"" it will work on my echo dot, but when I say ""Alexa ask Plex to play X on Echo Link"" nothing happens.  Has anyone managed to use Alexa to stream materials saved on their home server on to an Echo Link using Plex?"

Has anyone had any luck getting Alexa to play their spotify wrapped playlists. I added the Your Top Songs 2019 playlist to my playlists but no matter what I try it won’t play it.
"I'm posting this here because I was having a hard time trying to control my sonoff since the last firmware and app update (eWeLink V3.5.0) and I wasn't able to find a solution anywhere.  The problem was that after updating both Alexa was able to discover my sonoff but then failed to control it by voice command. I deleted the skill, reset the sonoff, re-added everything through the Alexa app and the result was the same.  It wasn't until I realised that in the eWeLink app they added a new feature called ""LAN control"". This feature can be enabled o disabled in the eWeLink app on the upper right corner button, selecting Enable/Disable LAN (more info here [https://support.itead.cc/support/discussions/topics/11000001799](https://support.itead.cc/support/discussions/topics/11000001799)). After disabling it everything went back to normal and I was able to control the sonoff with Alexa voice command.  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR  My Sonoff stopped working because the LAN control was enabled in the eWeLink app. Disabling it restored everything back to normal"
"I recently moved my Echo to the garage. I use Apple Music and usually have a drop down option to airplay on my Sonos, other speakers, just not the Dot. Every time I ask Alexa to pay Apple Music she belts it out on the Sonos and not on the echo? How do I fix this"

"Earlier this year, Alexa worked just fine with smart switches and smart bulbs. Integration with Harmony was always disappointing but more for lack of features than lack of understanding.  Has anyone else noticed this change?  For example, the command: ""Alexa, turn on the light"" is now failing most of the time. The error varies between Alexa doesn't understand (mishears as ""lights"") or she and asks ""Did you mean light?"" or it appears to work but the light remains off.  (There are other commands too.)"
Anyone can provide feedback on how to set this up?  Thanks!
"i've had sengled bulbs running with alexa for about a year with no issue but, after creating a new routine involving Turing individual bulbs on and off now every time i try to turn all of them off and on randomly with display ""there was a problem"" in the app, ive tried deleting all the bulbs in the alexa app, factory resetting the sengled hub, and factory resetting the alexa and still getting the same problem. all of the bulbs work fine in the sengled element app. im not sure what more i can do to just wipe the slate clean and re set everything back up to how it was working before."
"All I get is either ""Hmm, I don't know about that."" or a 'ba-donk' sound. Getting tired of Alexa telling me to ask her something, then acting like it doesn't exist. Why does she do this, and how can i fix it?"
Saw this for sale and looks like a great deal but seems misleading.  Claims no hub required but yet Echo Dot doesn’t have control over ZigBee devices.  So can Alexa control bluetooth smart home devices?  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W4RYPPY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_q1W6Db95501WE

"Sorry if this has been posted before, I just joined.  However I was wondering, can Alexa turn on a TV with a Firestick plugged into it?  The firestick remote alone can turn it on. But, I noticed in the app there isnt an on/off option. Its a Samsung smart TV, but Alexa cant connect to it like I was thinking she could connect to the firestick. I have enabled Alexa to work with it in the Firestick settings. I can have her open up Plex/Netflix/etc. Anyone know what Im doing wrong or would I have to have a FireTV?"
"I’ve got an Alexa routine set up where telling Alexa “Merry Christmas” will turn on the Christmas lights in our living room and start playing Christmas music through the external speaker connected to our Dot.  I’ve also set up so that Alexa will respond by saying “Merry Christmas to you as well”.  This is working as intended.  The problem I’m having is that after saying “Merry Christmas to you as well”, Alexa will also say something along the lines of “Sure, here’s the Holiday Favorites station from Amazon Music”.  Is there any way I can stop her from saying the additional sentence.  FWIW, I have brief mode turned on and that didn’t solve the issue."
"Anyone else encounter this recently? I use Echo as the wake word.  A few weeks ago, I could reliably say Echo stop from the living room if the echo was playing music. The echo plus is in the kitchen. Now, it  barely responds even if I'm shouting.  Did Amazon change something?"

(How about this station, Shawn Mendez)   FFS! Really? That machine is obsessed with Pop. My usual playlist is Chromeo, Keane, Cold Play, Daft Punk, Phil Collins, even The Elder Scrolls Skyrim music. They really need to filter out genres. I do have Amazon Music Unlimited but even though she changes station she keeps going back to today's pop hits which I'm fed up of. At moments I just want to throw it out the window lol"

"I recently bought the echo dot + 2 hue bluetooth lights, and they work fine. The only thing I can't solve are routines: if I set a routine to turn on the lights at 8:00AM, and my phone isn't on by that time, the routine simply doesn't trigger. Is there a way to fix this?"
"We just recently got an Amazon plug. My wife and I have separate accounts, but are part of the same household. The plug was registered through my account.

"I'm buying a Echo Show 5 for my dad for Christmas.  He's extremely anti-technology.....I just upgraded his home DirectTV and ""land line"" phone to DirecTV + Phone + Internet (costs $7 more a month with internet then before).  He has never used a computer and in general doesn't like new things.  But my sister and I both have Alexa devices in our home and he does like the idea of asking it for stuff, like playing music, and it doing it for him.    &amp;#x200B;  So the question is how do we handle the account?  I have Amazon Prime &amp; Amazon Music Unlimited Family.  He doesn't have any online accounts.  We set him up a email address so we can do his bills online but otherwise doesn't even know he has email.    &amp;#x200B;  I have a very extensive home automation system so I'm weary of adding his device to my account and him accidentally turning something on or off in my house.  And I recently found out when I replaced my daughters Echo Dot 3rd gen with a Show 5 you cannot enable ""Free Time"" on it, which effectively locks out home automation control.  I also don't really want to create him a amazon account that will never be used because then he can't take advantage of me already paying for amazon unlimited music.    &amp;#x200B;  So whats the best way to do this?  Add a new amazon account but lose access to the music unlimited or add him as a ""child"" on my account and risk possibly messing up my home automation system?"

"Hi! My parents recently bought an Alexa Echo device and are struggling with Spotify. They have a premium account and after saying 'spotify connect' they can use their phone or computer to control Spotify and play songs over the Echo speaker. However, saying things like 'play Spotify' or 'play Daily Mix' prompts her to say that a premium account is needed in order to use Spotify.   I have checked the account, Spotify is set as default device and like I said, they can play Spotify with their personal devices on the Echo.   Does anyone know how to solve this?   Thank you!"

 I have a Spotify family account (each user has own profile) and several Echos. On my account (I’m the primary) I can see all of the echos listed under the “Connect to a device” in Spotify - I believe because I have my account linked in the Alexa app - however no one else in my family can see this.

"So I just got an Echo show 5 over Thanksgiving weekend and I've placed it in my kitchen where it's the most useful, in the same general vicinity as my Gen 2 Echo which straddles the kitchen and the family room. I initially wanted to do a stereo pair before I realized you can only do that with two of the same device, so as a workaround I created a multi room music group with them and that's been working out pretty well so far.  My question is whether or not there is any voice command I can use to have them both answer a question if asked while listening to music, ie who an artist is. Right now if I ask a question it's only answered by one device while the other one continues to blast.  Thanks for any responses."
"Hi... this is getting frustrating... so I have the TanTan outlet plugs (2) - one for the living room and the other for my home office.  On occasion, one of the timers would be out of sync - ie.  lamps would not come on at the defined times AND go off.  I don't know if it's the TanTan or the Smart Life app (I suspect it is the latter) as the time would shut off (this past Daylight Savings on Nov 3) an hour earlier than what I defined it to be...  any way, timer would not come on/off and I would have to remove the device (office light as an example) in the app and reset the TanTan all over.  Then the next time, it would be the Living room lights.  Rinse.  Repeat.  This is getting old."
"So we can set Guard as Away in a routine but there's no option for setting it as Home. I've seen other explain the workaround but i was extremely confused. I will give a step by step on how to accomplish this...  The workaround is to use the default trigger, ""i'm home"" and other actions to that routine...

"My family has multiple Alexa devices. I have my own Amazon account, as do they. We share Prime membership. I guess because of this, my Alexa dot lists all of their devices and i even get some of their notifications (like something at the front door) even though I live many states away. In the app there’s no way to remove them as I see, and only have my one dot. Google hasn’t helped much either, I’m afraid deregistering the devices will take them away from their account which isn’t what I want either. I just want their devices not on my account. Any ideas?   Thank you in advance"
I groggily thanked my Alexa for turning up the brightness in my room and then felt kinda stupid once I realized what I did.  But at the same time it could be a cool option to have just for teaching kids manners and for making her feel more human.
the echo show 5 can replace entirely the echo dot?

"I want to set up a front door monitoring system with a very easy to use monitor for a person that can't use a smartphone.  He has an old  Surfboard 5101 and WRT54G and poor wireless strength where the monitor would be located. I know very little about Alexa but have a few questions.   I assume I should update both modem and router in the hope of getting better signal in the front room. Recommendations for good but not expensive  system for Cox cable?  He doesn't need Amazon Prime and I think I can set up a camera to use with Alexa without paying a monthly fee right?  Besides router/modem, I would need Alex Echo, Front Camera (Wyze?), and Echo Show monitor also?  I would like a reliable system and something he can easily see and has to be very easy to use but hopefully without spending a ton of money. It would be nice to also monitor it with my smartphone (Pixel 2) if possible.  Any help or recommendations appreciated. Thanks!"
"Hi,  Do you want to have a virtual assistant in your smart home that doesn’t send everything about you in the cloud? An assistant that cares about your privacy and it is open sourced ( and I’m looking at to you Alexa, Siri and Google). In this video tutorial I will show you one it is called Almond, it is created by Stanford University and it works great with Home Assistant.  [https://youtu.be/vmNp2RTGY6Q](https://youtu.be/vmNp2RTGY6Q)  [Almond: Privacy-Preserving Virtual Assistant integration with Home Assistant \(Video HOW-TO\)](https://preview.redd.it/2cygecr6ln241.jpg?width=360&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a79924769a5f1f9519dd731b5e59a3712982bc43)  You may wonder what Almond is? This is the first open-source, social virtual assistant that can be run on local devices to protect privacy. Among other things, Almond allows you to control Home Assistant using natural language. Once installed, it will be available on Home Assistant web Interface via the microphone icon.  I hope that you find this tutorial useful and definitely stay tuned for the other tutorials that are coming up.   Let me know what do you think?  Cheers,   Kiril"

I thought it might be slightly more informative to include a time, but I can't find any documented way to ""programmatically"" add that in to the announcement text, if at all possible, i.e.: Alexa says, ""Today's sunset was at {hh.mm}""  Any thoughts?"

"I am listening to news on my Echo right now, not talking to it at all.  Suddenly I get an email ""Welcome to Amazon Music Unlimited"".  I did not order this!  Checking the order it is for 1 month at $7.99, then a promo credit making the invoice $0.00.  Sure, I'll keep the trial and cancel before 30 days, though I've already had one earlier this year.  What bothers me is how this happened."
"Setting reminders isn't working for me.   Because they go off and I might not be paying attention or even in the same room when they do.   So they get lost in the sands of time.

On my brand new Echo 3rd Gen, all I get is a Beep Boop sound and she ignores it and continues playing that same music station etc. All my other echo devices understand the Alexa, No... command but this new Echo 3rd Gen does not seem to understand that Alexa, No is an actual command to do something.   Is it working for you? Also what device?"

I have looked all over google trying to solve this issue.   I have 2 echo dots that have linked for music playback. If I open my Spotify app I can select that group and everything plays fine.   What I want to be able to do is tell Alexa to play that playlist on both devices.  I can only get it to play on both devices from amazon music. Is it not possible for Spotify? If it is what is the command?   Thanks!

My mother really struggles with technology. Her hands are shaky so she can’t really use a phone or tablet or laptop. She can just about manage a tv remote. Last year we got her an Alexa and she loves it. 90 percent of her uses with it is playing music on Spotify but it’s awesome to have some technology that she can really use.   We’d love to be able to message her throughout the day and hear her responses. Are there any good skills that allow you to send voice messages through the Alexa to a group chat on a mobile phone app and that can also read out messages sent from the app? Also ideally you would be able to view videos and photos onto a television through a chromecast or some other device I could buy. Am I completely dreaming here or is there any skills like this?

Not a big deal, it's one extra word, it's just annoying to change my habits. It worked fine before, I don't know what changed. Is anyone else seeing this?  For context, these are device groups created in the Alexa app made up of Philips Hue bulbs and Wemo outlet switches. It's happening for groups with only Hue bulbs and groups with both."

"I've had my Echo Dot for two days. It was a gift from family. I've asked it to play a game twice. It recommended Word of the Day both times, but I chose the Skyrim game and a choose your own adventure game those times.  Tonight, I was watching some DnD videos on Youtube, and saw a Game Theorist video about Jeopardy cheating. I thought it might be interesting. After all I haven't seen, heard, or thought about that game show in a decade. I forgot it existed, and a breakdown of it could be entertaining. So I watched the video and closed YouTube. A few minutes pass.  Oh a whim, in a quiet room, I ask Alexa to play a game. Of course, she says ""Hm. I think I have a game that you might be interested in, Jeopardy! Do you want to play Jeopardy?""  I know coincidences happen, but Alexa recommended something I have not shown any interest or even awareness of for a decade. I have nothing on my Amazon account about it, no search history, and have not clicked on anything with the word in it besides this one video. The first time I've even acknoleged the game show existed in 10 years, and then Alexa is telling me it ""knows I'm interested in this game"" minutes after I stop watching a video about it.  There is literally only a single point of reference where anyone could have connected that game show to me in ten years. The video I just watched, with my Echo Dot sitting next to my desk."

My literalness is being abused by the household not having an identity unrelated to both of us, so I just wanted to clear this up :)  Cheers!"

"I have a whole home audio system where the receiver and amps are in the basement and that has an echo dot connected to it. I use a Harmony remote as our physical remote and often control the Harmony using multiple Alexas in our main living area. I’ve then set up a handful of specific Alexa routines such as “Alexa, Black Keys” that first turn on the stereo using the Harmony integration, then play a preset playlist specifically on the echo dot in the basement.   Problem is playing music that doesn’t have a pre-configured routine. I first have to say “Alexa, turn on first floor audio” (harmony command) then  “Alexa play beatles on kitchen audio” (the basement echo dot is named “kitchen audio”). Since that has 2 very specific steps, our nanny and the kids’ grandmothers almost never use the whole home audio, and 1-2 times a week I find them listening to music out of a single echo dot.   I know Amazon at one point added a way to force all music requested from a particular echo to play on another specific echo device. That helps, but I don’t want to leave the whole home audio receiver and amps on all of the time.  Anyone aware of a setting such that ANY music request would trigger turning on the stereo via Harmony?  The Echo Input doesn’t have a speaker - is there a setting on it that would potentially enable this if I replaced the dot connected to the receiver?  Would IFTTT help?  I realize when the music stops the receiver and amps would remain on, but I have a scheduled routine that turns them off at night."
 A couple of weeks ago reddit was in inundated with ads for a light switch that had Alexa built into it.  First..... what were they called and / or what site were they from  Second ... are these certified or something by amazon  Third. Does anyone have one that can comment on how they work???
"“You already have milk on your shopping list.  Would you like to add it again?”   Who on gods green earth answers yes to that question?  Is there a way to get Alexa to stop asking that.  With two kids in the house, my list is 90% cookies, fruit loops, and milk."
"I’m a Prime member but don’t subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited. Before this weekend, I could ask Alexa to play a specific artist or album and she would. As if Thursday, I only get playlists. I can’t figure out if this is a change to Amazon Music or if something isn’t connecting properly. Anyone else encounter this?"
"     I recently bought an echo flex with the motion sensor, the echo flex works fine it’s just that the motion sensor won’t trigger routines. I can even see when it detects motion in the Alexa app but it doesn’t trigger the routine. Does anyone know a fix for this?"
"So I live in Finland and I would like to buy Echo Dot. I want the version with the clock so I cannot get the international version and my only options are to get it from Germany or UK.  Now I'm wondering that if I get German version, put it into English, will it miss some skills etc compared to the English version? I know that some skills and stuff wont work in Finland in general and I'm fine with that. So basically in Finland, will German Echo Dot in English be exactly same than UK version?"
Thank you!
I'm in Canada I'd that makes a difference.  I go to settings &gt; account settings &gt; Amazon household.  I get my wife to sign in to her account. Then I click join household. But it doesn't seem to work. We ask the echo dot to switch accounts and Alexa just says there's only 1 account registered to this device.  So we tried again. This time it asked to send a code to my wife's email. Did that. Punched it in. Clicked join household.  Tried again but Alexa responds the same.  Alexa recognizes our voices and made profiles based on that. But the problem is if my wife plays music it uses my Spotify account and not hers.  Not sure what to do now. I even tried to do it just the the alexa.amazon.com site instead of the app but same problem.
"For example, if I ask Alexa ""How much do I weigh?"", she won't know, but if I ask her to ""Ask Withings 'How much do I weigh?'"", she'll give me the right answer. Rather than giving me an ""I don't know"" answer in the first case, she should automatically check any of my skills to see if they know an answer to this question.  If multiple skills claim to have an answer, she could say ""Skills A and B both have answers to this question. Which would you prefer?"". Then after I select one of them and she gives me the answer, she could then ask ""Would you like to set this as the default skill to that question?"". To which I could say ""Yes"" or ""No"".  This would significantly streamline the use of skills and make the entire experience more natural than always having to ask her to ask a skill (many of which have difficult names to remember)."
"My grandmother is getting up there in age. She had Google Speakers before, but I really wanted Amazon's Drop in feature so that I can call her if she is not answering (Duo calling on Google devices requires you to manually answer). I just picked up an Echo Show 10 for the living room, a Dot for the kitchen, and a dot for her bedroom.    Problems...  I want to be able to drop in on all of her devices.   -- If I'm not in her household there doesn't seem to be a way to select which device I drop in on, it always goes to the Echo Show 10.  -- I can't add her to my household, I already have two adults.  -- I tried to add myself to her household. It doesn't give me any error messages, but it doesn't work (because I'm already in my own household?).   Google let's you add yourself to multiple households and you can press a drop down list to pick what home you're interacting with. Does Amazon really not have this feature?   Google let's you add as many users as you want to a household. I understand Amazon is different because of Prime, but is this really limited to just two adults? What if you live with roommates or adult children - Are you just SOL?   The only solution I've found to this problem - Just stay logged in to the Alexa app with her account. I don't have any Alexa devices myself, so I don't need to use the app on a day to day basis (I don't plan on using ""Drop In"" unless she doesn't answer the phone)... but there has to be a more elegant solution that that right? What about people that just have more than one house?"
"Does anyone know why the sleep sounds function has gotten so weird lately? It’s been cutting in and out (every 30 seconds or so), and becoming quiet, and then stopping altogether.   This has only been happening the last few weeks but it wakes everyone up."
"Hi, I recently got an echo dot. I really like it, however, there is a shortcoming I see. In the routines menu, there's no way for Alexa to essentially ""give herself a command."" This feature exists on Google Home, so it's definitely possible. Thus, I ask you, the wise people of Reddit if there are any workarounds or skills that can do this for me. Thanks!   Also: I know there are other threads with this same premise, but they're all old so..."
"I’m not a huge fan of the white noise options in skills, plus I need it to play in 3 different rooms. (Dog has separation anxiety). Ideally I’d love to be able to say “Alexa I’m leaving!” And have the 3 different units turn on instead of walking through each room and doing it manually.    I’ve tried googling but all the results I find are how to USE Alexa as a white noise machine.    Alternatively, I’d be fine with using smart outlets instead (I actually have 2 spare ones) but all our current white noise machines have to be manually turned on, just turning on the outlet won’t start the noise."

"Whenever I search online for a speaker dock for my 2nd gen Dot, all I seem to find are “portable” charging speakers. I bought one a year ago, and now it’s dead. Because it won’t hold a charge anymore, I can’t even use it as a plugged-in speaker anymore, and I’m looking for a replacement.   And suggestions out there for a dock I can connect my Dot to to give me better sound? Ideally under $60?"
"From the notification I get I can only choose between ""switch to mobile data"" or ""another network"

"I'm in Canada, and just got an Echo Dot.  For the most part Alexa knows I'm in Canada, she gets local weather, and finds local businesses.  I order regularly with Prime from [Amazon.ca](https://Amazon.ca).  However Alexa always says I dont have any open orders when in fact I do, but she does give me a notification when they have been delivered.   If I add something to my cart with Alexa, it doesn't show up in [amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca) but does in [amazon.com](https://amazon.com).   If I ask Alexa for local movies, she says something along the lines that that my account is set to US and she cant find local movies.  How do I smarten her up?"
"I released my first skill for Alexa. It can recommend you what to wear based on the current weather conditions. You can ask questions like ""Alexa, ask weatherproof what to wear today"" and it will respond like ""Currently it is partly cloudy in New York with a temperature of 44 degrees Fahrenheit. For walking I recommend a cap, a scarf, a jacket, thin gloves, long pants and sturdy shoes. The max temperature is 50 degrees. You can switch then to no cap and no gloves.""

"Hello all! I hope this is okay to post here! I recently purchased myself an Echo 3 and I love it so far! I showed it my mom and now she's bought one for downstairs too haha  I need help though, basically, i was up in my room, and asked alexa to remind me of something in 15 minutes, no problem, my problem is that when that reminder was due, it read it out on my mom's echo and mine, and sent us both notifications to our phones.   We don't want that to happen haha. We have both set up our own voice profiles so it must of know it was me asking for the reminder, so why would it tell us both? Is there a way to change this?  Thank you so much in advance!!"

"Ok so this a real brain buster. I bought the 3gen dot with clock few months ago. Works great. Even has learned the way I prefer to say things for actions and it’s impressive.   I have a group named bedroom. This has my 3gen, amazon plug, and Xbox. Up until 2 weeks ago everything worked flawlessly. I could turn devices on and off independently as well as just saying turn on or off bedroom.   For what ever reason I can now turn on the bedroom, but when I ask Alexa to turn off the bedroom it says “cannot find device or group named bedroom.” Even though she just turned the group on moments ago.   I called support. Deregistered and registered factory reset and renamed and re did everything in every imaginable order possible. I did all of this with support on the line.   Please help!"
Can you make calls to other phone nymber using my phone number using echo dot 3rd gen?
"i always listened to my favourite music station with alexa just by saying ""alex, play &lt;&lt;music station&gt;&gt;"".  now I DON'T KNOW WHY but suddenly alexa doesn't play MY music station anymore, but some random international music station that appears to have the exact same name.  is there any way to override which music station gets selected if they have identical names?  oh and btw, I think I'm using TuneIn. ;)"
"I can't wait to not be fiddling with the annoying PS3 controller remote to turn on my tv and just watch netflix. I have other consoles, but for my bedroom, I just through an older one in there because it was the only one with a media remote.

Also been fairly impressed with the apps (in Canada)  Except, I wish I could remove ones I don't ever use from suggestions. Stop suggesting me CTV content, I'd rather die than support Bell media lol  They're super on sale for Black Friday - and if anybody was thinking of a simple smart TV addition without breaking the bank, I certainly recommend.

"We are trying to setup our Amazon Alexa at a friends house for music today. Alexa told us to use the help section of the App, but there is no longer a help section as far as i can tell, so i used the ""setup device"" option in the settings section. I clicked on the device type, but when i do, it says that the app needs an update to setup Alexa, and it takes me to the app store; but on the app store there is no option to update the app, only to open the app again. I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling, but it still persists in doing this. Im using the app on a Kindle Fire, if that changes anything.  How do i fix this issue and setup Alexa?"
" [Amazon](https://twitter.com/DailySupplyUS/status/1200170584782577666)  I  had the 2nd gen Dot every since i came out, I never used it to play  music, because the speaker quality was just not fit to play music. Then  yesterday I got this new 3d gen Dot, and gosh, not only the sound  quality improved, the volume also improved! The speaker quality on the  3rd gen dot is really good, i would even say it is better than my 2nd  gen Eco!!! The sound from this 3rd gen Dot is loud, but smooth, unlike  the 2nd gen Eco which hurts your ears when playing at loud volume and  sounds are all distorted. My only complain is when playing music around  volume 8-10 it can't hear me calling her name, and i have to scream on  the top of my lung( like if someone were to stab me kinda scream) for  her to hear me. So now i just walk to her and control her instead of  using my voice because I'm too weak to scream to her multiple times a  day.

"I am looking for a nightstand voice assistant and trying to decide between these two. Right now, I can order the Show 5 for only  €15 more. Does attaching a screen to an Echo give any benefits over a Dot and a smartphone? Or are there any drawbacks compared to a gen 3 Dot with clock? I've read the Show has less microphones and worse sound. I'm going to use external speakers anyway, but what's your experience with the Show's voice accuracy?  Most importantly: how does the alarm clock screen compare to the Dot's clock face? Does it look good when dimmed in the dark? I always use a #000000 black wallpaper with white text on all my devices. Do the blacks look good, or is it a shitty LCD with noticeable backlightig?"

"After I shower using a bluetooth speaker I have (UE megaboom). I turn it off, go to my room where my Echo Plus 2 is and from either the spotify app on my phone or through voice command ask Alexa to play Spotify.  The thing is it never works.  If I unplug and plug it back it will work but its not convenient to repeat that on a daily basis.  Eventually after some time pases it will work again (without the need of replugging).  If tried turning Bluetooth and Wifi on and off. Closing and opening Spotify a numerous other things, also googled with no luck.  Anyone has had this problem before?"
"I have been jumping up and down about this I can't figure if I am the only one in Australia or what. I've read vague forum posts and such alluding to other users have the same issues. I have tried for literally years now to get support for this via the Amazon Customer Service and I never ever get an answer or proper fix, no matter what I'll open the app again and have this issue again.  Whenever I open the Alexa App on my iPhone to change settings on devices ALL the devices connected via my Echo Plus show as ""device unresponsive"" until I perform an action on that device or I sit it at the devices screen for around 30 seconds and then the actual status will update.  Devices via my Hue bridge always show the proper status (just 3 lights at the moment). The devices via the Echo Plus are Hue, LiFX, ""generic"" smart lights via zigbee, smart switches connected via WiFi, robot vac, tap timer, stereo, TV.  From what vague reading I have found the issue is because the ""Alexa Servers"" for Australia are based in the US so the issue is the latency. Are Amazon aware of this issue? I know this isn't an official way to contact them but I just hope maybe the Alexa devs or whatever actually visit here and read this and are even made aware that your whole ecosystem in Australia appears to be useless because of this issue.   Are other Australian users experiencing this? Or even users in general? Is there something I am possibly missing?"
"I’ll try to set it up to a specific playlist, but everytime, when the alarm goes off, it just a generic alarm sound and not the playlist I asked."
"This is one of the things I absolutely hate about software as a service apps. Amazon’s latest update to the Alexa app has removed one of the features I used daily. I used to be able to browse through all my Pandora stations in the Alexa app and select one to play, but now the genius programmers in their infinite wisdom have determined that I no longer need that feature and removed it.   So now if I want to pick a Pandora station I have to either remember the name of it (I have too many to remember them all) or I have to open the Pandora app, find the station I’m looking for, and then ask Alexa to play it by name. Or I could obviously Bluetooth in but that kind of defeats the purpose of connecting Pandora to echo.   So frustrating. They just removed the feature I used most for no apparent reason."
"Half the time I say “Alexa, turn on bright in living room” she responds with “You have flashlight enabled, would you like to use it?”  I only have echo dots, nothing flashlight compatible.. is there a way to disable flashlight in setting so I’m not prompted with this annoying mishearing?"
I have been trying to pair a Bluetooth transmitter with Alexa. She can’t see it. I’ve tried using the App to set up a new device. Still nothing. The device is both a transmitter and a receiver.

"I ask her the time, she tells me and then says something like ""I hope you had a great day.""  I don't want her chattering at me. Do what I ask and leave it at that.  I already have brief mode on.  For the love of god, please don't make her personable."

I want to be able to put a record (I have a lot of them) on my Uturn turntable and have it play on  the stereo system it is hooked up to AND have it play on all of the Alexas that I have throughout my house in other rooms. Anybody know a way to do this? I am stumped.
"I set-up an echo mini in the kitchen for my partner a while back and she loves that she can listen to music and control the central heating (Hive) just by asking Alexa. She has also got an original firestick which is struggling a bit now.   For Christmas, I'd like to extend the lounge functionality - basically update the firestick for TV but also allow music (mainly radio) on the device and control of the heating plus some smart plugs I'll also get for lights.   My plan is to get a fire cube and replace the ailing firestick. Would this do everything she needs? (i.e. not only control the tv watching but also allow her to just ask for the radio on the cube itself).  Thanks in advance for any advice."
Anyone have a workaround for this? I can tell Alexa to play on the other multi room music group that contains the echo plus and it will then show and replace the other multi room music group that contains the echo plus in the Spotify app but I’d like to see all multi room music groups in Spotify at all times so I don’t have to switch by voice and can do it within the Spotify app.

"Hey all,   What's the best way to configure or use devices with Alexa, things more like AC and TV/ Xbox then just lights. Im finding it a bit hit and miss.   If I create a room group, especially with AC, while I can say. Alexa set room to 22c. Turning it off seems to be difficult.   She says, setting the AC to 22c. But I cant just say, turn off the AC. Or even turn off the Thermostat. Even though it comes up as that under device type.   I'm mostly concerned about the AC because its the most expensive to run. Sometimes when Alexa mishears something it just turns on everything in the room.   Is there some guide on the best way to set up rooms?  Thanks"
"I'm getting my wife an echo dot for Christmas, and I see there is a sale on Amazon for 3 dots and the smart plugs for $64. I have no idea what Alexa can do, but here are a few things I would be looking to do:  1. I have a roku tv, but I'd like to use Alexa to turn my tv on and watch shows/movies on Netflix, Hulu, etc and listen to music through voice commands. Do I need a firestick for this to work? Or are there limitations to this even with firestick?  2. I want to listen to music in the shower or wherever I put a dot. Is there any way to play the music on my phone with voice commands through Bluetooth, or will it only play streaming like Pandora? And will I be able to listen to music on all 3 devices?  Those are the only things I'd like, I'm sure my wife has more uses. Are there any advantages to having 3 over 1?"
"Seriously, I wanted to listen to some music from youtube, I got 2 echo dots in a deal, set up the multi-room, only to find out it only works when I say hey alexa and play it through the amazon app?  That is SO inconvenient and frustrating for me, I was really looking forward to listening to my youtube playlist.  Does anyone know a work around for this?"
"I apologize if this is the wrong sub to ask this, but I'm tying to decide between the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube. I don't need the mics and voice assistant of the Cube because I have a Sonos Beam soundbar with Alexa baked in (plus other Sonos and Alexa devices throughout my home). Are there any other advantages to the Cube?  The Cube has more storage, but I only use a handful of apps. So I don't think that will be a big deal. Perhaps a bigger deal is that the Cube has more RAM and a faster processor. Is there a noticeable performance difference in daily use? I hate laggy interfaces. But if there's no noticeable difference, I prefer the discreet aesthetic of the Stick and would prefer not to have the cube chilling on top of my otherwise austere and minimalist media center."
"I have some wifi bulbs that are smartlife and plus minus. They do not appear in the Harmony app. But Alexa can use them happily.   Is there a way to get the Harmony remote to use these?

I haven't changed or added anything new in the last 6 months so I don't know what's changed. She'll still turn lights off or change colour but not scenes.   Any advice would be great!  Thanks"

How can I stop declined events from showing up in Alexa? To make matters worse the person that sent the declined event is no longer around and the event was set to repeat daily for 5 years. So I can't delete the event and for whatever reason Alexa thinks its a regular active event.
"So, I have 2 Gen 2 Echo devices. I have quite a few smart plugs and smart bulbs that use with them. Everything was fine when I first got everything about 8 months ago, but now I find myself having to repeat commands.  I'll say, ""Alexa, turn the living room lights off"", and even though the response is ""Okay"", nothing happens, and then I have to say it again for it to work. Is this just a situation where I need to upgrade my Echo devices?"
"Hi, yesterday I set up my Echo and Firestick, The Audio from the TV I have the Fire Stick connected isn´t that good. It would be great if the audio could come out from the Echo, as well as from the TV... Is this possible?  Thanks!"
"As the title says, I'm thinking of switching. Here are the features that are broken on Google that I'd switch to Alexa for:  1. Reminders. On Google Home, when you set a reminder, at the time it reminds you, it says, ""you have a reminder"", and then you have to ask it to tell you the reminder. This is a really dumb system. Can I set Alexa to give me a reminder and have it just tell me the reminder without me having to ""unlock"" it? 2. Ability to shut off verbal responses. With Google Home Mini, I control my Philips Hue Lights, and every time I make a change to the lights, Google gives me a verbal confirmation. I say, ""Google turn the lights down to 50%"" and Google says, ""Okay, turning the lights down to 50%."" I don't know why, but I find the verbal response really irritating, maybe because it's a mood killer. Can Alexa change my lights without saying anything? 3. Discrete volume control. Google Home Mini only has 10 volume levels, and the difference between 0 and 1 is huge, so it's near impossible to get a decent low volume setting. Can Alexa handle volume in finer increments? Like, work by percentage?  Looking forward to hearing the experiences of Alexa users on the above! Thanks!"
"I bought a new router, and hooked it up. I then connected my smart devices to it normally. After everything was connected, I stopped the SSID broadcast for security reasons. My three 2nd gen dots could not connect anymore. My 1st gen cube and 3rd gen dots were cool. I do not want to broadcast my SSID! Any suggestions??"
I’ve tried restarting it and the app. It just kept saying it was offline. I tried setting it up again but it won’t connect at all now. When I choose a network it takes me to the amazon page to log in to my account but it won’t load the page. Out of ideas
"Complete newb to Alexa. My wife and I have separate Amazon logins with separate payment methods, etc. I bought an Echo Dot 3 and setup a To Do list. A week later, my wife orders the same model of Echo. She set's it up and looks at her To Do list, (on the phone Alexa app). All of my entries are viewable there.   We want separate lists. Is this possible?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks \~"
"Since day before yesterday, if you ask Alexa to play music from Spotify on one Echo, it is randomly picking another Echo to play it on!  Having to turn off Echo's to get it to play in my son's room for his nighttime sleep music.  Infuriating!!!!!!  Anyone else experiencing this?"
"We have 3 alexas in the house, when i tell the one in my room to play music, it connects to my sons ipad, not my phone. how do i fix this? i want to be able to play music on each one with each connected to one device"
" Is it possible for Alexa to ask you what time you want your alarm set to as part of a goodnight routine?  You can do it with Google, but I’m playing around with switching because I know have a ring doorbell,"
"Last week I rejoiced because this worked:   Alexa ""t*urn on Lamp 1 and Lamp 2*"",   but....  This week it did not work.  Instead you now have to say Alexa ""*turn on Lamp 1 and turn on Lamp 2*""  What gives?   Its regressing...   Not only is it getting more verbose... its requiring you to be more verbose also."
"Hi. I switched my echo plus 3 with the echo show 5. With the echo plus 3 I Said, ""alexa, start Netflix"" and it would start Netflix on my fire stick. Now that I have the echo show, alexa thinks I want to watch Netflix on the show display, and tells me this doesn't work. ""alexa, start Netflix on fire stick"" also doesn't work.  Can anybody help?"
"I have an Echo Dot and a Fire TV Stick 4k.... And if I'm reading all the posts correctly, there is currently no way to just ask the Echo (and I don't want to use the Fire Stick remote - that *literally* defeats the purpose of hands free voice commands), to play music on the TV through the Fire Stick.... ***Unless*** I add it to a multi-room group that includes the Echo Dot. I don't want to listen to music including the crappy Echo Dot speaker. I want to use my sound system through the Fire TV.  How does that make ANY sense? Is this just so I go and purchase a Fire TV Cube? It *obviously* has the ability to send audio to the TV..."
For the past three years I could say things like: Alexa turn on relax in the bedroom and the bedroom lights would change to the “relax” preset.   Today when I say turn on relax in the bedroom she says “there’s more than one device named relax in bedroom” which is not the case.   Any suggestions?
I've set up Alexa on my Laptop and on my Moto G6. On the G6 hoever I cannot seem to get it to add items to my calendar. It is adding them however from my laptop. Any ideas?
"Can anyone help pls. New to Alexa, have bought a dot and fire Stick for the sole purpose of viewing my Ring cameras on the TV.  If I use the fire Stick remote and say 'Show front door' she shows me that. If I ask the dot to do the same, but use 'show front door on fire tv' she tells me that cameras do not work on this device and to link my fire TV with this device.  How do I do that? I can see the dot and the fire in the Alexa app so assumed that's what it needs but alas I am wrong."
"Just got my Echo Dot, but whenever I ask it to do something it takes a long time (around 10 seconds) to respond. Does anyone know why it does this?"
"I've got follow up mode enabled on all my Alexa devices but some of them do not work; my Echo show and at least one dot do not work, regardless of what I do I cannot get follow up mode to work, whereas my Echo and Echo spot do work.  &amp;#x200B;  Has anyone else had a similar problem but got it to work? If so, what did you do to resolve it?"
This is really annoying. Sometimes my Echo signs into my daughters account all by itself. It calls me by her name and has her Spotify account. Why would this happen and is there anything I can do to stop it?
"A few years back my wife and I bought an Echo for my in-laws.  We liked the idea of it as an emergency resource for them in the event either needed help.  At the time they didn't have a Prime account of their own so I set it up on mine for them to try.  They liked it and used it so MIL got her own Prime account.  Now, occasionally my Alexa devices will ask if my wife or I are her.   Her device is disassociated with my account and I would like Alexa to forget her but I do not know if that is possible or where to do it from."
"Does anyone else think routines are a bit underdeveloped, love my echo but wish I could type in text commands like I can in Google assistant. Do we reckon it's something that'll come in due course?"
"Hi, I'm looking around for a good budget indoor bluetooth speaker..    So no need to be waterproof, no need to be ultra portable, no need to be capable for ""outdoorsing"", just a wireless speaker that has an as good as possible sound as is reasonable for the price..    Basically looking for something ""budget"" for under 50 bucks, however google isn't exactly helping, just returns the same shit over and over again, ignoring any and all search parameters I give it, so it just ends up suggesting those tiny outdoor speakers like the anker soundcore 2        So does anybody here got any suggestions for me? All I really care about is the sound, clarity, bass, etc.. Don't care about battery life or anything like that, as I'll probably yank out the battery and hardwire it anyway (if it has a battery)    Any suggestions would be very much appreciated"
The rgb controller is a cheap Chinese one it works with my phone but i have no idea how i can connect it to alexa this is the app the instructions told me to use http://www.ledmagical.com/Apps/MagicLightLED/AppDown.aspx thanks to everyone that helps me
"I've set it up and it can turn the tv off with it but only turns it on maybe 1 out of 5 attempts and I can't seem to get it to do anything other than turn the tv off it can't open apps or anything, is there a way to get it working?"
"I asked my Alexa this, and she says “I’m sorry, I don’t know that, but I have a skill you might want to try called Fart.” .... WTF.  this happened on my girlfriends, too.  anyone else experience this?"
"So, I’ve had my Alexa for awhile now. I used to have a routine where it would turn my lights on at 8:30 in the morning. I deleted the routine, and it is no where to be found, but every Thursday my lights still come on at 8:30. I have no idea how to fix this, any ideas?"
"Does anyone know how to turn other people’s notifications off from there Alexa device?? We share prime, but I have my own login for it... so I’m not sure why I’m getting notifications about her amazon orders..  HELP!!!"
For fuck sake.
Alexa follows by saying: starting Disney plus on Firetv. But 9 out of 10 times it starts PlutoTv on the NFL or Hillsong Channel. Even if I leave off the + or leave off the On Firetv part. In order to start Disney+ reliably I have to specify that and add a show name as well.
"So I am wanting to put an alexa into an ensuite bathroom I am doing and I figured one way of doing it is doing an in wall mount for echo dot, but if i want to have echo show like features and still be wall mounted I was looking at puting an Fire HD Tablet into a wall and having in in show mode... that basically converts the tablet into echo show screen...  now comes the challenging part... at first I was thinking of physically connecting some in wall speaker and bob's your uncle, but from all the googling I did, only info pops up are Bluetooth connectivity speaker solutions...  Question I have, if i have a table paired with the speaker, will it always be paired, will it ever ""time out"" things like that, anyone have any experience with this?  and another question, anyone got any recommendations on a good Bluetooth speaker for wall/ceiling?  Thank you kindly"
"I have a few smart plugs and they work ok (on-off) but I'd like to have a couple of lamps on a smart-dimmer that I could control with Alexa, but I haven't found any.  Got any resources for me?"
"I'm sure most of you know about the nice little daily fact you get when you say ""Alexa, good morning"". Occsionally, she will tell me to ask her a question or tell a joke. Today I got told to ask what her favourite flavour is, pertaining to a fact about Mr Whippy. She proceeded to answer my question with ""I don't have an opinion on that."" The mind boggles at how she never answers questions of this nature, despite JUST telling me to ask. Is this something New Zealand is not allowed to have?"
The heating in my flat is really bad so I have been using a Dyson fan but it has no timer to automatically come on and needs the remote to be used to turn it on. Is there any way that I can control the fan with alexa and other Alexa devices to get it to come on?
"Like come on Amazon. I know you want us to subscribe to Amazon Music, but only letting us set music alarms from your own service is kinda cheap. I've seen people post about this issue a few months back but I never found a solution for it. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks."
"I have an echo and echo dot that I play music through. I just got a nest mini, does anyone know if I can combine them all into a group?"
"With the latest version of the iOS app, I can't figure out how to ""browse"" through my music, amazon music, etc..  There used to be a ""browse all"" link, but it's all been replaced with various ""recently played"" stuff.  I'm sure it's right in-front of me.  Help?"
Support had no clue. The previous web based credentials will expire tomorrow and I would like to enter the new ones so I can use the drop in function over the next week while not present at the device. Any tips?
"So for months the Echo Auto worked great. But now it forgot key contact info and seems unable to relearn it.   Previously:  “Alexa call my wife.”  “Calling *******”  Now:  “Alexa call my wife”  “Do you mean wiiiife?”  “Im sorry i dont see that in the contacts, tell me your wife and I will remember it” (never remembers).  Anyone know what is going on? Maybe related to one of the new iOs updates? Thx"
I am using an echo dot (2nd gen) in our kitchen and it‘s connected  with a Bluetooth speaker because of the better sound quality. Is there any way to keep playing music with the echo dot while also playing the same music via Bluetooth (so I get stereo sound)?
"I’m thinking of getting my folks a digital frame where they can upload their latest photos, etc. After reviewing - I’m thinking I may opt for an Echo Show instead. As long as they can upload photos to Amazon - the Show could be similar to the frame...plus play music, video, etc.   Am I missing something? Anyone have thoughts or recommendations?"
"If I ask Alexa to play, for example, Queen, the songs that play will be the most famous ones. Is there a command that will make her shuffle every Queen song?"
I have created 2 routines in simple commands to open and close my garage door with myQ. When I link Alexa to my simple commands account the routines will not show up as an available scene in the Alexa app.
"Over the last couple of weeks a problem has been developing in my system and I am unsure where to turn now. At this point, Alexa will not control any of my Alexa Control Groups. For example, I have a group called kitchen with, as you would expect, all my kitchen lights. If I say ""Alexa, turn off the kitchen"" Or ""Alexa, turn of kitchen"" she responds with ""I'm not quite sure what went wrong.""  I have tried update the group name, deleting the group altogether, renaming the group to an entirely different name, creating a new group with a not previously used name, and none of them help.  This is now occurring across all my Alexa control groups. These are not groups or scenes in Smartthings or Philips hub.  To answer the next obvious question, yes, she still can control each device individually."
Last night a spent a while trying to ask my Alexa to play various Jackson Browne songs and she would only respond by playing “Happy Happy music” Then this morning I asked her to play “music from the 1940s” several times and she responded with “music for family time”  Has anyone had similar issues to this?

"In the UK here, previously I could ask ""how are the Swans doing?"" And if the Swans were playing, alexa would tell me the score. Now ot only tells me their league position etc.  The Swans are playing Millwall right now. If I ask ""what is the current Swans score"" Alexa's response is, ""right now in the championship""...   WTF!   I just tried asking for the current Everton score, and the response was, ""right now in the English Premier league.""  Is Alexa no longer able to provide love scores?"
"I live in Belgium. Amazon.com only sells dots with an American power plug, while amazon.fr or amazon.de refuse to ship Amazon products outside their respective countries. Wtf, Amazon? This is by far the worst organized ""big"" company I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I used to avoid Amazon at all costs because they required a credit card. Turns out things get even more complicated than that..."
"""Alexa, play Lost for Hope."" I know I misquoted the song title and meant to play Lost for Words by Pink Floyd but this is what she responded with, "" I can't find this song Lust for Poop in your music library."" Seriously, WTF!"
Is there a way to turn OFF (not On) with Alexa? I cant find a proper guide on the internet and really need u guys help  Thanks alot!
"I've recently made a new playlist on Amazon music unlimited, I ask to play it on my echo and it doesnt play. Please help"
"For the past four years or so, I've had rooms in my Hue app named exactly what they are.  My kitchen has been named ""Kitchen"", my den "" Den"", etc.  A while back, I started having a weird issue where one specific scene (one I named ""soft"") would not work if I said ""Alexa, turn on soft in the den"".  Alexa would ding as if the command completed but nothing would happen.  I found that, to make it work, I would have to drop the word ""the"" and say ""Alexa, turn on soft in den"".  It was only that scene that had the issue.  I could still say ""Alexa, turn on bright in the den"" and it would work fine (along with every other scene).     Recently, it's gotten to where most of my scenes fail to work properly.  Tonight, I said ""Alexa, turn on bright in the kitchen"" and her response was something like ""Did you mean kitchen?"".  I would say ""yes"", she would ding as if the command was successful, and nothing would happen.  I just renamed all of my rooms in Hue from ""Kitchen"" to ""The Kitchen"", ""Living Room"" to ""The Living Room"", etc, rediscovered devices, and now things seem to be working just fine.  Has anyone else experienced something similar?  Is this due to some change Amazon made, or is there just a glitch in my matrix?"
I wish to add a skill to my English Alexa which I know is available from amazon.fr. It is called 'Journal en francaise facile' but it isn't showing in the UK. Is it possible to add?
"I just got a 3rd-gen Echo. I need it for white-noise when I sleep. However it seems (upon first glance at least) that Amazon Echo isn't great for this. From what I've read many skills have ads built in them, and will wake me up if I don't buy them. ok, fine.  1. How do I purchase a subscription? I don't see the option anywhere in the skills page (on mobile or desktop) of the full description page of the skill. 2. Even if I buy a subscription and have the premium service, will Alexa really still interrupt the skill in the middle of the night with other ads and suggestions as I've seen from other posts? 3. When setting up a bedtime routine, I see I can select a specific ""enabled skill"" as an option, but I can't seem to figure out how to use a specific sound within that skill. For example I can select ""Sleep and Relaxation Sounds"" which has like 100+ different sounds, but I can't seem to tell Alexa which one to use (via the routine, NOT using voice commands). Am I missing something or does this functionality not exist?  I really want to keep this device. I really want it to replace my Google Home Mini, as it sounds much better. But so far the routine builder seems underwhelming, especially coming from Amazon, the one who owns most of the smart speaker /assistant market. Right now I can just tell my Google Home Mini ""goodnight"" and it automatically adjusts volume and starts playing ambient noise without any ""piano notes"" tone, and no jarring half second of static that Alexa somehow uses. Does anyone have any suggestions? I'd prefer to not have to make a 200 song Spotify playlist of white noise tracks in order to achieve this, but if there's no other option I might try it."
"Hey y’all, so I’m in the process of setting my house up to be a smart home, so I purchased two ring doorbells, two smart deadbolts, and an Echo Dot 3 to go in my kitchen. Setup went well for the most part, however, my other echo, which is the larger Echo, is a 2nd gen version. It’s in our formal sitting room so I mainly use it for music. But anyway, I setup my doorbells on my front and back doors, and I can only get the newer Alexa I got for my kitchen to announce someone is at the door. Idk what the issue is, I’ve scoured the app trying to figure out the problem to no avail. I really could use some help with this. So how can I “connect” I guess you could say, the Echo to the Echo Dot? Is it because I have a 2nd gen Echo and 3rd gen Dot and they aren’t compatible? I have no issue with buying another one it’s just frustrating :-/ So, if anyone can tell me how to get the two to interact with each other and what I need to do I would really appreciate it!"
"I’ve always been a Spotify user, and I could either tell Alexa to shuffle my songs or choose Alexa as a speaker when I was on Spotify. I recently changed everything over to Apple Music, but it’s not cooperating with my Alexa. I downloaded the Apple Music skill and linked my accounts, but I can’t tell it to play my music or a specific playlist. If I say play my music it will say “Okay, playing country.” Even if I try for a specific playlist from Apple it will still pick something else. I also can’t choose my Alexa as a speaker when I’m in the Apple Music app. What am I doing wrong??"
Hi I might buy the echo studio. Is it worth the money? Some feedback would be appreciated thanks!
I can’t seem to find a way to change the style/position of the clock on my new Show 8 like I’ve been able to on the Show 5.....any help?  Thanks.
"Getting the feeling she doesnt work this way but I'll ask anyway. I have 2 routers, the 1st is a modem/wireless router combo in my office and a 2nd router connected to it with a long ethernet cord that runs to my bedroom.   All my wireless devices and Alexa are connected to the modem/router combo. The router in my bedroom has wireless turned off and has my smart TV, PC and PS4 connected to it via ethernet.   The problem is Alexa will control my TV if I connect to the WiFi connection on the 1st router and not when I'm connected via ethernet on the 2nd router.   I'm puzzled because everything is on the same network unless Alexa just can't work across multiple routers?"
"Hi, I was thinking to bought an echo dot with some Phillips Hue and I was wondering if Alexa can play content on my chromecast natively or with a specific skill ?"
"Hi There:  My boyfriend and I live in different houses, but we often do our grocery shopping together. He has an Alexa device in his house, and I have one in mine. I was wondering if you all knew of any way that we could use Alexa Skills or our devices to have a shared to do list between our Alexa devices in different households. For example, when he's at his house and says ""Add Cereal to our Shopping List"", it will show up on both of our Alexa Apps.  Thanks in advance for your help!"
"Just curious, I have a few various Echo devices of various generations (original alexa tower, gen 2 dot, gen 3 dot, echo show 5) and I want to connect one to my stereo as a remote Spotify player, do any of the devices have noticeably cleaner audio output to an external connection than another? Not sure if anyones really tested it, but if someone knows off the bat would appreciate it, cheers"
I have 6 Wemo plugs in a group called Christmas. Everything was working fine. For the past 3 days Alexa no longer will control them. Just get message “something went wrong.”
